part i item business general united american healthcare corporation the company or uahc was incorporated in michigan on december  and commenced operations in may unless the context otherwise requires  all references to the company indicated herein shall mean united american healthcare corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the company provides comprehensive management and consulting services to a managed care organization in tennessee 
the company also arranges for the financing of health care services and delivery of these services by primary care physicians and specialists  hospitals  pharmacies and other ancillary providers to commercial employer groups and government sponsored populations in tennessee 
management and consulting services provided by the company are and have been generally to health maintenance organizations with a targeted mix of medicaid and non medicaid commercial enrollment 
management and consulting services provided by the company include feasibility studies for licensure  strategic planning  corporate governance  management information systems  human resources  marketing  pre certification  utilization review programs  individual case management  budgeting  provider network services  accreditation preparation  enrollment processing  claims processing  member services and cost containment programs 
uahc s efforts are concentrated on low income families and people with disabilities in select geographic markets 
the company has specialized in the medicaid market for over years and its management team has decades of experience in this sector 
management believes the company has gained substantial expertise in understanding and serving the particular needs of the medicaid population 
as of august   there were  tenncare enrollees in uahc health plan of tennessee  inc uahc tn  owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
in the fiscal year ended june  and its two preceding fiscal years  the company derived a majority of its revenues from uahc tn s managed care services in the west grand region of tennessee under a contract with the state of tennessee  bureau of tenncare tenncare 
in early  tenncare issued a request for proposals and conducted a selection process that resulted in tenncare contracts for only two other organizations to provide managed care services in the west grand region 
consequently  uahc tn will have no tenncare contract when its present contract expires on june  revenue under this contract will be earned through october  as it is expected that uahc tn s tenncare members will transfer to the other organizations on november   and that uahc tn will perform its remaining tenncare obligations through the contract expiration date 
management believes that the discontinuance of the tenncare contract will have a material impact on the company s operations 
on october   uahc tn entered into a contract with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms to act as a medicare advantage qualified organization 
the contract authorizes uahc tn to serve members enrolled in both the tennessee medicaid and medicare programs  commonly referred to as dual eligibles  specifically to offer a special needs plan snp to its eligible members in shelby county  tennessee including the city of memphis  and to operate a voluntary medicare prescription drug plan  both beginning january  the current contract term is through december   after which the contract may be renewed for successive one year periods in accordance with its terms 
as of august  there were approximately medicare advantage enrollees in uahc tn 
industry in an effort to control costs while assuring the delivery of quality health care services  the public and private sectors have increasingly turned to managed care solutions 
as a result  the managed care industry  which includes health maintenance organization hmo  preferred provider organization ppo and prepaid health service plans  has grown substantially 
while the trend toward managed care solutions was traditionally pursued most aggressively by the private sector  the public sector has embraced the trend in an effort to control the costs of health care provided to medicaid recipients 
consequently  many states are promoting managed care initiatives to contain these rising costs and supporting programs that encourage or mandate medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans 
under the medicare modernization act of mma  the federal government expanded managed care for publicly sponsored programs by allowing medicare advantage plans to offer special needs plans that cover dual eligibles 
these special needs plans allow for coordinated care for a specific segment of the medicare population  thus providing the opportunity for improved quality of care and cost management

managed plan the company has entered into a long term management agreement  through a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  with uahc tn 
pursuant to this management agreement  the company provides to uahc tn management and consulting services associated with the financing and delivery of health care services 
services provided to uahc tn include strategic planning  corporate governance  human resource functions  provider network services  provider profiling and credentialing  premium rate setting and review  marketing services group and individual  accounting and budgeting functions  deposit  disbursement and investment of funds  enrollment functions  collection of accounts  claims processing  management information systems  utilization review  and quality management 
uahc tn has a medicaid contract and a medicare contract with agencies of the state of tennessee and the united states  respectively 
the amount of premiums and or fees that uahc tn receives is established by the contracts  although it varies according to specific government programs and may also vary according to demographic factors  including a member s age  gender and health status 
managed plan owned by the company medicaid uahc tn was organized as a tennessee corporation in october  and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the company was active in the development of uahc tn  and through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc  wholly owns uahc tn 
uahc tn began as a ppo contractor with the bureau of tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured and uninsurable recipients  and operated as a full risk prepaid health services plan until it obtained its tenncare hmo license in march uahc tn s tenncare hmo contract was executed in october  retroactive to the date of licensure 
through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare implemented a modified risk arrangement mra with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  under which they became at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and could receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks 
uahc tn received notice from tenncare that it earned additional revenue of million for its performance under the mra for fiscal  representing a bonus revenue payout 
such additional revenue has been recorded  of which million was recorded in fiscal  million was recorded in fiscal  and million was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal uahc tn also earned and received additional revenue of million for fiscal  representing a bonus revenue payout  and the company has recorded such additional mra earnings in the third quarter of fiscal  when uahc tn was notified by tenncare of the amount 
effective july   the evaluation period for the mra was changed from quarterly to annually  and the incentive bonus pool was adjusted to of administrative fee revenue 
as of august   uahc tn s total tenncare enrollment was  members 
on april   tenncare disclosed its decision to award new tenncare contracts to two organizations  not including the company s subsidiary  uahc tn  as the culmination of tenncare s selection process pursuant to its request for proposals for managed care services to be provided in the west grand region of tennessee 
consequently  revenue under this contract will be earned through october  as it is expected that uahc tn s tenncare members will transfer to other managed care organizations on november   after which uahc tn will perform its remaining contractual obligations through its tenncare contract expiration date of june  management believes that the discontinuance of the tenncare contract will have a material impact on the company s operations 
medicare on october   uahc tn entered into a contract with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms to act as a medicare advantage qualified organization 
the contract authorizes uahc tn to serve members enrolled in both the tennessee medicaid and medicare programs  commonly referred to as dual eligibles  specifically to offer a special needs plan snp to its eligible members in shelby county  tennessee including the city of memphis  and to operate a voluntary medicare prescription drug plan  both beginning january  the current contract term is through december   after which the contract may be renewed for successive one year periods in accordance with its terms 
in december congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  which is known as the medicare modernization act mma 
the mma increased the amounts payable to medicare advantage plans such as ours  and expanded medicare beneficiary healthcare options by  among other things  adding a medicare part d prescription drug benefit beginning in one of the goals of the mma was to reduce the costs of the medicare program by increasing participation in the medicare advantage program 
effective january   the mma increased medicare advantage statutory payment rates  generally increasing payments per member to medicare advantage plans 
medicare advantage plans are required to use these increased payments to improve the healthcare benefits that are offered  to reduce premiums or to strengthen provider networks 
management believes that these mma reforms  including in particular the increased reimbursement rates to medicare advantage plans  have allowed and will continue to allow medicare advantage plans to offer more comprehensive and attractive benefits  including better preventive care benefits  while also reducing out of pocket expenses for beneficiaries 
as part of the mma  effective january   every medicare recipient was able to select a prescription drug plan through medicare part d 
financing for medicare part d comes from beneficiary premium payments  state contributions and general revenues 
the monthly premium paid by enrollees is set to cover of the cost for standard drug coverage 
cms subsidizes the remaining  based on bids submitted to cms by plans for their expected benefits payments 
plans can receive additional risk adjusted payments for high cost enrollees and reinsurance payments for of costs above the catastrophic threshold 
a part d plan s total potential losses or profits are limited by risk sharing arrangements with the federal government 
additional subsidies are provided for dual eligible beneficiaries and specified low income beneficiaries 
under the standard part d drug coverage for  beneficiaries enrolled in a stand alone prescription drug plan pdp pay a annual deductible and coinsurance up to an initial coverage limit of  in total drug costs  followed by a coverage gap the so called doughnut hole where enrollees pay of their drug costs until they have spent  out of pocket 
after the beneficiary has incurred  in out of pocket drug expenses  of the beneficiary s remaining out of pocket drug costs for that year are covered by the plan or the federal government 
medicare advantage prescription drug ma pd plans are not required to mirror these limits  but are required to provide  at a minimum  coverage that is actuarially equivalent to the standard drug coverage delineated in the mma 
the deductible  co pay and coverage amounts will be adjusted by cms on an annual basis 
as additional incentive to enroll in a part d prescription drug plan  cms imposes a cumulative penalty added to a beneficiary s monthly part d plan premium in an amount equal to of the applicable premium for each month between the date of a beneficiary s enrollment deadline and the beneficiary s actual enrollment 
this penalty amount is passed through the plan to the government 
each medicare advantage plan is required to offer a part d drug prescription plan as part of its benefits 
uahc tn currently offers prescription drug benefits through its pdp and through its ma pd plan 
dual eligible beneficiaries 
a dual eligible beneficiary is a person who is eligible for both medicare  because of age or other qualifying status  and medicaid  because of economic status 
health plans that serve dual eligible beneficiaries receive a higher premium from cms for dual eligible members 
currently  cms pays a higher premium for a dual eligible beneficiary because a dual eligible member generally has a higher risk score corresponding to his or her higher medical costs 
by managing utilization and implementing disease management programs  many medicare advantage plans can profitably care for dual eligible members 
the mma provides part d subsidies and reduced or eliminated deductibles for certain low income beneficiaries  including dual eligible individuals 
bidding process 
although medicare advantage plans have continued to be paid on a capitated  or per member per month pmpm basis  as of january   cms has used a new rate calculation system for medicare advantage plans 
the new system is based on a competitive bidding process that allows the federal government to share in any cost savings achieved by medicare advantage plans 
in general  the statutory payment rate for each county  which is primarily based on cms s estimated per beneficiary fee for service expenses  was relabeled as the benchmark amount  and local medicare advantage plans are required to annually submit bids that reflect the costs they expect to incur in providing the base medicare part a and part b benefits in their applicable service areas 
if the bid is less than the benchmark for that year  medicare is required to pay the plan its bid amount  risk adjusted based on its risk scores  plus a rebate equal to of the amount by which the benchmark exceeds the bid  resulting in an annual adjustment in reimbursement rates 
plans are required to use the rebate to provide beneficiaries with extra benefits  reduced cost sharing or reduced premiums  including premiums for ma pd and other supplemental benefits 
cms has the right to audit the use of these proceeds 
the remaining of the excess amount is required to be retained in the statutory medicare trust fund 
if a medicare advantage plan s bid is greater than the benchmark  the plan will be required to charge a premium to enrollees equal to the difference between the bid amount and the benchmark  which is expected to make such plans less competitive 
annual enrollment and lock in 
prior to the mma  medicare beneficiaries were permitted to enroll in a medicare managed care plan or change plans at any point during the year 
since january   medicare beneficiaries have had defined enrollment periods  similar to commercial plans  in which they can select a medicare advantage plan  stand alone pdp or traditional fee for service medicare 
for and subsequent years  the annual enrollment period for a pdp is from november through december of each year  and enrollment in medicare advantage plans occurs from november through march of the subsequent year 
enrollment on or prior to december will be effective as of january of the following year and enrollment on or after january and within the enrollment period will be effective as of the first day of the month following the date on which the enrollment occurred 
after these defined enrollment periods end  generally only seniors turning during the year  medicare beneficiaries who permanently relocate to another service area  dual eligible beneficiaries and others who qualify for special needs plans and employer group retirees will be permitted to enroll in or change health plans during that plan year 
we are currently considering several potential strategic alternatives for uahc tn s medicare advantage plan  including partnerships or potential sale of plan assets 
as of august  there were approximately medicare advantage enrollees in uahc tn 
managed plan previously operated by the company for many years prior to november   uahc managed a health maintenance organization in michigan called omni care health plan omnicare mi 
omnicare mi ceased to be a managed plan operated by the company effective november  while managed by the company  omnicare mi was a not for profit  tax exempt corporation headquartered in detroit  michigan and serving southeastern michigan  operating in wayne  oakland  macomb  monroe and washtenaw counties 
its history included a number of innovations that were adopted and proved successful for the industry 
while managed by the company  it was the first network model hmo in the country and the first to capitate physician services in an ipa model hmo an independent practice association model hmo does not employ physicians as staff  but instead contracts with associations or groups of independent physicians to provide services to hmo members 
omnicare mi also created and implemented the first known mental health capitation carve out in while managed by the company  omnicare mi s enrollment was through companies that offered the health plan coverage to employees and their family members  through individual enrollment and through the state of michigan s medicaid program pursuant to an agreement with the michigan department of community health  which made hmo coverage available to eligible medicaid beneficiaries in certain counties and mandatory in others 
as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi was subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which the company did until that agreement s termination on november   pursuant to omnicare mi s court approved rehabilitation plan 
government regulation the company is and or has been subject to extensive federal and state health care and insurance regulations designed primarily to protect enrollees in our managed plans  particularly with respect to government sponsored enrollees 
such regulations govern many aspects of the company s business affairs and typically empower state agencies to review management agreements with health care plans for  among other things  reasonableness of charges 
among the other areas regulated by federal and state law are licensure requirements  premium rate increases  new product offerings  procedures for quality assurance  enrollment requirements  covered benefits  service area expansion  provider relationships and the financial condition of the managed plans  including cash reserve requirements and dividend restrictions 
there can be no assurances that the company or uahc tn will be granted the necessary approvals for new products or will maintain federal qualifications or state licensure 
the licensing and operation of uahc tn are governed by the tennessee statutes and regulations applicable to health maintenance organizations 
the licenses are subject to denial  limitation  suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plan is operating out of compliance with the state s hmo statute  failing to provide quality health services  establishing rates that are unfair or unreasonable  failing to fulfill obligations under outstanding agreements or operating on an unsound fiscal basis 
uahc tn is not a federally qualified hmo and  therefore  is not subject to the federal hmo act 
federal and state regulation of health care plans and managed care products is subject to frequent change  varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and generally gives responsible administrative agencies broad discretion 
laws and regulations relating to the company s business are subject to amendment and or interpretation in each jurisdiction 
in particular  legislation mandating managed care for medicaid recipients is often subject to change and may not initially be accompanied by administrative rules and guidelines 
changes in federal or state governmental regulation could affect the company s operations  profitability and business prospects 
while the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future regulations may be interpreted  regulatory revisions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
insurance the company presently carries comprehensive general liability  directors and officers liability  property  business automobile  and workers compensation insurance 
management believes that coverage levels under these policies are adequate in view of the risks associated with the company s business 
in addition  uahc tn has and omnicare mi while managed by the company had professional liability insurance that covers liability claims arising from medical malpractice 
uahc tn is required to pay the professional liability insurance premiums under the terms of the company s management agreement 
there can be no assurance as to the future availability or cost of such insurance  or that the company s business risks will be maintained within the limits of such insurance coverage 
competition the managed care industry is highly competitive 
the company directly competes with other entities that provide health care plan management services  some of which are nonprofit corporations and others  which have significantly greater financial and administrative resources 
the company primarily competes on the basis of fee arrangements  cost effectiveness and the range and quality of services offered to prospective health care clients 
while the company believes that its experience gives it certain competitive advantages over existing and potential new competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the future 
the company competes with other hmos  ppos and insurance companies 
the level of this competition may affect  among other things  the operating revenues of uahc tn and  therefore  the revenues of the company 
uahc tn s medicaid primary market competitors in western tennessee are tlc family health plan  unison health plan  and tenncare select 
as stated above in the fifth paragraph under the caption general in this item  it is expected that uahc tn s entire tenncare population will transfer to other mcos on november  and the tenncare contract for its current medicaid business in western tennessee will expire on june  and not be extended or renewed 
uahc tn s medicare primary market competitors in western tennessee are healthspring  unison and windsor 
uahc tn primarily competes on the basis of enrollment  provider networks and other related plan features and criteria 
management believes that uahc tn is able to compete effectively with its primary medicare market competitors 
employees the company s ability to maintain its competitive position and expand its business into new markets depends  in significant part  upon the maintenance of its relationships with various existing senior officers  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified health care management professionals 
the company neither has nor intends to pursue any long term employment agreement with any of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
the total number of employees of the company at august  was compared to at august  as a result of the pending termination of the tenncare contract  management expects a substantial decrease in the total number of employees 
the company s employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit and management considers its relations with employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k annual report are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward looking statements contained in this report 
these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward looking statements in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in the following portion of this item a  the words we  us and our sometimes specifically mean and refer to our subsidiary uahc tn  when the context so indicates 
such factors potentially include  among others  the following we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our tenncare operations  which will substantially end october  the discontinuance of our tenncare contract will have material impact on our operations 
until then  legislative or regulatory actions  economic conditions or other factors that adversely affect those operations could materially reduce our revenues and profits 
for the year ended june   our tenncare operations accounted for of our total revenues 
on april   the department of finance and administration of the state of tennessee  bureau of tenncare tenncare  disclosed its decision to award new tenncare contracts to two organizations  not including our subsidiary  uahc tn  as the culmination of tenncare s selection process pursuant to its request for proposals for managed care services to be provided in the west grand region of tennessee 
consequently  revenue under this contract will be earned through october  as it is expected that uahc tn s tenncare members will transfer to other managed care organizations on november   and that uahc tn will perform its remaining contractual obligations through its tenncare contract expiration date of june  management believes that the discontinuance of the tenncare contract will have material impact on the company s operations 
reductions in funding for government healthcare programs could substantially reduce our profitability 
substantially all of the healthcare services we offer are through government sponsored programs  such as medicaid and medicare 
as a result  our profitability is dependent  in large part  on continued funding for government healthcare programs at or above current levels 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes in medicaid funding  for example  may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for medicaid  reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits 
reductions in medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our related expenses 
reductions in payments under medicare or the other programs under which we offer health and prescription drug plans could similarly reduce our profitability 
cms s risk adjustment payment system and budget neutrality factors make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments to our results of operations 
the centers for medicare medicaid services cms has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms is phasing in this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that bases a portion of the total cms reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors that include hospital inpatient diagnoses  diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings  including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits  gender  age  and medicaid eligibility 
cms requires that all managed care companies capture  collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year for reconciliation with cms s internal database 
as a result  it is difficult to predict with any certainty our future revenue or profitability 
in addition  our snp risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the payments we receive from cms and our medicare premium revenue 
payments to medicare advantage plans are also adjusted by a budget neutrality factor that congress and cms implemented in to prevent overall reductions in health plan payments while at the same time directing risk adjusted payments to plans with more chronically ill enrollees 
in general  this adjustment favorably impacted payments to medicare advantage plans 
in february  the president signed legislation that reduced federal funding for medicare advantage plans by approximately billion over five years 
among other changes  the legislation provided for an accelerated phase out of budget neutrality for risk adjusted payments made to medicare advantage plans 
these legislative changes will in general result in reduced payments to medicare advantage plans 
if we are unable to estimate incurred but not reported medical benefits expense accurately  that could affect our reported financial results 
our medical benefits expense includes estimates of medical claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
together with our internal and consulting actuaries  we estimate our medical cost liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
actual conditions could  however  differ from those assumed in the estimation process 
we continually review and update our estimation methods and the resulting reserves and make adjustments  if necessary  to medical benefits expense when the criteria used to determine ibnr change and when actual claim costs are ultimately determined 
due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions  the actual amount of medical benefits expense that we incur may be materially more than the amount of ibnr originally estimated 
if our future estimates of ibnr are inadequate  our reported results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our limited ability to estimate ibnr accurately could also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results 
our records may contain inaccurate information regarding the risk adjustment scores of our members  which could cause us to overstate or understate our revenue 
we maintain claims and encounter data that support the risk adjustment scores of our members  which partly determine the revenue we are entitled to for them 
these data are submitted to us based on medical charts and diagnosis codes prepared by providers of medical care 
inaccurate coding by medical providers and inaccurate records for new members in our plan could result in inaccurate premium revenue and risk adjustment payments  which are subject to correction or update in later periods 
payments that we receive in connection with such corrected or updated information may be reflected in financial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was earned 
we may also find that our data regarding our members risk adjustment scores  when reconciled  require that we refund a portion of the revenue that we received 
the competitive bidding process may adversely affect our profitability 
payments for local and regional medicare advantage plans are based on a competitive bidding process that may decrease the amount of premiums paid to us or cause us to increase the benefits we offer without a corresponding increase in premiums 
as a result of the competitive bidding process  in order to maintain our current level of profitability  in the future we may need to reduce benefits or charge our members an additional premium  either of which could make our health plan less attractive to members and adversely affect our membership 
we derive all of our medicare revenues from our snp operations  and legislative or regulatory actions  economic conditions or other factors that adversely affect those operations could materially reduce our revenues and profits 
because special needs plans each a snp are relatively new to medicare and to the health insurance market generally  we do not know whether we will be able to sustain our snp operation s profitability over the long term  and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
factors that could affect our snp operations include legislative  regulatory  intensity of competition  and utilization of benefit risks 
in addition  medicare beneficiaries who are dual eligibles generally are able to disenroll and choose another snp at any time  and certain medicare beneficiaries also have a limited ability to disenroll from the snp they initially select and choose a different snp 
we may not be able to retain the auto assigned members or those members who affirmatively choose our snp  and we may not be able to attract new snp members 
financial accounting for the medicare part d benefits is complex and requires difficult estimates and assumptions 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of mma provides for risk corridors designed to limit to some extent the losses snps would incur if their actual costs are higher than estimated in their bids submitted to cms 
for example  in  medicare drug plans will bear all gains and losses of up to of their expected costs and will retain of the gains or be reimbursed of the loss between and and will retain of the gain or be reimbursed of the loss in excess of 
as the risk corridors are designed to be symmetrical  a plan whose actual costs are below its expected costs is required to reimburse cms based on a methodology similar to that set forth above 
reconciliation payments for estimated upfront federal reinsurance payments  or in some cases the entire amount of reinsurance payments  for medicare beneficiaries who reach the drug benefits catastrophic threshold are made retroactively on an annual basis  which could expose plans to upfront costs in providing the benefit 
the accounting and regulatory guidance regarding the proper method of accounting for medicare part d  particularly as it relates to the timing of revenue and expense recognition  taken together with the complexity of the part d product may lead to variability in our reporting of quarter to quarter earnings related to medicare part d 
if state regulators do not approve payments by our health plan to us  our business and growth strategy could be materially impaired or we could be required to incur indebtedness to fund these strategies 
our health plan subsidiary  uahc tn  is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions it can pay to us for purposes other than to pay income taxes related to its earnings 
these laws and regulations also limit the amount of management fees uahc tn may pay to its affiliates  including our management subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc  without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
if the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiary s requests to pay dividends to us or to pay management and other fees to its affiliate  the funds available to us would be limited  which could impair our ability to implement our business and growth strategies 
we are required to comply with laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs  and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties 
regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly called hipaa  require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties  including healthcare providers  business associates and our members 
these regulations include standards for common healthcare transactions  including claims information  plan eligibility and payment information  unique identifiers for providers and employers  security  privacy  and enforcement 
we conduct our operations in an attempt to comply with all applicable hipaa requirements 
given the complexity of the hipaa regulations  the possibility that the regulations may change and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and sometimes conflicting interpretation  our ongoing ability to comply with the hipaa requirements is uncertain 
additionally  the costs of complying with any changes to the hipaa regulations may have a negative impact on our operations 
sanctions for failing to comply with the hipaa health information provisions include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including significant monetary penalties 
a failure by us to comply with state health information laws that may be more restrictive than the hipaa regulations could result in additional penalties 
if our medicare contract is not extended or is terminated  our business would be materially impaired 
we provide services to our medicare eligible members through our medicare advantage contract with cms 
the current contract term expires december  uahc tn expects to receive notice of the extension of the terms of the medicare advantage contract from cms before that date 
the contract is terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
if the contract were terminated or not extended  or if we were unable to successfully rebid or compete for the contracts  our business would be materially impaired 
because our premiums are established by contract and cannot be modified during the contract term  our profitability will likely be reduced or we could cease to be profitable if we are unable to manage our medical expenses effectively 
our snp revenue is generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per member that are established by the contract with cms for our medicare advantage plan 
if our medical expenses exceed our estimates  except in very limited circumstances or as a result of risk score adjustments for medicare member health acuity  we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under the contract during its then current term 
as a result  our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of healthcare services 
relatively small changes in our medical loss ratio can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses or to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported ibnr claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
competition in our medicare advantage service area may limit our ability to maintain or attract members  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a competitive environment subject to significant changes as a result of business consolidations  evolving medicare products  new strategic alliances and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations that compete with us for members 
our principal competitors for contracts  members and providers in our local service area include national  regional and local managed care organizations that serve medicare 
many managed care companies and other new part d plan participants have greater financial and other resources  larger enrollments  broader ranges of products and benefits  broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in the national market and our market  greater market share  larger contracting scale and lower costs than us 
our failure to maintain or attract members to our medicare advantage health plan as a result of such competition could adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure to increase our snp membership could adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure to increase our snp membership could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition to competition  factors that potentially could contribute to the loss of  or failure to attract and retain  members include negative accreditation results or loss of licenses or contracts to offer medicare advantage plans  negative publicity and news coverage relating to us or the managed healthcare industry generally  litigation or threats of litigation against us  automatic disenrollment  whether intentional or inadvertent  as a result of members choosing another plan  and our inability to market to and re enroll members who enroll with our competitors because of the new annual enrollment and lock in provisions under the mma 
a disruption in our healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
our operations and profitability are dependent in part on our ability to contract with healthcare providers and provider networks on favorable terms 
in any particular service area  healthcare providers or provider networks might refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs  disruption of benefits to our members or difficulty in meeting our regulatory or accreditation requirements 
if healthcare providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  then our ability to market products or to be profitable in our service area could be adversely affected 
our provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group 
any disruption in our provider network could result in a loss of membership or higher healthcare costs 
we rely on the accuracy of lists provided by cms regarding the eligibility of a person to participate in our plan  and any inaccuracies in those lists could cause cms to recoup premium payments from us with respect to members who are not ours  which could reduce our revenue and profitability 
premium payments that we receive from cms are based upon eligibility lists produced by federal and local governments 
from time to time  cms may require us to reimburse it for any premiums that we received from cms based on eligibility and dual eligibility lists that cms later discovers contained individuals who were not in fact residing in our service area or eligible for any government sponsored program or were eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
we may have already provided services to these individuals 
in addition to cms s potential recoupment of premiums previously paid  we also are at risk that cms might fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our profitability would be reduced as a result of such failure to receive payment from cms if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from them 
outsourced service providers may make mistakes and subject us to financial loss or legal liability 
we outsource certain of the functions associated with providing managed care and management services  including claims processing 
the service providers to whom we outsource these functions and provide data could inadvertently or incorrectly adjust  revise  omit or transmit the data in a manner that could create inaccuracies in our risk adjustment information  cause us to overstate or understate our revenue  cause us to authorize incorrect payment levels to members of our provider networks  or violate certain laws and regulations  such as hipaa 
negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or the company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations or business 
negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or the company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services  or adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain members 
we are dependent upon our executive officers  and the loss of any one or more of them and their managed care expertise could adversely affect our business 
our operations are highly dependent on the efforts of william c 
brooks  our president and chief executive officer  and certain other senior executives who have been instrumental in developing our business strategies and forging our business relationships 
the company neither has nor intends to pursue any long term employment agreement with any of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
although we believe we could replace any executive we lose  the loss of the leadership  knowledge and experience of mr 
brooks and our other executive officers could adversely affect our business 
moreover  replacing one or more of our executives may be difficult or may require an extended period of time 
we do not currently maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers 
violation of the laws and regulations applicable to us could expose us to liability  reduce our revenue and profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results 
the federal and state agencies administering the laws and regulations applicable to us have broad discretion to enforce them 
we are subject on an ongoing basis to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts  licenses and applicable laws and regulations 
an adverse review  audit or investigation could result in any of the following loss of our right to participate in the medicare program  loss of our license to act as an hmo or to otherwise provide a service  forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts  imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties  fines or other sanctions on us and our key employees  damage to our reputation in existing and potential markets  increased restrictions on marketing our products and services  and inability to obtain approval for future products and services  geographic expansions or acquisitions 
claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses 
from time to time  we are party to various litigation matters  some of which seek monetary damages 
managed care organizations may be sued directly for alleged negligence  including in connection with the credentialing of network providers or for alleged improper denials or delay of care 
in addition  our providers involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
although our network providers are independent contractors  claimants sometimes allege that a managed care organization should be held responsible for alleged provider malpractice  and some courts have permitted that theory of liability 
similar to other managed care companies  we may also be subject to other claims of our members in the ordinary course of business  including claims of improper marketing practices by our independent and employee sales agents and claims arising out of decisions to deny or restrict reimbursement for services 
we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation  and there can be no assurance that we will not incur substantial expense in defending future lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it results in a significant damage award  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage or other theories could significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance and other insurance coverage that we believe are adequate based on industry standards 
potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage and related reserves may be inadequate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
moreover  even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we might incur significant expenses and might be unable to effectively operate our business 
if we are unable or fail to properly maintain effective and secure management information systems  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  that could result in operational disruptions and other adverse consequences 
our business depends significantly on effective and secure information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  marketing and sales tracking  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical care cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis 
these information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and handle our expansion and growth 
any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems or related disaster recovery programs  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing members  difficulty in attracting new members or in implementing our growth strategies  disputes with members and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses  loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate reports  and other adverse consequences 
to the extent a failure in maintaining effective information systems occurs  we may need to contract for these services with third party management companies  which could be on less favorable terms to us and could significantly disrupt our operations and information flow 
furthermore  our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation and possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability could be adversely affected by cancellation of contracts  loss of members and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
because of our status as a public company  we are required to enhance and test our financial  internal and management control systems to meet obligations imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of we have worked and are working with our independent legal  accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems 
these areas include corporate governance  corporate control  internal audit  disclosure controls and procedures  and financial reporting and accounting systems 
consistent with the sarbanes oxley act and the rules and regulations of the sec  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting is required in this annual report on form k and the audit opinion of the company s independent registered accounting firm as to the effectiveness of our controls will be first required in connection with the company s filing of its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending june  if we are unable to timely identify  implement and conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may also uncover weaknesses or other issues with these controls that could also result in adverse investor reaction

the company provides comprehensive management and consulting services to uahc health plan of tennessee  inc uahc tn  a managed care organization mco which is a wholly owned second tier subsidiary of united american healthcare corporation 
since november  uahc tn has had a contract with the state of tennessee for the state s tenncare program  to arrange for the financing and delivery of health care services on a capitated basis to eligible medicaid beneficiaries and non medicaid individuals who lack access to private or employer sponsored health insurance or to another government health plan 
as of june   uahc tn s total tenncare enrollment was  members  compared to  at june  on april  we learned that uahc tn will cease providing managed care services as a tenncare contractor when its present tenncare contract expires 
revenue under this contract will be earned through october  as uahc tn s tenncare members are expected to transfer to other managed care organizations on november   after which uahc tn will perform its remaining contractual obligations through its tenncare contract expiration date of june  revenue under this contract represented and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
total costs related to this contract discontinuance are estimated to range between million  which includes claim processing costs  employee severance  lease termination costs and other corporate general administrative expenses beginning november through june on october   uahc tn entered into a contract with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms to act as a medicare advantage qualified organization 
the contract authorizes uahc tn to serve members enrolled in both the tennessee medicaid and medicare programs  commonly referred to as dual eligibles  specifically to offer a special needs plan snp to its eligible members in shelby county  tennessee including the city of memphis  and to operate a voluntary medicare prescription drug plan  both beginning january  the contract term is through december   after which the contract may be renewed for successive one year periods in accordance with its terms 
review of consolidated results of operations compared to uahc tn developments uahc tn s results of operations for fiscal and are best understood in the context of certain earlier events involving several of tenncare s major contracted mcos  which ceased doing business in fiscal beginning in february  march and april  uahc tn unexpectedly noticed increases in its claims payments  investigated  and found that approximately  new members added in september december represented children with special needs with medical costs over of the premiums received  and that many members transferred to uahc tn from failed mcos also had medical costs in excess of uahc tn s premiums received 
beginning in april  uahc tn wrote to tenncare seeking risk adjustments and reimbursements to compensate uahc tn for such medical expenses  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to uahc tn 
tenncare responded to its mcos situation generally and in some instances individually 
for all its contracted mcos generally  tenncare changed its reimbursement system to an administrative services only aso program for an month stabilization period july  through december   during which the mcos including uahc tn had no medical cost risk ie  no risk for medical losses  earned fixed administrative fees and were subject to increased oversight 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn  first through june   then through december   and then through june  through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare implemented a modified risk arrangement with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  under which they became at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and could receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks 
under two escrow agreements between the company and tenncare  on august  the company funded two escrow accounts held by tenncare at the state treasury 
both escrow agreements recited that tenncare did not at that time assert there had been any breach of uahc tn s tenncare contract and that the company funded the escrow accounts as a show of goodwill and good faith in working with tenncare 
the larger escrow account  which has expired  was in the original amount of  and was security for repayment to tenncare of any overpayments to uahc tn that might be determined by a state regulatory audit of all uahc tn processed claims 
uahc tn was notified in late fiscal that uahc tn may have incorrectly received an overpayment of million for medical claims as a result of a discrepancy in the pricing methodology 
in august  the company received  plus accumulated interest earnings back from the  escrow account 
in november  the remaining  account balance was paid to tenncare for claims discrepancies found in the audit by the tennessee department of commerce and insurance 
the other escrow account  in the original amount of  is security for any money damages that may be awarded to tenncare in the event of any future litigation between the parties in connection with certain pending investigations by state and federal authorities 
the escrow account will terminate days after the conclusion of such investigations  unless the parties earlier agree otherwise 
the escrow account bears interest at a rate no lower than the prevailing commercial interest rate for savings accounts at financial institutions in nashville  tennessee 
all amounts including interest earnings credited to the escrow account will belong to the company  except to the extent  if any  they are paid to tenncare to satisfy amounts determined to be owed to tenncare as provided in the escrow agreement 
in addition  based on a subsequent regulatory evaluation conducted by the tennessee department of commerce and insurance  it was determined that tenncare overpaid uahc tn million in excess of uahc tn s statutory net worth requirement as of june   based on a contractual agreement 
the company recorded a reserve in fiscal and subsequently paid this amount in fiscal these items have been reflected as provision for claims audit and other commitment on our consolidated statements of operations 
specific comparisons of to total revenues increased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in medical premiums revenues associated with uahc tn s medicare advantage snp product ma snp as well as an increase in modified risk revenue were offset by a decrease in fixed administrative fees

the company s accounting policy is to recognize mra revenues upon notification by tenncare that the revenue has been earned 
effective july   the evaluation period for the mra was changed from quarterly to annually  and the incentive bonus pool was adjusted to of administrative fee revenue 
total expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of million

the company s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  differs from the statutory rate of 
this difference was primarily related to the change in the valuation allowance and an impairment charge against goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
as a result of the pending expiration of the tenncare contract  the company increased its deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to uncertainties in its expected utilization 
net loss was million  or per basic share  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to net loss of million  or per basic share  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase in the net loss of million 
the increased net loss is principally due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal and deferred tax expense resulting from the pending expiration of the tenncare contract as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
the decrease was offset by the increase in the variable administrative fees and medicare premiums related to our ma snp

at such time  uahc tn  must continue to maintain net worth requirements of at least million as statutory reserves for its ongoing medicare operations 
uahc tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  however  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business 
beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program  which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including uahc tn 
during that period  mcos were generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earned fixed administrative fees  were not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  were subject to increased oversight  and could incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn  first through june   then through december   and then through june  through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare implemented a modified risk arrangement with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  under which they became at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and could receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks

on april  we learned that uahc tn will cease providing managed care services as a tenncare contractor when its present tenncare contract expires

management believes that the discontinuance of the tenncare contract will have a material impact on the company s operations 
in a december  private placement transaction  the company raised gross proceeds of million through the sale of  newly issued shares of its common stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors at a price of per share 
the investors also received warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share and expiring in december in addition  the company agreed to pay the co placement agents a transaction fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the uses of the net proceeds from the private placement have been principally for start up costs associated with the company s tennessee subsidiary s new medicare advantage contract with the centers for medicare medicaid services  which became effective january  the remainder was to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its future cash needs depends on a number of factors  particularly including its ability to control administrative costs related to the modified risk arrangement for the tenncare program that began july   and controlling corporate overhead costs 
on the basis of the matters discussed above  management believes at this time that the company has the ability to generate sufficient cash to adequately support its financial requirements through the next twelve months  and maintain minimum statutory net worth requirements of uahc tn

fasb enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities using fair value 
prior to the issuance of fasb  guidance for applying fair value was incorporated in several accounting pronouncements 
fasb provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
fasb also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under fasb  fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
while fasb does not add any new fair value measurements  it does change what had been current practice 
such changes include a requirement for an entity to include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities  a modification of the transaction price presumption  a prohibition on the use of block discounts when valuing large blocks of securities for broker dealers and investment companies  and a requirement to adjust the value of restricted stock for the effect of the restriction even if the restriction lapses within one year
