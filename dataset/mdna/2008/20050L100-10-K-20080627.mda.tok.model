item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this report 
in this discussion  the words company  we  our and us refer to command security corporation 
the following can be interpreted as including forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the words outlook  intend  plans  efforts  anticipates  believes  expects or words of similar import typically identify such statements 
various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements are identified at the end of this item our actual results may vary significantly from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  availability of labor  marketing success  competitive conditions and the change in economic conditions of the various markets we serve 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and accounts of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenue and expenses during the years reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as allowances for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  income tax assets and insurance reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we record revenues as services are provided to our customers 
revenues consist primarily of aviation and security services  which are typically billed at hourly rates 
these rates may vary depending on base  overtime and holiday time worked 
revenue for administrative services provided to other security companies are calculated as a percentage of the administrative service customer s revenue and are recognized when billings for the related security services are generated 
trade receivables we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of customer lists and borrowing costs that are being amortized on a straight line basis over three to ten years and goodwill which is reviewed annually for impairment 
the life assigned to customer lists acquired is based on management s estimate of the attrition rate 
the attrition rate is estimated based on historical contract longevity and management s operating experience 
we test for impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review  if sooner 
any potential impairment is evaluated based on anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and actual customer attrition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
insurance reserves general liability estimated accrued liabilities are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
workers compensation annual premiums are based on the incurred losses as determined at the end of the coverage period  subject to minimum and maximum premium 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
income taxes income taxes are based on income loss for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability asset for the estimated taxes payable recoverable in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
accounting for stock options in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
since sfas was adopted during fiscal year ended march   we could elect to adopt any of the three transitional recognition provisions 
we adopted the prospective method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaced sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we were required to adopt the provisions of sfas r effective july  and use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense in our financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after july  the adoption of sfas r resulted in a non cash charge of   and  for stock based compensation for the years ended march  and and nine months ended march   respectively 
such non cash charge would have been the same under the provisions of sfas overview we principally provide uniformed security officers and aviation services to commercial  residential  financial  industrial  aviation and governmental customers through over thirty company offices in fifteen states throughout the united states 
in conjunction with providing these services  we assume responsibility for a variety of functions  including recruiting  hiring  training and supervising all operating personnel as well as paying such personnel and providing them with uniforms  fringe benefits and workers compensation insurance 
our customer focused mission is to provide the best personalized supervision and management attention necessary to deliver timely and efficient security solutions so that our customers can operate in safe environments without disruption or loss 
technology underpins our efficiency  accuracy and dependability 
operations are handled by a refined software system that integrates scheduling  payroll and billing functions  giving customers the benefit of customized programs using the personnel best suited to the job 
in light of current world conditions  we expect that security will continue to be a key area of focus both domestically in the united states and internationally 
results of operations earnings we reported net income for the fiscal year ended march  of  the net income primarily resulted from i the continuing growth and expansion of our aviation and security services divisions including the acquisitions of security services businesses in california and maryland  ii lower workers compensation insurance costs reflecting our ongoing commitment to implement loss prevention practices in the workplace  provide safety training to our employees and reduce the frequency and severity of job related claims incurred  iii greater leveraging of our general and administrative expenses  iv a recovery related primarily to the stock that we received under our claim associated with the bankruptcy filing of northwest airlines and v an income tax benefit associated with the recognition of deferred tax assets 
partially offsetting the net income were i higher labor ratio margins for both our aviation and security services divisions due mainly to increases in wages  salaries and related taxes and benefits of our employees at rates in excess of the amount that we are willing to pass on to our customers through increased billing rates charged under our service contracts  ii the loss of document verification services to the transportation security administration tsa  as discussed below  iii increased overhead costs at john f

revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal year the increase resulted primarily from i incremental revenues of approximately  associated with the acquisitions of security services businesses in california and maryland in april and january  respectively  ii approximately  from new and existing airline customers at our terminal operations in los angeles and john f

these increases in revenues were partially offset by i the loss of revenues at seven domestic airport locations of approximately  due to a change in government regulations that requires the tsa to provide certain document verification services that we formerly provided at these airports and ii the termination in fiscal of a short term contract to provide security services to a national insurance company at multiple domestic locations  which generated revenues of approximately  in the prior year 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal year the increase is primarily due to higher revenues of approximately  in the aviation division from i new and existing airline customers at our terminal operations at john f 
kennedy international airport in new york  los angeles and san jose international airports in california and laguardia airport in new york totaling approximately  and ii new contracts that commenced in november  may and september with groups of airlines at new airport locations in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  oakland  california and seattle  washington totaling approximately  in addition  the security services division experienced higher revenues of approximately  due mainly to i the purchase of a security services business in florida of approximately  net  ii a new contract with a major medical center in new york city for approximately  and iii a short term contract with a national insurance company at multiple domestic locations of approximately  that terminated during september these increases in security service revenues were partially offset by lower revenues from i discontinuing services at our buffalo  new york location during fiscal of approximately  and ii our ft

the increase in our gross profit was partially offset by i higher labor ratio margins for both our aviation and security services divisions due mainly to increases in wages  salaries and related taxes and benefits of our employees at rates in excess of the amount that we are willing to pass on to our customers through increased billing rates charged under our service contracts  ii the loss of the tsa document verification services  as described above  iii higher overhead costs at jfk resulting from a shortage of manpower needed to meet increased demand for services  iv the absence of a short term contract to provide security services to a national insurance company at multiple domestic locations  and v the loss of service fees under our service agreement contracts that were discontinued during fiscal gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  of revenues from  of revenues for fiscal year the increase was due mainly to i expanded services with new and existing customers at jfk and laguardia airports in new york and san jose international airport in california  ii new contracts at pittsburgh  oakland and seattle tacoma international airports  iii a new contract with a major medical center as noted above  iv improved labor ratio margins in the security services division  v the purchase of a security services business in florida  vi a short term contract to provide security services to a national insurance company at multiple domestic locations  vii discontinuing services at our buffalo  new york location  viii lower state of new york payroll taxes related to the elimination of prior year reductions in federal unemployment tax credits  and ix lower workers compensation and automotive insurance costs 
we have an insurance policy covering workers compensation claims in states in which we perform services 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
charges for estimated workers compensation related losses incurred and included in cost of sales were   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the nature of our business also subjects us to claims or litigation alleging that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others 
we insure against such claims and suits through general liability policies with third party insurance companies 
such policies have limits of  per occurrence 
effective october   the policy limit was increased to  per occurrence with an additional excess umbrella policy of  on the aviation related business  as of october   we acquired a policy with a  limit per occurrence 
effective as of october   we retain the risk for the first  per occurrence on the non aviation related policy which includes airport wheelchair and electric cart operations and  on the aviation related policy  except for  for damage to aircraft and  for skycap operations 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on specific reserves in connection with existing claims as determined by third party risk management consultants and actuarial factors and the timing of reported claims 
these are all factored into estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to us 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by  to  of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  from  of revenues in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from i higher administrative payroll costs associated mainly with expanded operations  including the acquisitions noted above  and additional investment in our sales and marketing group  ii professional and related fees principally associated with settlement of employment related claims  iii facility costs  iv amortization costs associated with the acquisitions noted above  v stock compensation costs  and vi expenses associated with our a reporting  compliance and other obligations under applicable securities laws  b advertising and promotion including our participation in an annual security industry conference program and c the initial listing of our common shares on the american stock exchange 
the increases in our general and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower professional fees of approximately  related primarily to the expiration in december of our consulting agreement with giuliani security safety llc 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  from  of revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher i professional fees of approximately  related primarily to a one year consulting agreement that we entered into with giuliani security safety llc that expired in december  ii administrative payroll and related costs  and iii facility costs 
partially offsetting the increase was i lower bank service charges and ii a decrease of approximately  in non cash charges for stock based compensation costs 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared with  in fiscal the increase was due mainly to the timing and amounts of uncollectible accounts charged and or credited to expense between the current and prior year periods 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared with  in fiscal the decrease was due mainly to the absence of an additional provision for bad debts of  in fiscal related to the filing by delta air lines and northwest airlines of voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where our management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
we do not know if bad debts will increase in future periods nor does our management believe that the increase during the fiscal year ended march  compared with the same period of the prior year is necessarily indicative of a trend 
bad debt recoveries bad debt recoveries increased for the fiscal year ended march  by  to  from  in fiscal year as a result of a recovery of approximately  related primarily to the stock that we received under our claim related to the bankruptcy filing of northwest airlines 
bad debt recoveries increased for the fiscal year ended march  by  to  from  in fiscal year as a result of a recovery of approximately  related to our claim against a former service agreement customer that ceased operations in a previous year 
interest income interest income for the fiscal year ended march  principally represents interest earned on i cash balances and ii trust funds for potential future workers compensation claims 
interest income in fiscal decreased as a result of the loss of financing income from our service agreement contracts which were discontinued during fiscal and lower trust fund balances due to favorable trending for potential future workers compensation claims 
interest income for the fiscal year ended march  principally represents interest earned on i cash balances  ii trust funds for potential future workers compensation claims  and iii financing income from our service agreement customers 
interest income in fiscal year was comparable with the same period of the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  from  in fiscal year the increase is due mainly to higher average outstanding borrowings under our commercial revolving loan agreement  partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  from  in fiscal year the increase is due mainly to i higher average outstanding borrowings and an increase in the weighted average interest rate under our commercial revolving loan agreement and ii interest expense on the note payable related to our purchase of a security guard business during june equipment dispositions equipment dispositions are a result of the sale of vehicles  office equipment and security equipment at prices above or below book value 
the  gain on equipment dispositions for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to the disposition of company vehicles at amounts in excess of their respective book values 
the  loss on equipment dispositions for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to the disposition of company vehicles at amounts below their respective book values 
sale of investments the  gain on sale of investments for the fiscal year ended march  represents proceeds in excess of carrying amount for the sale of stock received under our claim related to the bankruptcy filing of united airlines 
income tax benefit income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  to  from  in fiscal year due mainly to an increase in our pre tax earnings which were offset by recognition of our deferred tax assets 
we have determined based on our expectations for the future that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize fully the net deferred tax assets at march  and income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended march  increased  to  from  in fiscal year due primarily to our recognition of a portion of our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we pay employees and administrative service customers on a weekly basis  while customers pay for services generally within days after billing by us 
in order to fund our payroll and operations  we maintain a commercial revolving loan arrangement  currently with cit group business credit  inc cit 
our principal use of short term borrowings is for carrying accounts receivable 
our short term borrowings have supported the increase in accounts receivable associated with i our ongoing expansion and organic growth  ii the october  change in a majority of delta airline s billing and payment terms from monthly invoices prepaid in advance to weekly invoices due in thirty days  and iii our acquisitions of expert security services  inc and brown security industries  inc on january  and april   respectively see note 
we will continue to use our short term borrowings to support our working capital requirements 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in our credit facilities or otherwise 
the failure by us to obtain such financing  if needed  would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cit revolving loan until march   we were parties to a financing agreement the agreement with cit that had a term of years ending december  and provided for borrowings in an amount up to of our eligible accounts receivable  but in no event more than  the agreement also provided for advances against unbilled revenue primarily monthly invoiced accounts although this benefit was offset by a reserve against all outstanding payroll checks 
the revolving loan bore interest at the prime rate  as defined in the agreement  plus per annum on the greater of i  or ii the average of the net balances owed by us to cit in the loan account at the close of each day during such month 
costs to close the loan totaled  and are being amortized over the three year life of the agreement  as extended see below 
on march   we entered into an amended and restated financing agreement with cit the amended and restated agreement  which provided for borrowings as noted above  but in no event more that  the amended and restated agreement provided for a letter of credit sub line in an aggregate amount of up to  letters of credit are subject to a two percent per annum fee on the face amount of each letter of credit 
the amended and restated agreement provided that interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate  as defined in the amended and restated agreement  plus 
if our ebitda  as defined in the amended and restated agreement  is equal to or less than  for the most recently completed fiscal quarter  otherwise  at the prime rate 
for libor loans interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate  as defined in the amended and restated agreement  plus if our ebitda is equal to or less than  for the most recently completed fiscal quarter  otherwise  at the libor rate plus 
on april   we entered into an amendment to the amended and restated agreement the amended agreement 
pursuant to the amended agreement  the aggregate line of credit was increased from  to  and we were provided with a  acquisition advance to fund the cash requirements associated with the acquisition of a security services business see note the amended agreement also provides for an extension of the maturity date of the amended agreement to december   and for reductions in fees and availability reserves and an increase in the letter of credit sub line to an aggregate amount of up to  the amended agreement provides that interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate  as defined in the amended agreement  less 
and for libor loans  interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate  as defined in the amended agreement  plus 
as of march   the interest rates were and for revolving and libor loans  respectively 
closing costs for the amended agreement totaled  including  payable to the lender  with  due at closing   due six months after closing and  due twelve months after closing  and  in legal costs incurred in connection with the transaction 
such costs are being amortized over the remaining life of the amended agreement 
at march   we had borrowed  in revolving loans   in libor loans and had a  letter of credit outstanding representing approximately of the maximum borrowing capacity under the amended agreement based on our eligible accounts receivable as defined under the amended agreement as of such date 
however  as our business grows and produces new receivables as to which no assurance can be given  up to an additional  could be available to borrow under the amended agreement 
we rely on our revolving loan from cit which contains a fixed charge covenant and various other financial and non financial covenants 
if we breach a covenant  cit has the right to immediately request the repayment in full of all borrowings under the amended agreement  unless cit waives the breach 
for the fiscal year ended march   we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended agreement 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended march   and net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities investing we finance vehicle purchases typically over three years and insurance through short term borrowings 
we have no present material commitments for capital expenditures 
financing during the fiscal year ended march   we increased our short term borrowings principally to support higher accounts receivable associated with i our ongoing expansion and organic growth  ii the october  change in a majority of delta airline s billing and payment terms from monthly invoices prepaid in advance to weekly invoices due in thirty days  and iii our acquisitions of expert security services  inc and brown security industries  inc 
on january  and april   respectively see note 
working capital working capital decreased by  to  as of march   from  as of march  we experienced checks issued in advance of deposits defined as checks drawn in advance of future deposits of  as of march   compared with  at march  cash balances and book overdrafts can fluctuate materially from day to day depending on such factors as collections  timing of billing and payroll dates  and are covered via advances from the revolving loan as checks are presented for payment 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of march  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include an agreement to purchase uniform cleaning services that is legally binding on we and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
outlook this section  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based upon current expectations 
actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements and are qualified by the section below entitled forward looking statements and part i  item a of this report entitled risk factors 
financial results future revenue will be largely dependent upon our ability to gain additional revenues in the security and aviation services divisions at acceptable margins while minimizing terminations of contracts with existing customers 
the revenues of our security services division has stabilized and has started to experience both organic and transactional growth over recent months after a reduction over the past few years as contracts with unacceptable margins were cancelled 
our current focus is on increasing revenue while our marketing and sales team and branch managers work to sell new business and retain profitable contracts 
the airline industry continues to increase its demand for services provided by us 
however  our aviation services division is continually subject to government regulation  which has adversely affected us in the past with the federalization of the pre board screening services and most recently with the ongoing federalization of the document verification process at several of our domestic airport locations 
our gross profit margin decreased during the fiscal year ended march  to of revenues compared with for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease resulted primarily from i higher labor ratio margins for both our aviation and security services divisions due mainly to increases in wages  salaries and related taxes and benefits of our employees at rates in excess of the amount that we are willing to pass on to our customers through increased billing rates charged under our service contracts  ii the loss of document verification services to the tsa  as previously discussed  iii increased overhead costs at jfk resulting from a shortage of manpower needed to meet increased demand for services  iv the absence of a short term contract to provide security services to a national insurance company at multiple domestic locations in the current year period  and v the loss of service fees associated with our service agreement contracts that were discontinued during the fiscal year ended march  partially offsetting these decreases were savings achieved through lower workers compensation expenses reflecting our on going commitment to implement loss prevention practices in the workplace  provide safety training to our employees and reduce the frequency and severity of job related claims incurred 
we are actively pursuing recouping the aforementioned higher labor and related costs  however  competitive pressures in the security and aviation services industries may prevent us from increasing our hourly billing rates on contract anniversary or renewal dates 
we expect our gross profit margins to average between and of revenue for fiscal year based on current business conditions 
management expects gross profit to remain under pressure due primarily to continued price competition 
however  management expects these effects to be moderated by continued operational efficiencies resulting from better management of our cost structures  improved workers compensation experience ratings  workflow process efficiencies associated with our newly integrated financial software system and higher contributions from our continuing new business development 
our cost reduction program is expected to reduce certain of our operating and general and administrative expenses in future periods 
additional cost reduction opportunities are being pursued as they are determined 
the aviation services division represents approximately of our total revenues and delta  at annual billings of approximately  is the largest customer of our aviation division representing  on an annual basis  approximately of the revenues from our aviation services division and of our total revenues 
due to the existing limitations under the amended agreement with cit  we are limited to borrowing against delta s accounts receivable of up to but not exceeding approximately  so long as such accounts do not remain unpaid for more than sixty days from the invoice date 
in the event of a bankruptcy by another airline customer s  our earnings and liquidity could be adversely affected to the extent of the accounts receivable with such airline s  as well as from lost future revenues if such airline s cease operations or reduce their requirements from us 
as of the close of business on june   our cash availability was approximately  which is believed to be sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future barring any increase in reserves imposed by cit 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  barring any increase in reserves imposed by cit 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in available borrowings under our existing or new credit facilities or otherwise 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
as of the date of this quarterly report and for the past several months  the financial markets generally  and the credit markets in particular  are and have been experiencing substantial turbulence and turmoil  and extreme volatility  both in the united states and  increasingly  in other markets worldwide 
the current market situation has resulted generally in substantial reductions in available loans to a broad spectrum of businesses  increased scrutiny by lenders of the credit worthiness of borrowers  more restrictive covenants imposed by lenders upon borrowers under credit and similar agreements and  in some cases  increased interest rates under commercial and other loans 
if we require additional financing at this or any other time  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available upon commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional financing when and if required by us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
safe harbor statement this section  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other sections of this annual report on form k and other reports and verbal statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain forward looking statements that are based on our assumptions  expectations and projections about us and the security industry 
these include statements regarding our expectations about revenues  our liquidity  or expenses and our continued growth  among others 
such forward looking statements by their nature involve a degree of risk and uncertainty 
we caution that a variety of factors  including but not limited to the factors described under item a  risk factors and the following  could cause business conditions and our results to differ materially from what is contained in forward looking statements changes in the rate of economic growth in the united states  changes in the financial condition of our customers  changes in regulatory environment  contract cancellations  changes in our estimates of costs  war and or terrorist attacks on facilities where services are or may be provided  outcomes of pending and future litigation  increasing competition by other companies  compliance with our loan covenants  recoverability of claims against our customers and others by us and claims by third parties against us  and changes in estimates used in our critical accounting policies 
other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the formation of these forward looking statements and the failure of such other assumptions to be realized  as well as other factors  may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control 
you should consider the areas of risk described above in connection with any forward looking statements that may be made by us 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any additional disclosures we make in proxy statements  quarterly reports on form q  annual reports on form k and current reports on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the fiscal year ended march   we did not hold a portfolio of securities instruments for either trading or speculative purposes 
periodically  we hold securities instruments for other than trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of market fluctuations 
we are exposed to market risk in connection with changes in interest rates  primarily in connection with outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit with cit  which was entered into for purposes other than trading purposes 
based on our average outstanding balances during the fiscal year ended march   a change in the prime lending rate could impact our financial position and results of operations by approximately  over the next fiscal year
