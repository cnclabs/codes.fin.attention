critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows allowance for losses on accounts receivable these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
an additional impairment in value of one percent of net accounts receivable would require an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and would result in additional expense of approximately  the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  the largest outstanding customer account balance was  and the five largest account balances totaled  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill impairment the company has approximately  of goodwill on its balance sheet related to its largest reporting unit 
the carrying value of this reporting unit is approximately  the company reviews this goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting unit that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting unit  market conditions and economic conditions 
the company analyzed various discount rates  transaction multiples and cash flows for the reporting unit 
as a result of these calculations  we determined a range of fair values of the reporting unit with related goodwill of approximately  to  we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our goodwill has been impaired 
however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair value or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations con t insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health insurance programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for and was determined based on the moody s rating on aa bonds with maturity of years and beyond 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the plans 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  and would have reduced the funded status by  for the company s defined benefit pension plans 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for federal and state jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal and state tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of approximately  in total unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january   balance of retained earnings 
as of january   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  for the year ending december   we recognized a net decrease in total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  primarily as a result of current year audits by the internal revenue service and the expiration of the statute of limitations on various outstanding tax positions

this statement revises fas  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion share based compensation expense that was recorded in and includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in those years 
in our share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars that fully vest on the date of grant 
therefore  the fair value of the options and sar s granted is recognized as expense on the date of grant 
we used the black scholes merton valuation model to value any share based compensation under fas r 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate 
the company determines the assumptions to be used based upon current economic conditions 
the impact of changing any of the individual assumptions by would not have a material impact on the recorded expense

the earliest tax year open to examination by a major taxing jurisdiction is in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  disclosure requirements for taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue producing transactions 
the consensus allows companies to choose between two acceptable alternatives based on their accounting policies for transactions in which the company collects taxes on behalf of a governmental authority  such as sales taxes 
the guidance should be applied to financial reports through retrospective application for all periods presented  if amounts are significant  for interim and annual reporting beginning after february  the company collects sales tax for various taxing authorities

upon initially obtaining control  the acquiring entity in a business combination must recognize of the fair values of the acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions even if the acquirer has not acquired of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated

contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration

the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements

because of the tentative and preliminary nature of these proposed standards  management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to the company s consolidated financial statements
