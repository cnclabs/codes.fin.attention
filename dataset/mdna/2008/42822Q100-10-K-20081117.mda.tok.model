we use the terms hewitt  the company  we  us  and our to refer to the business of hewitt associates  inc and its subsidiaries 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal years  which end on september for example  a reference to or fiscal means the twelve month period that ends september  references to and adjustments for foreign currency translation are made within our discussion of results so that the financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates used in reporting results in one currency us dollar and helps facilitate a comparative view of business results 
financial results described within this section  except for share and per share information  are stated in thousands of us dollars unless otherwise noted 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
overview hewitt made significant progress during fiscal year on executing against the four key strategic priorities established in the prior year 
we grew revenue and expanded margins while continuing to invest in our benefits outsourcing and consulting segments 
we focused on stabilizing the hr bpo business  restructuring two more contracts during the year 
we raised million from a debt offering during the fourth quarter and maintained a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity even as the broader economy endured the effects of the credit crisis and equity market volatility 
we made three strategic acquisitions to broaden our service offerings to our clients and completed our existing share repurchase authorization prior to the january  expiration date 
fiscal year net revenues  excluding third party supplier revenues and adjusting for the favorable effect of foreign currency translation of million and the net favorable effect of acquisitions divestiture of million  increased as compared to the prior year period and was driven by growth across all segments  particularly in consulting 
consulting revenue growth over the prior year  adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of million  resulted principally from retirement and financial management services as well as talent and organizational consulting services 
hr bpo reported revenue growth in the year  excluding third party revenue and adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million and the impact of million from the additional revenues generated by cyborg in the prior fiscal year 
the hr bpo revenue increase is primarily related to an increase in the number of clients who went live with contract services over the last twelve months and growth in revenue from existing clients  including an increase in project work and transactional volumes 
this was partially offset by planned service reductions to certain current and former clients 
also contributing to the increase was the benefit of million related to the resolution of two contract restructurings 
benefits outsourcing also reported higher revenue during the year  adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of million 
higher revenue related to benefits outsourcing was due to an increase in clients going live with contract services over the last twelve months  increased project work  and the benefit of million of revenue related to the resolution of two contract restructurings  partially offset by lost clients 

table of contents fiscal year operating income increased to million  from an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the improvement was primarily due to the significant non cash charges incurred in fiscal year for goodwill and asset impairment in the hr bpo segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to these charges 
revenue growth in the consulting and benefits outsourcing segments and continued improvement in the hr bpo operating results also contributed to the increase in operating income 
segment results are discussed in greater detail later in this section 
we announced three acquisitions during fiscal new bridge street consultants  one of the leading specialist compensation consultancies in the united kingdom  csi the remuneration specialists  a specialist compensation consultancy that provides data  analytics and compensation consulting solutions to organizations in australia and new zealand  and lcg  which provides an array of integrated disability  leave and absence management solutions for mid to large sized employers 
reallife hr  which was acquired in fiscal year and provides health and welfare benefits services for middle market companies  has exceeded expectations for its first year 
we also completed the sale of the cyborg business  a licensed payroll and hr software services organization  to streamline our hr outsourcing offerings 
we continue to maintain an aggressive focus on our overall cost structure and continued several productivity initiatives across our business throughout the year 
in conjunction with an ongoing review of our real estate portfolio  we announced our intention to consolidate facilities  and in some cases  exit certain properties 
accordingly  we recorded pre tax charges of million during the fiscal year 
at september   we had a total of million in long term investments  which are comprised of available for sale auction rate securities ars 
while the underlying securities generally have long term nominal maturities that exceed one year  the interest rates on these investments reset periodically in scheduled auctions generally every days 
we have the opportunity to sell these investments during such periodic auctions subject to buyer availability 
during february  issues in the global credit and capital markets led to failed auctions with respect to our ars 
during the second  third and fourth quarter  all of our outstanding ars were subject to failed auctions 
during the third and fourth quarter  million of our ars issues were called at par 
at september   our ars portfolio had a fair value of million and a par value of million 
we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our ars at september  as a result  we determined that there was a reduction in the fair value of our ars and recorded an unrealized loss of million million net of tax within other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
since the impairments in fair values have been relatively short in duration and considering the overall quality of the underlying investments and the anticipated future market for such investments  the impairment is considered to be temporary as of september  we believe that the current lack of liquidity relating to our ars investments will not materially affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
as of september   we have classified the entire ars investment balance from short term investments to long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet reflecting our inability to determine when these investments in ars will become liquid 
at september   we have determined that we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity and that the current reduction in fair value is temporary 
during fiscal year  we continued to repurchase our outstanding common shares 
during the year  we repurchased approximately million of our outstanding shares at an average price of  for a total of approximately million  completing our original million share repurchase authorization announced during the second quarter of fiscal year for further discussion of our company s results  please see our discussion of consolidated and segment results on the following page

net revenues net revenues  excluding third party supplier revenues and adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and net acquisitions divestiture of million and million  respectively  increased as compared to the prior year 
the increase in net revenues was driven by revenue growth across all segments  with consulting showing the largest increase 
consulting revenue growth  adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of million  was due to growth in retirement and financial management and talent and organizational consulting services 
hr bpo revenue growth  excluding third party revenue and adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million and the impact of million from the additional revenue generated by cyborg in the prior fiscal year  was primarily due to an increase in the number of clients who went live with contract services over the last twelve months and growth in revenue from existing clients  including an increase in project work and transactional volumes

segment results are discussed in greater detail later in this section 
compensation and related expense compensation and related expenses increased  or million 
an increase in salary costs resulted from an increase in consulting activities to support consulting demand and higher performance based compensation 
offsetting these increases were lower salary costs associated with global sourcing and other cost management efforts and a decrease in severance expense 
goodwill and asset impairment the current year impairment charge of million resulted from the write off of deferred set up costs and capitalized software associated with certain client contracts  in addition to the impairment of customer relationship intangible assets 
during the year ended september   the company evaluated certain intangible assets related to the hr bpo and benefits outsourcing segments for impairment 
this review resulted in non cash impairment charges of million including million of goodwill impairment and million of asset impairment  which included capitalized software and core technology of million  customer relationships of million and million of anticipated losses on certain contracts 
other operating expenses the decrease in other operating expense of million was primarily due to lower infrastructure costs  including decreases in depreciation and amortization expense mostly resulting from prior year asset impairment and real estate exit charges  in addition to a reduction in third party supplier costs of million 
the decrease was partially offset by higher real estate related charges 
current and prior year operating expenses include million and million  respectively  of real estate related charges primarily due to recognition of the fair value of lease vacancy obligations and lease termination charges related to exit of certain locations  and related acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and other charges in those years 
the current year decrease in other operating expenses was also offset by higher client service delivery charges  net of deferrals  of million primarily related to the increased number of clients who are live with ongoing services and the impact of two previously announced contract restructurings 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense the increase in sg a expense of million is primarily attributable to net charges related to ongoing disputes and settlements with various clients of approximately million in the current year 
additionally  million higher allowance for doubtful accounts contributed to the increase 
a million charge associated with the restructuring of an hr bpo contract and a million charge associated with the resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor were both recorded in the same prior year period  offsetting the increases noted above 
gain on sale of business on january   we sold the cyborg business  which was included in the hr bpo segment 
cyborg was acquired in and provides licensed  processed and hosted payroll software services 
the divestiture is a part of the company s continued efforts to streamline its hr outsourcing service offerings 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million during the quarter ended march  as a result of the sale 

table of contents total other income  net total other income decreased by million in the period driven by lower interest income of million  due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates as compared to the prior year period 
higher interest expense of million  resulting from higher average debt balances as compared to the prior year period  and accelerated discount amortization related to the convertible senior notes also contributed to the increase 
lower other income  net of million resulted from lower investment gains and higher gains on foreign currency transactions 
in fiscal  the company recognized gains of million related to the sale of two equity investments 
in fiscal  the company recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a cost method investment 
provision for income taxes the company s consolidated effective income tax rate is for the year ended september   as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the company reviews its expected annual effective income tax rates and makes changes on a quarterly basis as necessary based on certain factors such as changes in forecasted annual operating income  changes to the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  changes to actual or forecasted permanent book to tax differences  impacts from future tax settlements with state  federal or foreign tax authorities  or impacts from tax law changes 
each quarter  the company identifies items which are not normal and recurring in nature and treats these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the quarter in which the discrete event occurs 
due to the volatility of these factors  the company s consolidated effective income tax rate can change significantly on a quarterly basis 
the higher effective tax rate in the current period compared to the comparable prior year period is due to the mix of income across various jurisdictions and the effect of nonrecurring discrete items including prior year return to provision adjustments and interest on fin liabilities in the current period 
the prior year tax rate was impacted by non deductible goodwill impairment charges 
effective october   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fin and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
prior to october   we established contingencies for income tax when  despite the belief that our tax positions were fully supportable  we believed that it was probable that our positions would be challenged and possibly disallowed by various authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals included the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate

net revenues the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by revenue growth in the consulting segment 
revenue strength was attributed to an increased demand in consulting for retirement and financial management and talent and organizational consulting services

the increase in performance based compensation reflected an overall increase in 
table of contents the expected payout compared to the prior year due to the improvement in underlying performance in fiscal the increase in salaries and wages was primarily attributable to increases in compensation  higher labor costs related to servicing live clients  and an increase in severance expense 
partially offsetting the increase in salaries and wages was lower contractor expense due to the company s continued efforts to optimize resources 
goodwill and asset impairment during the year ended september   the company evaluated certain intangible assets related to the hr bpo and benefits outsourcing segments for impairment

during fiscal  the company recognized million of impairment charges related to hr bpo 
the non cash charges consisted of million of goodwill impairment  million of asset impairment for certain existing contracts due to higher than expected costs to be incurred over the life of the contracts  million of asset impairment resulting from the termination of a client contract and million of long lived asset impairment primarily due to lower than expected utilization of an acquired asset 
other operating expenses the decrease in other operating expense was due to a reduction in third party supplier costs of million  offset by million of real estate related charges primarily due to recognition of the fair value of lease vacancy obligations and lease termination charges related to exit of certain locations  and related acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and other charges 
also offsetting the decrease was an increase in client service delivery charges  net of deferrals  of million primarily related to the increased number of hr bpo clients who were live with ongoing services 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to a million charge associated with the anticipated restructuring of an hr bpo contract and a million charge  recorded within benefits outsourcing  associated with the resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor 
also contributing to the increase was higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from the shortening of the remaining useful life of a customer relationship and higher consulting charges related to the company s assessment of its longer term strategy 
total other income  net total other income increased by million over the prior year due to higher interest income derived from significantly higher average investment balances and rising interest rates yielding higher returns 
in addition  in fiscal  we sold an investment that was accounted for using the cost basis method of accounting and recognized a gain of million 
in fiscal  we recognized a million gain in connection with a contribution of our german retirement and financial management business in exchange for an increased investment in a german actuarial business

benefits outsourcing operating income increased compared to the prior year 
growth was mostly due to an increase from the prior year in higher margin project work  a decrease in compensation expense associated with lower severance and lower salary costs related to global sourcing  and other infrastructure cost management efforts 
this growth was partially offset by higher contractor costs and operating expense related to certain large  complex clients that went live with ongoing services  as well as higher performance based compensation and net litigation costs 
the prior year results also reflected million of additional loss reserves for anticipated losses on certain european contracts  and million resulting from the resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor 
hr bpo hr bpo net revenue  excluding third party revenue and adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million and the impact of million from the additional revenues generated by cyborg in the prior fiscal year  increased

the current year also includes net charges related to ongoing disputes and settlements with various clients of million 
consulting consulting net revenues  adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of million  increased

offsetting the decrease was revenue growth 
unallocated shared service costs unallocated shared service costs are global expenses that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and are not specific to a business segment

fiscal results included charges of million for goodwill impairment  million for anticipated losses on certain contracts  million net asset impairment from the termination of a client in the first quarter of fiscal and million for impairment of long lived assets 
excluding these fiscal and fiscal charges  the segment loss improved primarily due to the stabilization of the existing client base  as well as overall cost management efforts  offset in part by the impact of new contract implementations and increased intangible asset amortization 
consulting consulting net revenues  adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of approximately million  increased 
the majority of this growth resulted from increased demand in north america and europe for retirement and financial management consulting  in particular  driven by the new funding legislation in the us and upcoming pension accounting changes 
also contributing to the revenue growth was increased demand for talent and organizational consulting services  particularly in the asia pacific region 
segment income increased as compared to fiscal due to revenue growth  partially offset by higher compensation expense driven by increased wages and performance based incentives 
unallocated shared service costs unallocated shared service costs are global expenses that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and are not specific to a business segment 
these costs include finance  legal  management and corporate relations and other related costs 
unallocated costs increased primarily due to increased professional services related to the company s strategic initiatives and increased performance based compensation expense  offset by productivity savings resulting from restructuring activities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and this annual report 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances change  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and client contract loss reserves  deferred contract costs and revenues  performance based compensation  accounts receivable and unbilled work in process  goodwill and other intangible assets  retirement plans  income taxes  share based compensation and investments 
revenue recognition revenues include fees generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
outsourcing contract terms typically range from three to five years for benefits contracts and seven to ten years for hr bpo contracts  while consulting arrangements are generally short term in nature 
in connection with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we have contracts with multiple elements primarily in our benefits outsourcing and hr bpo segments 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  deliverables included in an arrangement are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is deferred until the period in which the final deliverable is provided or a predominant service level has been attained 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
revenue is then recognized using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis as adjusted primarily for volume changes  as appropriate 
our clients typically pay for consulting services either on a time and material or on a fixed fee basis 
on fixed fee engagements  revenues are recognized either as services are provided using a proportional performance method  which utilizes estimates of overall profitability and stages of project completion  or at the completion of the project  based on the facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
contract losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct costs  including any remaining deferred contract costs  exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
when a loss is identified  it is first recorded as an impairment of deferred contract costs related to the specific contract  if applicable  with the remaining amount recorded as a loss reserve 
estimates are monitored during the term of the contract and any changes to the estimates are recorded in the period the change is identified and may result in adjustments to the loss reserve 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues for long term outsourcing service agreements  implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company s systems and operating processes 
for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are 
table of contents deferred and amortized over the period the related ongoing services revenue is recognized 
such costs may include internal and external costs for coding or customizing systems  costs for conversion of client data and costs to negotiate contract terms 
for outsourcing services that are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation  as well as ongoing service delivery costs incurred prior to revenue recognition commencing are deferred and amortized over the remaining contract services period 
implementation fees are also generally received from our clients either up front or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant 
lump sum implementation fees received from a client are initially deferred and then recognized as revenue evenly over the contract ongoing services period 
if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract  a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings generally over the remaining service period through the termination date 
performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management subject to an annual review by the compensation and leadership committee of the board of directors 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team and total company performance 
performance based compensation is paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim reporting dates involves judgment  is based on annual results as compared to internal targets and takes into account other factors  including industry trends and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the company  team or individual 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim periods 
client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable or unbilled work in process to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due or unbilled work in process is not billed 
facts and circumstances may change  which would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in process 
a key factor mitigating this risk is our diverse client base 
for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
estimates of fair value are based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired businesses and net assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
these estimates are generally made in consultation with a third party valuation specialist 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period

the valuation of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions  which are reviewed annually 
the assumptions include rates of increases in employee compensation  interest rates used to discount liabilities  the long term rate of return on plan assets  anticipated future health care costs and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
the selection of assumptions is based on both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation 
the use of different assumptions would have resulted in different measures of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
we are not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believe our assumptions are appropriate 
please refer to note for more information on our assumptions 
the most critical assumptions pertain to the plans covering employees outside north america  as these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provisions and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
effective october   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fin and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
prior to october   we established contingencies for income tax when  despite the belief that our tax positions were fully supportable  we believed that it was probable that our positions would be challenged and could be disallowed by various authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals included the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
share based compensation our employees and directors may receive awards of nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares  performance units  and cash based awards  and employees can also receive incentive stock options 
restricted stock awards  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are measured using the fair market value of the stock as of the grant date 
the company recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis if cliff vesting or on an accelerated attribution basis if graded vesting annually over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reviewed periodically and changes to the estimated forfeiture rate are adjusted through current period earnings 
employer payroll taxes are also recorded as expense when they become due over the vesting period 
the remaining unvested shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on sale or transfer  generally for four years from the grant date 

table of contents the company also grants nonqualified stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company s stock on the grant date 
the company applies the black scholes valuation method to compute the estimated fair value of the stock options and recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis so that the award is fully expensed at the vesting date 
generally  stock options vest percent on each anniversary of the grant date  are fully vested four years from the grant date and have a term of ten years 
the company uses the simplified method  defined in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 to determine the expected life assumption for all of its options 
the company continues to use the simplified method  as permitted by sab no 
 as it does not believe that it has sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life due to the limited time its equity shares have been publicly traded 
investments short term and long term investments include marketable equity and debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
marketable debt securities include auction rate securities ars which generally have long term nominal maturities that exceed one year  with interest rates that reset periodically in scheduled auctions generally every days 
unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent they are considered temporary 
realized gains or losses and other than temporary unrealized losses are reported in other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
at september   the company s auction rate securities are classified as long term investments because the auctions have failed
