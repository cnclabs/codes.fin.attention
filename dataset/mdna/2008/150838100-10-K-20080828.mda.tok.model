item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent results and fiscal year end financial condition for the fiscal year ended june   total revenue increased  to million from million during fiscal freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased  to million in fiscal from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for we believe that a weakened freight market and increased industry wide trucking capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as a sharp increase in fuel prices  were the major factors that contributed to our decrease in net income 
decreased freight demand due to a slower economy caused a decrease in truck utilization measured by miles per tractor 
in addition  shippers used the less robust freight market to resist rate increases and  in some cases  attempted to reduce freight rates 
the downward pressure on our rates was somewhat offset by a decrease in average length of haul 
as a result  average freight revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge for decreased per mile to  a decrease compared with per mile for average freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  decreased by to  in compared with  for this decrease was due to lower general freight demand and an increase in non revenue miles  offset by a decrease in fleet size to  tractors at june  from  tractors at june  as the freight market weakened and we ran more empty miles to get to our next load and position equipment for sale  our non revenue miles increased 
our operating ratio  excluding the effect of fuel surcharge  increased to for compared with for at june   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
at june   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  other trucking related services  and from truckersbb 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we eliminate fuel surcharges from revenue  when calculating operating ratios and some of our operating data 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel and facilities expenses 
in discussing our expenses as a percentage of revenue  we sometimes discuss changes as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharges  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 

table of contents the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past three years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy has slowed down  many trucking companies have been forced to lower freight rates to keep their trucks moving 
over the long term  we expect a limited pool of qualified drivers and intense competition to recruit and retain those drivers to constrain overall industry capacity 
assuming a return to economic growth in us manufacturing  retail  and other high volume shipping industries  we expect to be able to raise freight rates in line with or faster than costs 
over the near term this may prove challenging in the current freight environment 
revenue equipment we operate  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors at june    were owned   were acquired under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers at june    were owned and  were acquired under operating and capital leases 
prior to fiscal  we had financed most of our new tractors under operating leases 
beginning in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we have purchased most of our new tractors with cash or borrowings 
we expect to continue to use cash and borrowings on our credit facility for most tractor purchases 
most of our new trailers are acquired with operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of seven years for trailers 
when we finance revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than borrowings or capital leases  the interest component of our financing activities is recorded as an above the line operating expense on our statements of operations 
accordingly  the trend toward financing more equipment with cash and borrowings  and less through operating leases  improves our operating ratio 
independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractors 
the payments to independent contractors are recorded in purchased transportation and the payments for equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and through operating leases effectively shifts these expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using our operating ratio as well as income before income taxes 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to achieve an operating ratio of approximately 
we expect this to require additional improvements in rate per mile  non revenue miles percentage  and miles per tractor compared with those key performance indicators for fiscal  to overcome expected additional cost increases 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile and non revenue miles percentage affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for fiscal  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effect on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment particularly in light of the and epa engine requirements  our fuel costs  and our insurance and claims 
to overcome cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve increases in freight revenue per tractor  particularly in revenue per mile  which we intend to achieve by increasing rates and continuing to shift to more profitable freight 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety and driver recruiting and retention 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 
given the difficult freight market confronting our industry  we believe achieving our profitability goal during fiscal is unlikely  although we intend to continue to strive toward that goal 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating and freight revenue for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue is total operating revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase resulted from the continuation of our efforts to eliminate the least favorable freight from our system and the growth of customer relationships from our prior year acquisitions  which more than offset softer freight demand generally 
the increase was attributable to an increase in billed miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
the reduction in average freight revenue per total mile resulted primarily from an increase in non revenue miles 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  decreased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of lower general freight demand and an increase in non revenue miles 
the decrease in miles per tractor and an increase in non revenue mile percentage were attributable to less freight demand 
revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was related to a decrease in tractor and trailer rebate revenue  partially due to the discontinuance of the trailer incentive program  and decreases in the fuel rebates due to small and mid size carriers being adversely affected by weak freight demand 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were primarily due to increased driver payroll  resulting from a increase in company miles 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were due to an increase of in company miles  an increase in non revenue miles and an increase in average fuel prices of approximately per gallon 
in addition  we began to experience lower fuel economy and higher costs of fuel from the installation of epa mandated new engines and use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
higher fuel prices and lower fuel economy will increase our operating expenses to the extent we cannot offset them with surcharges 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  and tire expense 
this category increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases are primarily related to an increase in costs associated with various direct expenses such as toll expense  border drayage expense  and scales expense and an increase in physical damage expense  due to increased accidents 
insurance and claims expense was million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal insurance and claims increased as a percentage of freight revenue due to increased number of claims  increased claim dollars  increased number of workers compensation claims  and increased dollar of workers compensation claims 
our insurance expense consists of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
insurance and claims expense will vary based primarily on the frequency and severity of claims  the level of self retention  and the premium expense 

table of contents depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases are related to the conversion of operating leases to capital leases related to approximately  trailers  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting from the company declaring its intent to purchase certain trailers previously financed with operating leases 
the conversion of the trailer leases resulted in a simultaneous decrease in our revenue equipment rentals 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
in addition  we have continued to purchase tractors with cash and borrowings  which has increased our tractor depreciation 
in the near term we expect to purchase new tractors primarily with cash or finance new trailers with operating leases 
accordingly  going forward we expect depreciation and amortization will increase as a percentage of freight revenue and revenue equipment rentals will decrease as a percentage of freight revenue as increased depreciation expense associated with tractors acquired with cash or borrowings will more than offset decreased depreciation resulting from financing new trailer acquisitions with operating leases 
revenue equipment rentals were million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to a decrease in our tractor fleet financed under operating leases as discussed under depreciation and amortization 
at june    tractors  or of our company tractors  were held under operating leases  compared to  tractors  or of our company tractors  at june  given the level of new tractors expected to be purchased with cash or borrowings and new trailers expected to be financed under operating leases  we expect revenue equipment rentals will continue to decrease going forward 
purchased transportation increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases are primarily related to increases in our third party carrier expense and warehousing expenses  related to an effort to grow these portions of our business 
our independent contractor expense was largely unchanged as a percentage of freight revenue between fiscal and fiscal  as a decrease in independent contractors to at june   from at june   was offset by increased fuel surcharge reimbursement 
the challenging freight environment has had a negative impact on independent contractors  who are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  decreased to of freight revenue for fiscal from for fiscal in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
the higher canadian dollar  which increased to a 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  from a 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately 
income taxes decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  due to lower pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate  in future periods as net income fluctuates 
as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal 
table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was partially attributable to growth of our tractor fleet through the acquisition of digby in october  warrior in february  and air road in june the addition of tractors  drivers  and customer relationships from these acquisitions more than offset softer freight demand generally and the continuation of our efforts to eliminate the least favorable freight from our system 
the increase was helped by a improvement in average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
the improvement in average freight revenue per total mile resulted primarily from a decrease in the percentage of our freight comprised of automotive parts and a corresponding increase in the percentage of our freight comprised of consumer non durables 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  decreased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of lower general freight demand  an increase of our tractor fleet to  at june   from  at june   and an increase in non revenue miles 
the decrease in miles per tractor and an increase in non revenue mile percentage were attributable to less freight demand 
revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the truckersbb revenue increase resulted from an increase in member usage of the tire discount programs in addition to an increase in total fleets using the programs 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal in fiscal  we experienced an increase in our salaries  wages  and benefits as a percentage of freight revenue due to increased company miles  which increased driver wages  and increased stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense in fiscal  although partially offset by a increase in company miles  which in turn increased driver wages  resulted in this category returning to historical levels 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were due to an increase of in company miles and an increase in average fuel prices of approximately per gallon 
in addition  we began to experience lower fuel economy and higher costs of fuel from the installation of epa mandated new engines and use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  and tire expense 
this category increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were due to an increase in the size of our tractor fleet  an increase in costs associated with accident repair and various direct expenses such as toll expense  cargo handling expense  and increased expenses related to harsh weather 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in our maintenance costs attributable to a younger tractor fleet 
insurance and claims expense was million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal insurance and claims expense varies based primarily on the frequency and severity of claims  the level of our self insured retention  and our premium expense 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases can be attributed to the addition of tractors purchased with cash and borrowings and the conversion of operating leases to capital leases related to approximately  trailers 
the remaining increase in this expense category was attributable to the acquisition of certain assets of digby in october  warrior in february  and air road in june in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company declared its intent to purchase certain trailers previously financed with operating leases  resulting in a change from operating to capital lease classification 
the conversion of the trailer leases also resulted in a decrease in our revenue equipment rentals in fiscal 
table of contents revenue equipment rentals were million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to a decrease in our tractor and trailer fleet financed under operating leases as discussed under depreciation and amortization 
as of june   we had financed  tractors and  trailers under operating leases  as compared to  tractors and  trailers as of june purchased transportation increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the increase in the overall dollar amount was primarily related to increased independent contractor expense  as the number of independent contractors increased by to at june   from at june  this increase was partially due to increased payments to independent contractors resulting from fuel surcharges collected due to rising fuel costs  which are passed through to our independent contractors on a per mile basis 
the number of independent contractors grew in fiscal as the company partnered with several financing companies to make it easier for drivers to purchase trucks 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources trucking is a capital intensive business 
we require cash to fund our operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization  to make capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to repay debt  including principal and interest payments 
other than ordinary operating expenses  we anticipate that capital expenditures for the acquisition of revenue equipment will constitute our primary cash requirement over the next twelve months 
we frequently consider potential acquisitions  and if we were to consummate an acquisition  our cash requirements would increase and we may have to modify our expected financing sources for the purchase of tractors 
subject to any required lender approval  we may make acquisitions  although we do not have any specific acquisition plans at this time 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  bank borrowings  capital and operating lease financing of revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment 
as of june   we had on order  tractors and trailers for delivery through fiscal these revenue equipment orders represent a capital commitment of approximately million  before considering the proceeds of equipment dispositions 
in fiscal  we purchased the majority of our new tractors with cash or borrowings  and we acquired most of the new trailers under off balance sheet operating leases 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we also declared our intent to purchase approximately  trailers at the end of the respective lease term  resulting in a change from operating lease to capital lease classification 
at june  our total balance sheet debt  including capital lease obligations and current maturities  was million  compared to million at june   and million at june  our debt to capitalization ratio total balance sheet debt as a percentage of total balance sheet debt plus total stockholders equity was at june   at june   and at june  we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses  as well as our current commitments for the acquisition of revenue equipment  over the next twelve months with a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings available under secured equipment financing or our primary credit facility  equipment sales  and lease financing arrangements 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  and the availability of the needed capital will depend upon our financial condition and operating results and numerous other factors over which we have limited or no control  including prevailing market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
however  based on our operating results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  and sources of equipment lease financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 

table of contents cash flows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to lower earnings  the increase of trade receivables  income tax recoverable  and prepaid expenses and other current assets  offset by the increase of depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the decrease in cash used for investing activities from to was primarily due to the million of cash used to purchase digby in october  warrior in february  and air road in june cash used in investing activities includes the net cash effect of acquisitions and dispositions of revenue equipment during each year 
capital expenditures primarily for tractors and trailers including lease buyouts and new equipment purchases totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  excluding the assets purchased from digby  warrior  and air road  and million in fiscal we generated proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in cash used was primarily due to the repurchase of million of the company s common stock between october and december pursuant to the company s publicly announced stock repurchase program 
financing activity represents bank borrowings new borrowings  net of repayments and payment of the principal component of capital lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
our operating leases include some under which we do not guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term walk away leases and some under which we do guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term residual value 
therefore  we are subject to the risk that equipment value may decline in which case we would suffer a loss upon disposition and be required to make cash payments because of the residual value guarantees 
we were obligated for residual value guarantees related to operating leases of million at june  compared to million at june  a small portion of these amounts is covered by repurchase and or trade agreements we have with the equipment manufacturer 
we believe that any residual payment obligations that are not covered by the manufacturer will be satisfied  in the aggregate  by the value of the related equipment at the end of the lease 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we anticipate that going forward we will use cash generated from operations to finance tractor purchases and operating leases to finance trailer purchases 
prior to fiscal  we financed most of our new tractors and trailers under operating leases  which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
in fiscal  we began purchasing most of our new tractors using cash and borrowings under our credit facility  while still financing our new trailers with operating leases 
the use of operating leases also affects our statement of cash flows 
for assets subject to these operating leases  we do not record depreciation as an increase to net cash provided by operations  nor do we record any entry with respect to investing activities or financing activities 
primary credit agreement on september   celadon group  inc  celadon trucking services  inc  and truckersbb entered into an unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement with lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent  and lasalle bank national association  fifth third bank central indiana  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as lenders 
the credit agreement was amended on december   by the first amendment to credit agreement  pursuant to which celadon logistics services  inc was added as a borrower to the credit agreement 
the credit agreement  as amended by the third amendment on january   matures on january  the credit agreement is intended to provide for ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement are based  at the option of the company  on a base rate equal to the greater of the federal funds rate plus and the administrative agent s prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on cash flow coverage 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by celadon e commerce  inc  celadon canada  inc  and jaguar  each of which is a subsidiary of the company 

table of contents the credit agreement  as amended by the third amendment  has a maximum revolving borrowing limit of million  and the company may increase the revolving borrowing limit by an additional million  to a total of million 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million and a swing line facility has a limit of million 
a commitment fee that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants at june   and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
at june   million of our credit facility was utilized as outstanding borrowings and million was utilized for standby letters of credit 
contractual obligations and commitments as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts  and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows cash requirements as of june  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases lease residual value guarantees capital lease obligations long term debt sub total future purchase of revenue equipment employment and consulting agreements standby letters of credit total contractual and cash obligations includes interest 
the amounts reflected in the table do not include amounts that could become payable to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  under certain circumstances if their employment by the company is terminated 
inflation many of our operating expenses  including fuel costs and revenue equipment  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which result in higher operating costs and reduced operating income 
the effects of inflation on our business during the past three years were most significant in fuel 
we have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and fuel surcharges 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following 
table of contents depreciation of property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally use estimated useful lives of to years for new tractors and trailers  and estimated salvage values for new tractors and trailers generally range from to of the capitalized cost 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised or estimated market value of the asset  as appropriate 
operating leases 
we have financed a substantial percentage of our tractors and trailers with operating leases 
these leases generally contain residual value guarantees  which provide that the value of equipment returned to the lessor at the end of the lease term will be no lower than a negotiated amount 
to the extent that the value of the equipment is below the negotiated amount  we are liable to the lessor for the shortage at the expiration of the lease 
for all equipment  we are required to recognize additional rental expense to the extent we believe the fair market value at the lease termination will be less than our obligation to the lessor 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  property and equipment held under operating leases  and liabilities related thereto  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
all expenses related to revenue equipment operating leases are reflected on our statements of operations in the line item entitled revenue equipment rentals 
as such  financing revenue equipment with operating leases instead of bank borrowings or capital leases effectively moves the interest component of the financing arrangement into operating expenses on our statements of operations 
claims reserves and estimates 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of these self insurance amounts 
claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims  including adverse development of reported claims  as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators  and we refer to these estimates in establishing our reserves 
claims incurred but not reported are estimated based on our historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care  and in general interest rates  legal expenses  and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
however  should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations when it becomes effective 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
 which provides a one year delayed application of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the company must adopt these new requirements no later than its first quarter of fiscal in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred

in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk principally from our primary credit facility 
the credit facility carries a maximum variable interest rate of either the bank s base rate or libor plus 
at june   the interest rate for revolving borrowings under our credit facility was libor plus 
at june   we had million variable rate term loan borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
a hypothetical increase in the bank s base rate and libor would be immaterial to our net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  specifically in connection with our canadian operations 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our canadian operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in canadian dollars  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from canada 
as a result  increases in the canadian dollar exchange rate adversely affect the profitability of our canadian operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our canadian operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  as of june   we had none of our currency exposure hedged 
we generally do not face the same magnitude of foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our intra mexico operations conducted through our mexican subsidiary  jaguar  because our foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to our foreign currency expenses for those operations 
for purposes of consolidation  however  the operating results earned by our subsidiaries  including jaguar  in foreign currencies are converted into united states dollars 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our mexican operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a decrease in the mexican peso exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political  and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
as of june   we had none of our estimated fuel purchases hedged
