item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reinsurance 
for at least of our  of reinsurance recoverables at december   we are protected from the credit risk by using various types of risk mitigation mechanisms such as trusts  letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement 
for example  reserves of  and  as of december  relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with the hartford and john hancock  respectively  related to sales of businesses 
if the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities  the hartford and john hancock  as the case may be  will be required to put more assets in the trusts 
we may be dependent on the financial condition of the hartford and john hancock  whose am best ratings are currently a and a  respectively 
for recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms  we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer 
occasionally  the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable 
see item a risk factors risks related to our company reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses  and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers 
we believe that a majority of our remaining reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated a or better by am best 
inflation risk inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets  which are not indexed to the level of inflation  whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation 
approximately of assurant preneed s insurance policies with reserves of approximately  as of december  have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the cpi 
in times of rapidly rising inflation  the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in 
table of contents an adverse impact on earnings 
we have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing contracts with payments tied to the cpi 
see derivatives 
in addition  we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation  and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in canada 
we also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the canadian dollar  primarily the british pound and danish krone 
however  total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than of our total invested assets at december  foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency 
we have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
the foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets denominated in canadian dollars on our entire fixed maturity portfolio is summarized in the following table foreign exchange movement analysis of market value of fixed maturity securities assets as of december  foreign exchange spot rate at december   us dollar to canadian dollar total market value change of market value from base case change of market value from base case the foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our consolidated net income is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume earnings in canadian dollars are recognized evenly throughout a period 
our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology

table of contents derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments 
we have purchased contracts to cap the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our preneed insurance policies 
in  we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with the hartford contained an embedded derivative 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s derivatives implementation group statement implementation issue no 
 embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments dig b  we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative total return swap and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet 
contemporaneous with adoption of dig b  we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities  included in other investments 
the combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented
