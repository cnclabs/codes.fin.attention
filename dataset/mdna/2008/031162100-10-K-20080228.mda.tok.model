overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of amgen inc  including its subsidiaries referred to as amgen  the company  we  our and us 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we are a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
as a science based  patient focused organization  we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  nephrology and inflammation 
our principal products include aranesp  epogen  neulasta neupogen and enbrel all of which are sold in the united states 
enbrel is marketed under a co promotion agreement with wyeth in the united states and canada 
our international product sales consist principally of european sales of aranesp and neulasta neupogen 
for additional information about our principal products  their approved indications and where they are marketed  see item business principal products 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and various us and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries 
government authorities in the united states and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing r d activities 
for example  prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a product  we must conduct extensive clinical studies designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for use in humans in the indications sought 
furthermore  in order to maintain regulatory approval to market a product  we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and to provide additional information on safety and effectiveness 
the regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies  in particular the fda  to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products 
for example  on september   president bush signed into law the fdaaa  significantly adding to the fda s authority see item business government regulation 

table of contents most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government and or private payer health care programs 
the reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment 
for example  failure to demonstrate a clear economic value associated with the use of a new therapeutic product as compared to existing therapeutic products or practices may result in reduced reimbursement 
therefore  sales of our products are and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers  including government and private insurance plans and administration of those programs 
governments may regulate access to  prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products 
worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures 
further  safety signals or adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others including our licensees or independent investigators or from the marketed use of our drugs may expand safety labeling or restrict the use for our approved products and may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products 
for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see item business reimbursement 
for the year ended december   total revenues were billion and net income was billion  or per share on a diluted basis 
in addition to the factors noted in item business key developments  our results of operations for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by the write off of million of acquired ipr d related to the acquisitions of alantos and ilypsa and charges of million in connection with our previously announced restructuring plan 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  of which approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations 
if these funds are repatriated for use in our us operations  we would be required to pay additional us and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates 
our total debt outstanding was billion as of december  our product sales for the year ended december  were billion representing an increase of million  or  over product sales for the year ended december  this increase reflects growth primarily in enbrel and neulasta neupogen significantly offset by a decline in aranesp 
the decline in sales of aranesp  in particular aranesp sales in the us supportive cancer care segment  reflects a decrease in demand resulting from various regulatory and reimbursement developments in  as discussed below 
international product sales in represented of total product sales and consisted principally of european sales of aranesp  neulasta and neupogen 
international product sales grew in to billion  principally driven by sales of neulasta neupogen and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international product sales growth during was favorably impacted by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated  in part  by the natural  opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income 
as such  the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated 
as discussed in more detail in item business key developments  certain of our products  principally our marketed esa products  face various challenges primarily arising from regulatory and reimbursement developments that began in the developments impacting our marketed esa products include revisions to product labels to reflect adverse safety results in various clinical studies involving esa products performed by us and others and the loss of or significant restrictions on reimbursements 
furthermore  our esa products continue to face future challenges  including the potential for further revisions to product labels and changes to reimbursement 
these developments have had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our esa marketed products  in particular aranesp sales in the us supportive cancer care segment 
in addition  increased competition  including additional approved indications for existing products  has and will continue to present challenges to certain of our products 

table of contents as a result of the above developments  in particular the regulatory and reimbursement changes that began in involving esa products  and their resulting impact on our operations  on august   we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant r d investments and build the framework for our future growth 
in connection with the implementation of our restructuring plan  we currently estimate that we will incur million to million of restructuring charges 
included in such amounts are i severance related costs of million to million with respect to staff reductions  aggregating approximately  to  positions or approximately to of our worldwide staff  ii asset related charges of million to million primarily consisting of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation resulting from rationalizing our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet future commercial and clinical demand for our products and product candidates and  to a lesser degree  changes to certain r d capital projects and iii other costs of million to million  principally related to the accrual of losses for leases for certain r d facilities that will not be used in our operations 
during the year ended december   we completed the majority of the above noted actions and incurred million of restructuring costs 
we expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions  discussed above  will be completed and the related estimated costs incurred in in connection with our efforts to improve our cost structure  we refocused our spending on critical r d and operational priorities and sought greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business  including optimizing ongoing clinical trials and trial initiation 
these efforts will assist in allowing us to provide continued support of key activities including i current and future postmarketing studies  including those with respect to our esa products  aranesp and epogen  ii regulatory affairs  safety and compliance functions  iii clinical studies to advance our late stage pipeline  iv the advancement of earlier stage compounds and v research efforts in the core areas of oncology  inflammation  bone and metabolic disorders 
in order to continue advancing our expanding pipeline of product candidates and to assist in ensuring that patients around the world are able to benefit from our future products  we are also seeking partners to assist in the development of selected product candidates in our pipeline in certain countries and or worldwide 
for example  in july we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with daiichi sankyo  which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize denosumab in japan in pmo and oncology with the potential for additional indications 
in february  we entered into a license agreement with takeda  which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the japanese market up to early to mid stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas  including oncology and inflammation 
the molecules covered by the license agreement primarily include amg  amg  amg  amg  amg and vectibix panitumumab 
amgen has the right to participate in the promotion of these products in japan 
in addition  we entered into a collaboration agreement with takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib diphosphate amg 
each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib diphosphate in the other party s territory 
in connection with these agreements  takeda has agreed to acquire our subsidiary in japan  amgen kk on july   we completed our acquisition of alantos  which was accounted for as a business combination 
alantos was a privately held company that specialized in the development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory diseases 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid cash of approximately million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of alantos 
the transaction provides amgen with alantos lead drug candidate  a dpp iv inhibitor in clinical development phase a for the treatment of type ii diabetes 
on july   we completed our acquisition of ilypsa  which was accounted for as a business combination 
ilypsa was a privately held company that specialized in the development of non absorbed drugs for renal disorders 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid cash of approximately million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ilypsa 
the transaction provides amgen with ilypsa s lead drug candidate  a phosphate binder in clinical development phase for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ckd patients on hemodialysis 

table of contents there are many economic and industry wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely  including  among others  those relating to increased complexity and cost of r d due  in part  to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies and or safety related label changes for approved products  increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates  reimbursement changes  healthcare provider prescribing behavior  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  complex and expanding regulatory requirements  and intellectual property protection

see item business principal products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
sales growth in was principally driven by enbrel and neulasta sales  which was substantially offset by a decline in aranesp sales 
in particular for the year ended december   us aranesp sales declined  primarily reflecting a decrease in demand resulting from recent regulatory and reimbursement developments as discussed in more detail below 
sales growth in was principally driven by demand for aranesp  neulasta and enbrel  which benefited from share gains and or market growth

table of contents aranesp for the years ended december   and  total aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change aranesp us aranesp international total aranesp the decrease in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by a decline in demand 
this decline primarily reflects physician conformance to label and reimbursement changes that occurred throughout  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting and  to a lesser extent  a decline in our segment share 
given the timing of these label and reimbursement changes  their impact was primarily realized in the second half of  with us aranesp sales experiencing a decrease of compared to the second half of during the latter part of the three months ended december   aranesp sales began to stabilize within a reasonable range as physicians incorporated into their anemia management approaches the new labels and reimbursement changes 
in particular  these developments  which are discussed in more detail in item business key developments  include the decision memorandum issued by cms on july   which significantly restricts medicare reimbursement for use of aranesp in cia and which we believe has also negatively impacted aranesp use in cia for patients covered by private insurance plans 
in addition  these developments include a significant decline in aranesp use in aoc throughout and the esa product label changes in the united states  which occurred on march  and november  the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international aranesp sales for the year ended december  increased 
international sales were negatively impacted in europe by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all esas 
through december   biosimilars and other recently introduced marketed products in europe have not had a significant impact on aranesp sales 
the increase in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by demand reflecting segment growth and share gains 
the growth in us aranesp sales also reflects increased aranesp usage in us hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from epogen  which we believe stabilized in mid the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was also principally driven by demand 
in addition to the factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future worldwide aranesp sales will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement developments including cms decision memorandum issued on july  which significantly restricts medicare reimbursement for the use of aranesp in cia and any related impact on private payers reimbursement or healthcare providers prescribing behavior  reimbursement changes resulting from current or future product label changes  reimbursement and cost containment pressures by third party payers  including governments and private insurance plans  regulatory developments  including product label changes occurring on november  and march  in the united states for the class of esas  including aranesp and epogen  pending product label changes in the united states for the class of esas  including aranesp and epogen  as a result of discussions with the fda regarding safety data from the prepare and gog studies and the submission of a pas in december that addressed questions raised at the may  odac meeting

epogen for the years ended december   and  total epogen sales were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change epogen us the decline in epogen sales for the year ended december  reflects a decrease in demand due to a decline in dose utilization  partially offset by patient population growth of 
the decline in dose utilization is due to physician behavior in making treatment and dosing decisions in response to regulatory and reimbursement developments  that occurred throughout as discussed in more detail in item business key developments  these developments include the issuance by the nkf of the final kdoqi guidelines  the march  and november  esa product label changes and the anticipation of cms announced revisions to its emp  effective january  the decline in sales for the year ended december  was partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventory and spillover see note  summary of significant accounting policies product sales to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the company expects excess capacity charges to continue to occur through due principally to declining product sales and related demand for aranesp resulting from regulatory and reimbursement developments 
included in costs of sales for the year ended december  are restructuring charges of million  primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate the closure of one of our enbrel commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities 
see note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  cost of sales for the year ended december  includes a million write off of excess inventory related to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments 
cost of sales increased for the year ended december   primarily due to lower royalties and a more favorable product mix and cost efficiencies at our factories 
royalty expenses were lower due to the expiration of certain contractual royalty obligations on neulasta and neupogen sales and the acquisition of certain royalty rights on sales of enbrel and eu neulasta and neupogen sales 
research and development r d expenses are primarily comprised of costs and expenses for salaries and benefits associated with r d personnel  overhead and occupancy  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing  including contract services and other outside costs  process development  quality assurance  information systems and amortization of acquired technology used in r d with alternative future uses 
r d expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners and cost recoveries from collaboration partners 
r d expenses decreased for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to reductions in in licensing expenses of approximately million primarily due to our agreement with cytokinetics entered into in and a million benefit in from third party collaborations primarily with respect to out licensing denosumab in japan to daiichi sankyo 
these decreases in r d expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by million of restructuring costs  comprised of million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock based compensation awards  which were forfeited as a result of the employees termination 
see note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in  r d expenses increased over the prior year  primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late stage programs  which included denosumab  our late stage investigational product for pmo and bone metastasis  and the continued expansion of our research and pre clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic 
in addition  r d for the year ended december   includes approximately million in non cash amortization expense for the intangible asset  xenomouse technology  acquired in the abgenix acquisition

in  we wrote off billion of acquired ipr d related to the abgenix acquisition and million of acquired ipr d in connection with the avidia acquisition 
the abgenix ipr d amount is primarily comprised of approximately million related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and approximately million related to a royalty that we would have owed to abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of abgenix s patented technology in the development of this product candidate 
panitumumab was abgenix s fully human monoclonal antibody which  at acquisition  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer 
denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling and was in phase clinical trials for various types of bone diseases at the time of the abgenix acquisition 
there were no individually significant ipr d projects acquired and written off in the acquisition of avidia 
we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired ipr d  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of for the alantos product candidate  for the ilypsa product candidate  and to for the abgenix product candidates 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the alantos and ilypsa product candidates are immaterial 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately million and would be incurred 
table of contents through the elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring any incremental r d expenses 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials  our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs 
we are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals  and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr d may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition 
at the date of acquisition  we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer 
panitumumab received fda approval in late september for the treatment of mcrc after disease progression on  or following  fluoropyrimidine  oxaliplatin and irinotecan containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark vectibix 
in december  the european commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for vectibix as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing mcrc with non mutated wild type kras genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens 
we are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop vectibix in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition 
however  since the acquisition  there have been several events that have affected the development plans for vectibix  such as the results of our pacce trial and kras biomarker analysis discussed in item business key developments 
because of these developments  our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed compared to our original expectations 
our development efforts with respect to denosumab are continuing 
in addition  we are continuing to develop the product candidates acquired in the alantos and ilypsa acquisitions 
other items primarily certain restructuring costs in as discussed in note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements  on august   we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant r d investments and build the framework for our future growth 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded in other items primarily certain restructuring costs in charges for staff separation costs of million  asset impairments of million and other charges of million primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain r d facilities that will not be used in our business 
also in  the company recorded in other items primarily certain restructuring costs in a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of million 
in  other items primarily certain restructuring costs in consisted of a million charge  net of amounts previously accrued  for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for as compared to was primarily due to the lesser amount of the write off of nondeductible acquired ipr d costs in than and the greater tax benefit from the favorable resolutions of our prior years income tax examinations in than our effective tax rate for increased over primarily due to the write off of non deductible acquired ipr d costs in connection with the acquisitions of abgenix and avidia 
the increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states  the absence of tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in under the american jobs creation act and favorable audit settlements

sfas 
these standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements  including capitalizing at the acquisition date the fair value of acquired ipr d  and remeasuring and writing down these assets  if necessary  in subsequent periods during their development 
these new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after january   except that presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas regarding noncontrolling interests shall be applied retrospectively

sfas defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition  measurement and classification in our consolidated financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for tax benefits to be recognized under fin  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
there was no cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions upon adoption of fin fin also provides guidance on the balance sheet classification of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits utbs as either current or non current depending on the expected timing of payments 
upon adoption of fin  we reclassified approximately million of utbs and related accrued interest from current income taxes payable to other non current liabilities 
interest and penalties related to utbs are classified as a component of our provision for income taxes 
see note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in august  the fasb exposed for public comment a proposed fsp that would change the method of accounting for convertible debt securities that requires or permits settlement in cash either in whole or in part upon conversion cash settled convertible debt securities  which includes our convertible debt securities  and 
table of contents would require the proposed method to be retrospectively applied 
the fasb expects to begin deliberations on the proposed fsp in february the fsp  if issued as proposed  would become effective for calendar year end companies like us in the first quarter of under this proposed method of accounting  the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities would be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that would result in recognizing interest on these securities at effective rates more comparable to what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms 
the equity component of our convertible debt securities would be included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and  accordingly  the initial carrying values of these debt securities would be reduced 
our net income for financial reporting purposes would be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional non cash interest expense 
therefore  if the proposed method of accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities is adopted by the fasb as described above  it would have an adverse impact on our past and future reported financial results 
as the final guidance has not been issued  we cannot predict its ultimate outcome 
we also cannot predict any other changes in gaap that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities  some of which could have an adverse impact on our past or future reported financial results

the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the long term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the modified convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments 
future interest payments are included on the notes  the convertible notes  the convertible notes  the notes  notes  notes and the century notes at fixed rates of       and  respectively 
we used an interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the future interest payments on our variable rate floating rate note and interest rate swaps 
holders of the modified convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates  the next of which is march   at the then accreted value 
consequently  the amount above reflects the modified convertible notes accreted value on march   the next put date 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i our long term supply agreement with bi pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of enbrel  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for enbrel and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved  ii r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  iii capital expenditures and iv open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
in addition to the current liabilities for utbs included in the table above  long term liabilities for utbs net of federal tax benefits on state taxes and related accrued interest totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the contractual obligations table because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
in addition to the above table  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of in licensing and product development programs all of which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
such events could include  but are not limited to  development milestones  regulatory 
table of contents approvals and product sales 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been included in the above table or recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period 
however  if the achievement of the milestones covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the resulting payment obligation would be approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales incentives and returns sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  discounts and other incentives collectively sales incentives and returns 
in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell outside the united states are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns 
accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales 
sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales incentives are product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
for the years ended december   and  reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives were comprised of the following dollar amounts in millions rebates wholesaler chargebacks discounts and other incentives total sales incentives percent of gross product sales rebates earned in the united states by healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers and hospitals are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate 
these rebates are generally performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and segment share 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled billion in  billion in and billion in we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on our recent experience  changes in annual estimates related to prior 
table of contents annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods 
these changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period 
a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million on our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled billion for each of the years ended december   and accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
however  such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives in millions balance at beginning of period amounts charged against product sales payments balance at end of period year ended december  december  includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represented approximately of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both and accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales 
returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate 
historically  sales return provisions have been insignificant  amounting to approximately of gross product sales 
deferred income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  governmental investigations and class action suits 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in note  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 

table of contents in addition  our income tax returns are routinely audited by the internal revenue service irs and various state and foreign tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items  one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries 
we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting appropriate credit limits  requiring collateral and obtaining credit insurance  where appropriate 
in addition  we have an investment policy that limits investments in certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer 
we also enter into various types of derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
in  the us economy was affected by increased defaults on consumer subprime mortgages  which caused a tightening in the credit market and created volatility in the capital markets 
in an attempt to increase liquidity and stimulate the economy  the us federal government has recently reduced the interest rate charged to institutional borrowers 
short term interest rates have declined into early and may fluctuate in the near term in excess of historical norms 
as a result  in the discussion that follows  we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of from those at december  interest rate sensitive financial instruments our investment portfolio of available for sale securities at december  and was comprised primarily of fixed rate us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporate debt instruments and  to a lesser degree  other interest bearing securities 
the fair value of our investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of our investment portfolio is more sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates than the income it generates because of the significant composition of fixed rate securities 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of relative to interest rates at december  and a hypothetical change in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december  would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities or our cash flows or income 

table of contents on december   we had outstanding debt of billion with a fair value of billion  including billion of convertible debt with a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  was comprised of billion of debt with fixed interest rates and billion of debt with variable interest rates 
on december   we had billion of outstanding fixed rate debt with a fair value of billion  including billion of convertible debt with a fair value of billion 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on our fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical change in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on income or cash flows on our billion of variable rate debt outstanding at december  changes in interest rates would affect the fair values of all of our outstanding debt at december  and  including  to a lesser extent  our variable rate debt for which the interest rate resets quarterly 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  for certain of our fixed rate debt with carrying values totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these agreements swap the receipt of fixed interest payments for libor based variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes 
a hypothetical change in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  would result in a change of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt and would not have a material effect on the fair value  cash flows or income with respect to our interest rate swap agreements 
a hypothetical change in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt or on fair values  cash flows or income with respect to our interest rate swap agreements 
market price sensitive instruments as noted above  a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt 
a hypothetical decrease in the price of amgen stock from the price at december  and would have reduced the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
on december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio on december  and was not material 
foreign currency sensitive instruments our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our results of operations  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts 
on december   we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
on december   we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
these contracts are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december  and the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material 
with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  and december  would result in a reduction in fair value  cash flows and income of approximately million and million  respectively 
also on december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and li 
table of contents abilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of december  and with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  and december  would not have a material impact on fair value  cash flows or income 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset
