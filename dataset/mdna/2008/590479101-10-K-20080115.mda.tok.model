item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  and the selected financial data and operating statistics contained elsewhere in this form k 
executive overview fiscal was a year of challenges and modest successes for us 
during fiscal we formed a joint venture in china with shenzhen airlines and commenced flying seat crj aircraft 
we expect to be flying aircraft by the summer of in time for the beijing olympic games 
china s market is considerably larger than the u 
s and we expect this joint venture to materially contribute to our results of operations in the future 
this new joint venture has also enabled us to transition certain excess seat regional jet aircraft to china and reduce our exposure to certain unprofitable seat regional jets flying with united airlines 
in connection with an amendment to and assumption of our existing delta connection agreement  we received a general unsecured claim of million as part of delta s bankruptcy proceeding 
during the third quarter of the company received  shares of delta stock representing approximately of the total award 
these shares were sold in the same quarter for approximately million 
the resulting gain was deferred and is being amortized over the remainder of the amended dca 
we experienced a setback in our hawaiian litigation 
in october  the united states bankruptcy court for the district of hawaii found that the company violated the terms of a confidentiality agreement between hawaiian and mesa and awarded hawaiian million in damages and ordered the company to pay hawaiian s cost of litigation  reasonable attorneys fees and interest 
a loss contingency of million has been recorded in the statements of operations for fiscal we have filed a notice of appeal to this ruling 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company continually considers events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of a long term asset may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of the company evaluated two such cases 
in each instance the gross undiscounted cash flows related to a long term asset were computed and found to be less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the fair market value of the two assets was then determined and an impairment charge  equal to the excess of the carrying value over fair value  was recorded totaling million during the second quarter 
the first impairment charge  totaling million  related to the unamortized balance of a million nonrefundable cash incentive incentive paid to united prior to fiscal  upon amending our code share agreement with united the amendment and leasehold improvements relating to certain aircraft operating under the united code share agreement 
the amendment primarily allowed us to place additional aircraft with united  bringing the total aircraft under the united code share agreement to and to extend the expiration dates under the existing code share agreement with respect to certain of the other aircraft 
the incentive was included in other 
table of contents assets and was being amortized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the amended code share agreement 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal we began experiencing declining margins related to this code share and management initiated an operational analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal the margins deteriorated further  resulting in management concluding that the company will incur operating losses over the remaining term of the amended code share agreement 
the analysis determined that these losses were due primarily to increases in maintenance costs from certain contractual increases in maintenance support agreements that went into effect in the second quarter of fiscal  lower total completion factors primarily attributable to the locations from which we operate the additional aircraft added in the amended code share agreement  resulting in higher operational costs and higher labor costs resulting from employee turnover and  other underlying costs increasing at greater rates than we had originally anticipated when we entered into the amended code share agreement 
in order to determine whether or not this asset was impaired  we estimated the future gross undiscounted cash flows related to this code share agreement and found them to be less than the asset s unamortized balance 
the fair value of the asset was determined to be zero 
accordingly  an impairment charge was taken for million during the second quarter 
in addition  leasehold improvements related to certain aircraft under the united code share agreement were evaluated for recoverability and were determined to be impaired and accordingly an impairment charge was taken for million during the second quarter 
management is evaluating various alternatives to address the situation  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 
during fiscal  we parked dash aircraft  associated with the delta code share agreement 
due to higher than anticipated costs associated with our delta dash fleet related to our jfk operations  the company and delta developed a joint plan to eliminate the dash fleet from the jfk operations 
the agreement reached with delta called for service to conclude by august  losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties  lease settle up and other charges 
the estimated costs associated with the parking and early termination of the lease agreements totaling approximately million have been recorded in our statements of operations in fiscal although we experienced relatively flat operating revenues  from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal  we experienced material increases in maintenance  air and traffic servicing  and general and administrative expenses  resulting in our first annual net loss in five years 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company committed to a plan to sell air midwest or certain assets thereof 
air midwest consists of turboprop operations  which includes our independent mesa operations 
midwest airlines code share operations  and our beechcraft d turboprop code share operations with us airways 
in connection with this decision  the company began soliciting bids for the sale of the twenty beechcraft d aircraft in operation and began to take the necessary steps to exit the eas markets that we serve and expect to be out of all eas markets by the end of fiscal all assets and liabilities  results of operations  and other financial and operational data associated with these assets have been presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
for all periods presented  we reclassified operating results of the air midwest turboprop operation to loss from discontinued operations 
code share agreements freedom commenced operations with delta in october and is contracted to operate up to seat regional jet aircraft on routes throughout delta s network 
during the second quarter of  delta exercised its right to terminate our turboprop code sharing agreement and we subsequently removed all dash aircraft from service recognizing exit costs of million  but agreed to expand our service pursuant to an amendment to our existing code sharing agreement and an agreement for a new service 
under the terms of the new code sharing agreement  we are authorized to operate crj aircraft as a delta connection carrier 
this new service began in november and as of december  we are operating two crj aircraft for delta s network

this compares to consolidated net income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal and consolidated net income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal approximately of our passenger revenue was associated with revenue guarantee code share agreements 
under the terms of our revenue guarantee agreements  our major carrier partner controls the marketing  scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories 
our role is simply to operate our fleet in the safest and most reliable manner in exchange for fees paid under a generally fixed payment schedule 
we receive a guaranteed payment based upon a fixed minimum monthly amount plus amounts related to departures and block hours flown in addition to direct reimbursement of expenses such as fuel  landing fees and insurance 
among other advantages  revenue guarantee arrangements reduce our exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic and fare levels  as well as fuel prices 
in fiscal  approximately of our fuel purchases were reimbursed under revenue guarantee code share agreements 
the remaining passenger revenues are derived from our go operations

a portion of that charge  million  related to certain contract incentives that had previously been paid to united and were reflected against gross revenue in the statements of operations 
operating revenues for go increased million  or  primarily due to fiscal including twelve months of operations at go  as compared to four months in fiscal operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal on an asm basis  flight operations expense increased to cents per asm in fiscal from cents per asm in fiscal the increase is driven by incremental employee related expenses of approximately million  which is primarily due to our delta dash operation at jfk

in fiscal  approximately of our fuel costs were reimbursed by our code share partners 
maintenance in fiscal  maintenance expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal on an asm basis  maintenance expense increased to cents per asm in fiscal from cents per asm in fiscal the increase in maintenance expense is primarily due to incremental costs of approximately million related to changes in maintenance contracts and additional component repair  and aircraft heavy maintenance expense of approximately million related to the aging crj and dash fleet 
maintenance expense also increased as a result of increased headcount and the fact that go included twelve months of operations in fiscal as compared to four months in fiscal

general and administrative in fiscal  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase is primarily related to bad debt expense  wages and legal expenses 
fiscal bad debt expense was reduced by the receipt of million related to the pre merger us airways bankruptcy that was previously reserved and other items that were established in fiscal wages increased in various corporate departments and legal expenses increased due to litigation involving go and the start up of the chinese joint venture  kunpeng airlines 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of three crj aircraft during the second quarter of  as well as a full years depreciation on aircraft purchased in fiscal in addition  depreciation and amortization increased due to go results including twelve months of operations in fiscal year as compared to four months in fiscal loss contingency on october   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of hawaii found that the company had violated the terms of a confidentiality agreement with hawaiian airlines and awarded hawaiian million in damages and ordered the company to pay hawaiian s cost of litigation  reasonable attorneys fees and interest

table of contents agreements where the gross undiscounted cash flows related to long lived assets was computed and found to be less than the carrying value of the long lived assets 
there were no such impairment charges in the twelve months ended september  interest expense in fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal approximately one half of this increase is due to higher average outstanding debt balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remainder of the increase is due to a higher variable rate portion of interest on our long term debt 
interest income in fiscal  interest income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase is due to higher rates of return on our outstanding cash and cash equivalents and portfolio of marketable securities 
loss from equity method investments in fiscal  loss from equity method investments increased million to million from million for fiscal the increase is due to our proportional share of losses on our investment in kunpeng airlines  which did not begin revenue generating activities until the end of fiscal  our share of losses related to fiscal investment in the preferred shares of a closely held emerging markets payment processing related business  and losses associated with our investment in the common stock and notes of a closely held airline related business 
other income expense in fiscal  other income expense decreased million to million from million for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to million in debt conversion expenses in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  partially offset by unrealized losses on investment securities 
income taxes in fiscal  our effective tax rate decreased from for fiscal to 
the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the rate impact of the inverse relationship of operating losses and non deductible items as well as increased valuation allowances and state only tax items 
fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenue increased by million  or  from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal this increase is due  in large part  to a million increase in fuel reimbursements by our code share partners 
in addition  fiscal included four months of our go operations 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal on an asm basis  flight operations expense increased to cents per asm in fiscal from cents per asm in fiscal the increase is primarily driven by aircraft lease expense increasing million in fiscal  due to the sale and leaseback of crj aircraft in september in addition  wages and employee related expenses increased million in fiscal these increases are a result of training costs associated with the transition of aircraft onto the freedom certificate as well as the start up of the company s delta dash operations at new york s jfk airport 
flight operations expense also increased due to the start up of go operations 

table of contents fuel in fiscal  fuel expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal on an asm basis  fuel expense increased to cents per asm in fiscal from cents per asm in fiscal fuel cost per gallon in fiscal increased from per gallon in fiscal to per gallon in fiscal  resulting in a million unfavorable price variance

in fiscal  of our fuel costs were reimbursed by our code share partners 
maintenance in fiscal  maintenance expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal on an asm basis  maintenance expense increased to cents per asm in fiscal from cents per asm in fiscal the increase was driven by an approximate million increase in aircraft heavy maintenance and rotable spare part repair and rent expense  an approximate million increase in engine maintenance  a million increase in materials  repairs and servicing expenses  and a million increase in hangar rent 
these increases are due to the timing of certain maintenance events for the company s aircraft and the establishment of additional bases to support the united and delta operations

in fiscal we incurred million due to the startup of go 
promotion and sales expense in fiscal was negligible 
general and administrative in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease was driven by administrative costs which included a million reduction in bad debt expense from the pre merger us airways bankruptcy settlement and a million reduction in medical expenses 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in legal expenses and a million increase in utilities 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in depreciation expense as a result of permanently financing crj aircraft as operating leases in the fourth quarter of fiscal bankruptcy settlement in fiscal  the company received approximately  shares of us airways common stock as part of our bankruptcy claim against pre merger us airways 
the shares were valued at approximately per share  therefore the company recognized approximately million in benefit from its claim

our proportional share of losses associated with this investment totaled million 
there were no such losses in other income expense in fiscal  other income expense increased million from an income of million for fiscal to an expense of million for fiscal the increase is primarily due to million increase in debt conversion costs and a million decrease in gains on investment securities 
income taxes in fiscal  our effective tax rate increased from for fiscal to 
the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the inability to deduct stock option expense related to incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
results of discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell air midwest or certain assets therein 
in connection with this decision  the company began soliciting bids for the sale of the twenty beechcraft d aircraft in operation and began to take the necessary steps to exit the eas markets that we serve 
within the next fiscal year  the company expects to sell air midwest in its entirety or sell certain operating assets thereof  primarily the twenty beechcraft s 
for all periods presented  we reclassified operating results of the air midwest turboprop operation to loss from discontinued operations 
all assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations were reclassified to the balance sheet captions assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations  respectively 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal was million  compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal as compared to prior years was due primarily to increased maintenance costs and engine overhauls

table of contents in august  we entered into a ten year agreement with aar corp 
the aar agreement  for the management and repair of certain of our crj   and erj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory 
under the agreement  the company sold certain existing spare parts inventory to aar for million in cash and million in notes receivable to be paid over four years 
the aar agreement was contingent upon the company terminating an agreement for its crj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory with ge capital aviation services gecas and including these rotables in the arrangement 
we terminated the gecas agreement and finalized the aar agreement in november upon entering into the agreement  the company received million million less million deposit that was retained by aar  which was recorded as a deposit at september   pending the termination of the gecas agreement 
an additional million was received in the quarter ended december  under the agreement  we are required to pay aar a monthly fee based upon flight hours for access to and maintenance and servicing of the inventory 
the agreement also contains certain minimum monthly payments that mesa must make to aar 
as of september   the remaining minimum fees payable over the term of the agreement totaled million 
based on this arrangement  we account for the transaction as a service agreement and an operating lease of rotable spare parts with aar 
the sale of the rotable spare parts resulted in a gain of million  which has been deferred and is being recognized over the term of the agreement 
at termination  we may elect to purchase the covered inventory at fair value  but are not contractually obligated to do so 
in june  we entered into a separate two year agreement with aar for the management and repair of our crj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory associated with our go operations 
under this agreement  we transferred certain existing spare parts inventory to aar for million in cash 
aar is required to purchase an additional million in rotable spare parts to support the agreement 
under the agreement  we are required to pay aar a monthly fee based upon flight hours for access to and maintenance of the inventory 
as of september   the remaining minimum fees payable over the term of the agreement totaled million 
at termination  we have guaranteed the fair value of the underlying rotables 
based on this arrangement  we account for the transaction as a financing arrangement  thus recording both the rotable spare parts inventory as an asset and the related payable to aar as a liability 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with delta s technical operations division dto for its previously uncovered general electric aircraft engines ge engines 
as referenced above  the mou contemplates that the ge cf b engines  currently covered by the ge contract scheduled to expired in december  will be transitioned to and covered by the dto maintenance program 
the mou requires a monthly payment based upon the prior month s flight hours incurred by the covered engines 
the hourly rate increases over time based upon the engine overhaul costs that are expected to be incurred in that year and is subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
maintenance expense is recognized based upon the product of flight hours flown and the rate in effect for the applicable period 
negotiations are continuing between the company and dto and we anticipate executing a final definitive agreement in the first quarter of fiscal year we believe that the company will be able to meet its ongoing financial requirements through a combination of existing liquidity  operational cash flows  refinancing or some type of capital market transaction 
capital contribution commitment to kunpeng under the terms of the joint venture agreement  shenzhen airlines and the company are obligated to contribute an additional rmb  and rmb  approximately million and million  respectively  at december  to kunpeng in accordance with kunpeng s operational requirements as determined by kunpeng s board of directors  but in any event  prior to may  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and 
table of contents related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  medical claims and workers compensation claims reserves  impairment of long lived assets and valuation of assets held for sale  costs to return aircraft  litigation claims and assessments and a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
such historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition the delta  united and us airways regional jet code share agreements are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under a revenue guarantee arrangement  the major airline generally pays a fixed monthly minimum amount  plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights flown and block hours performed 
the contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by us in performing flight services 
these costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes as well as  fuel  landing fees and catering 
the contracts also include a profit component that may be determined based on a percentage of profits on the mesa flown flights  a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs as well as a profit margin based on certain operational benchmarks 
we recognize revenue under our revenue guarantee agreements when the transportation is provided 
the majority of the revenue under these contracts is known at the end of the accounting period and is booked as actual 
we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed 
under the company s revenue guarantee agreements with delta  united and us airways  the company is reimbursed under a fixed rate per block hour plus an amount per aircraft designed to reimburse the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and has been included in passenger revenue on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with providing service under the company s revenue guarantee agreement with pre merger us airways  the company s fuel reimbursement was capped at per gallon 
under this agreement  the company had the option to purchase fuel from a subsidiary of us airways at the capped rate 
as a result  amounts included in revenue for fuel reimbursement and expense for fuel cost may not have represented market rates for fuel for the company s pre merger us airways flying 
the company purchased million gallons and million gallons of fuel under this arrangement in fiscal and  respectively 
the company did not purchase any fuel under this arrangement in fiscal the us airways and midwest airlines beechcraft d turboprop code share agreements are pro rate agreements 
under a prorate agreement  we receive a percentage of the passenger s fare based on a standard industry formula that allocates revenue based on the percentage of transportation provided 
revenue from our pro rate agreements and our independent operation is recognized when transportation is provided 
tickets sold but not yet used are included in air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents during the second quarter of fiscal  as part of delta s bankruptcy  we reached an agreement with delta for an amendment to and assumption of our existing code sharing agreement amended dca  as well as for a new code sharing agreement expansion dca 
the compensation structure for the expansion dca is similar to the structure in the amended dca  except that the crj aircraft will be owned by delta and leased to us for a nominal amount and no mark up or incentive compensation will be paid on fuel costs above a certain level or on fuel provided by delta 
additionally  certain major maintenance expense items engine and airframe will be reimbursed based on actual expenses incurred 
as a result  our revenue and expenses attributable to flying the crj s will be substantially less than if we provided the aircraft 
we also receive subsidies for providing scheduled air service to certain small or rural communities 
such revenue is recognized in the period in which the air service is provided 
the amount of the subsidy payments is determined by the united states department of transportation on the basis of its evaluation of the amount of revenue needed to meet operating expenses and to provide a reasonable return on investment with respect to eligible routes 
eas rates are normally set for two year contract periods for each city 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounts billed by the company under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to our interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by our code share partners 
periodically our code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reached a settlement with respect to a dispute with us airways related to fees payable pursuant to the code share agreement 
in settlement of this dispute through july  us airways has agreed to pay us a lump sum of  plus agreed upon monthly amounts per aircraft for the period commencing in august through the balance of the agreement 
as such  we periodically review amounts past due and record a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if our actual ability to collect these receivables and the actual financial viability of our partners is materially different than estimated  our estimate of the allowance could be materially misstated 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that the company and or one of its partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft  losses may be incurred related to such an activity 
in the event that the company exits an activity that results in exit losses as in the case of the dash s previously discussed  these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties  lease settle up and other charges 
accrued health care costs we are currently self insured up to a cap for health care costs and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet dates is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our health care provider 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future health care claims could be materially misstated 

table of contents accrued worker s compensation costs beginning in fiscal  we implemented a new worker s compensation program 
under the program  we are self insured up to a cap for worker s compensation claims and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our third party administrator 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of worker s compensation claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future worker s compensation claims could be materially misstated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment loss has occurred  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
as previously discussed  we recorded significant losses in fiscal related to the impairment of long lived assets 
as discussed previously  in february  hawaiian airlines  inc hawaiian filed a complaint against us in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of hawaii the bankruptcy court alleging that we had breached  among other things  the terms of a confidentiality agreement 
on october   the bankruptcy court found that we violated the terms of the confidentiality agreement and awarded hawaiian million in damages and ordered us to pay hawaiian s cost of litigation  reasonable attorneys fees and interest 
while we have filed a notice of appeal to this ruling  we can give no assurance that our appeal will result in a favorable outcome for us 
in november  we posted a million bond as security for the judgment amount by placing such amount with a surety acceptable to the bankruptcy court 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  fas we evaluated the judgment rendered against us for potential recognition in the financial statements 
we determined that it was probable defined as likely to occur that the company had incurred a loss and the amount of that loss was reasonably estimable as defined by fas and accordingly we recorded a loss contingency of million as of september  representing the sum of the judgment  legal fees and interest in this matter 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards  and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
we periodically review these assets for realizability based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent we believe some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  for certain state net operating loss carryforwards because we believe we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions in the future to realize the benefits of these recorded deferred tax assets 
we believe we will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the benefits of our other deferred tax assets 
this belief is based upon the company having had pretax income in four of the last five fiscal years and we have taken steps to minimize the financial impact of our unprofitable subsidiaries 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining  recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is significantly different from our expectations  the value of its deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf applies to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer 
eitf allows companies to present taxes either gross within revenue and expense or net 
if taxes subject to this issue are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amount of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the company currently presents such taxes net  adopting eitf during the second quarter of fiscal these taxes are currently not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year we are in the process of evaluating the impact sfas will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this position amends the existing major maintenance accounting guidance contained within the aicpa industry audit guide audits of airlines and prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities for owned aircraft 
the provisions of the announcement are applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  mesa currently uses the direct expense method of accounting for planned major maintenance  therefore  the adoption of fsp no 
aug air will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the impact fin will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
under sfas  companies have an opportunity to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact sfas will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
certain of our debt obligations are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million 
table of contents impact on interest expense 
we also have investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  the delta  united and us airways revenue guarantee code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  approximately of our fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense that is not reimbursed by our code share partners 
as of december   our outstanding obligation to make additional capital contributions to kunpeng under the joint venture agreement had an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
the potential increase in the fair value of this obligation resulting from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million at december
