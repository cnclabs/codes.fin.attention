overview we are a designer  marketer and distributor of innovative  action sports inspired products under the heelys brand targeted to the youth market 
our primary product  heelys wheeled footwear  is patented  dual purpose footwear that incorporates a stealth  removable wheel in the heel 
heelys wheeled footwear allows the user to seamlessly transition from walking or running to skating by shifting weight to the heel 
users can transform heelys wheeled footwear into street footwear by removing the wheel 
in  approximately of our net sales was derived from the sale of our heelys wheeled footwear 
we also sell branded accessories  such as replacement wheels  helmets and other protective gear 
in the third quarter of we introduced a limited variety of apparel items in response to demand from certain of our retail customers and in we introduced a line of non wheeled footwear to broaden and extend the heelys brand 
we introduced heelys wheeled footwear in  and for several years our domestic sales were concentrated with one large  national specialty retailer 
although we initially focused on driving our domestic sales growth  we also established relationships with an independent distributor in each of japan  south korea and southeast asia 
as a result  the sources of our net sales were largely concentrated and we were susceptible to customer specific and region specific factors  including competition from counterfeit  knockoff and infringing products in international markets 
this concentration caused variability in our results of operations 
since that time  we have diversified our retail customer base in the united states and expanded our international distribution channels to mitigate this concentration 
continued growth of our net sales will depend on consumer demand for heelys wheeled footwear and our ability to satisfy this demand 
a number of factors may impact consumer demand for our products  including the effectiveness of our marketing strategies  our ability to effectively distribute our products  our ability to design products that appeal to our target consumers  our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  general economic conditions  particularly changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns  and changes in the popularity of and participation rates in wheeled sports activities 
we intend to continue to diversify our product offering with new heelys wheeled footwear models  product categories and accessories in order to benefit from the increasing recognition of our heelys brand and the growing market for action sports inspired products 
designing  marketing and distributing new products will require us to devote additional resources to product development  marketing and operations 
these additional resources may include hiring new employees to support expansion in these areas and increasing amounts allocated to product advertising and promotion 
each of these additional resource commitments will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
because the selling price and unit cost of new products may differ from those of our existing products  sales of these new products may also impact our gross margin 
in addition  we may seek to selectively acquire products and companies that offer products that are complementary to ours 
recent developments we recently experienced challenges related primarily to higher than expected inventory positions of product at many of our domestic accounts as weekly unit sales were lower than internal projections of many of our domestic retail customers  which had a significant adverse effect on our results for the second half of we believe that this was attributed to aggressive sell through expectations of some of our domestic retailers going into the summer months and retail softness in footwear and apparel 
certain of our major retailers were reluctant to place significant fourth quarter orders until their current inventory was reduced to their targeted levels 
we also saw decreased prices on our products at certain of our retailers in the fourth quarter of these factors led us to work closely with each of our key retail customers to assist them in managing their inventory and sell through 
this included providing marketing discretionary funds  rescheduling orders to later dates  accepting cancellations  increasing marketing  promotion and advertising support  and accepting returns 
as a result  our net sales for the second half of were negatively impacted by approximately million related to an increase in our reserve for marketing discretionary fund assistance and approximately million as a result of an increase in our returns reserve 
of the million increase in our returns reserve  million was attributable to negotiated returns from two of our retail customers 
both of these reserves are recorded as reductions to revenue and were related to domestic sales 
additionally  as a result of the decrease in net sales during the second half of and cancelled orders  our inventory position at year end was greater than we have historically seen 
we performed an analysis of our inventory position  including open purchase commitments  and determined that certain of our inventory was impaired which resulted in a million write down of our inventories on hand and a  loss on purchase commitments related to inventory that was still being held by the manufacturers 
these impairment charges are recognized in cost of sales 
in  we expect to see certain of our retail customers being more cautious when placing future orders and shifting toward shorter lead times 
this trend will require us to take a more aggressive inventory position to be able to meet at once orders 
while we will continue to experience some rescheduled orders  cancellations and returns in the normal course of business  we do not anticipate  at this time  for those to be as significant as those we encountered during the second half of additionally  we will continue to provide marketing  promotional and advertising support to our retail customers to promote the sell through of our products 
we will actively monitor inventory levels at our retail customers in an effort to manage the balance between supply and demand in the retail channel 
general net sales net sales represent primarily sales of heelys wheeled footwear  less an estimated reserve for sales returns  allowances including certain allowances for marketing  promotion and advertising support and discounts 
a small portion of our net sales are derived from the sale of accessories such as replacement wheels  helmets and other protective gear  a limited variety of apparel items and beginning in  our new line of heelys non wheeled footwear 
amounts billed to domestic customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
we sell our products through distribution channels that merchandise our products in a manner that we believe enhances and protects our heelys brand image 
domestically  our products can be found in full line sporting goods retailers  specialty apparel and footwear retailers  select department stores  family footwear stores and online retailers 
for  of our net sales were derived from domestic retail customers 
internationally  our products are sold to independent distributors with exclusive rights to specified territories 
sales to our independent distributors are denominated in us dollars 
no country  other than the united states accounted for or more of our net sales for cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales consists primarily of the cost to purchase finished products from our independent manufacturers 
cost of sales also includes inbound and outbound freight  warehousing expenses  tooling depreciation  royalty expenses related to licensed intellectual property  an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs and  until  commissions paid to our independent sourcing agent 
we source all of our products and accessories from manufacturers located in china  indonesia and south korea 
our product costs are largely driven by the prices we negotiate with our independent manufacturers 
each season  we negotiate a unit price for each model of heelys wheeled footwear 
factors that influence these prices include raw materials and labor costs and foreign exchange rates 
we believe that our sourcing model allows us to minimize our capital investment  retain the production flexibility  cost effectiveness and scalability inherent in the use of independent manufacturers and focus our resources on developing new products and enhancing our heelys brand image 
through december   we paid our independent sourcing agent a commission equal to a specified percentage of our per unit cost  with the percentage decreasing when our annual purchases exceed a predetermined unit volume threshold 
in january  we opened a representative office in qingdao  china and terminated our consulting agreement with our independent sourcing agent 
this new office will serve multiple sourcing functions including quality control  price negotiation  logistics and product development 
we believe our qingdao office will help us improve our research and development efforts  enhance communication between us and our distribution and manufacturing partners and give us more direct control over the manufacturing and sourcing process 
this new office will be managed by our vice president sourcing 
costs related to operating this office will be included in cost of sales 
we generally avoid selling our products at close out prices 
when demand for our products slows  we discount our products to reduce our inventory  which causes our gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  to decline 
our gross margin is affected by our sourcing and distribution costs  our product mix and our ability to avoid excess inventory by accurately forecasting demand for our products 
the unit prices that we charge our domestic retail customers are generally higher than what we charge our independent distributors for similar products  because our independent distributors are responsible for distribution and marketing costs relating to our products 
the gross margin for products sold to our domestic retail customers and independent distributors are similar  however  due to higher shipping costs and standard customer discounts and allowances related to domestic sales 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination and record it to cost of sales 
as result of the decrease in net sales during the second half of and cancelled orders  our inventory position at year end was greater than we have historically seen 
we performed an analysis of our inventory position  including open purchase commitments  and determined that certain of our inventory was impaired  which resulted in a million write down of our inventories on hand and a  loss on purchase commitments related to inventory that was still being held by the manufacturers 
these impairment charges are recognized in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising costs  travel and insurance expenses  product development costs  costs to enforce our intellectual property rights  depreciation  amortization  professional fees  facility expenses and costs associated with operating as a public company 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no 
r requires the measurement of compensation cost of stock based compensation awards based on the estimated fair value of that award on the date of grant 
we recognize this compensation cost using the straight line method over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which the employee does not render the required service 
if the requisite service is not provided  all previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for all awards granted to date  the requisite service period is the same as the vesting period of the award 
our selling  general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in future periods as we continue to hire additional personnel  develop our infrastructure  increase our brand recognition through marketing  increase our product development efforts  secure and enforce our intellectual property rights and incur expenses associated with operating as a public company 
income taxes we operate through heeling sports limited  a texas limited partnership 
texas recently passed legislation amending its franchise tax law 
as a result  we are now subject to the new texas franchise on gross margin sourced to the state of texas 
in addition  the company s activities in caused it to incur tax filing responsibilities in the state of california 
these changes resulted in an increase in our effective tax rate of

these cost reductions were partially offset by increased freight costs of of net sales  including extraordinary air freight costs incurred to offset startup production delays at several new factories 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in sales commissions related to our increased domestic net sales  together with a  increase in television advertising  a  increase in co op advertising  and  in stock based compensation

we used million of these proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility in and million to pay our estimated quarterly income taxes of million and million in and  respectively 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund infrastructure improvements  including expanding and upgrading our information technology systems  hire new employees  marketing and advertising programs  product development  expanding our international operations  working capital needs  and other general corporate purposes

this agreement is for one year with automatic one year renewal terms 
we expensed  and  related to this third party distribution facility in and  respectively 
there were no costs in these costs are included in cost of sales 
royalty agreement we pay monthly royalties related to a feature incorporated in our grind and roll heelys wheeled footwear equal to a percentage of the purchase price we pay to our manufacturers  net of the costs of the wheels and any other skating apparatus

purchase commitments at december   we had open purchase commitments of million related to inventories that were still being held by the manufacturers 
seasonality similar to other vendors of footwear products  sales of our products are subject to seasonality 
there are three major buying seasons in footwear spring summer  back to school and holiday 
shipments for spring summer take place during the first quarter and early weeks of the second quarter  shipments for back to school generally begin in may and finish in late august and shipments for the holiday season begin in october and finish in early december 
historically  we have experienced greater revenues in the second half of the year than those in the first half due to a concentration of shopping around the back to school and holiday seasons 
in  due to the growth of our business and the delays we experienced from our independent manufacturers  we experienced a higher percentage of net sales in the third quarter in comparison to the total year than we experienced in the past  as many orders were delayed from the second quarter to the third quarter  thereby causing the second quarter to be lower than normal and the third quarter to be higher than normal 
in  we estimate that approximately million of net sales shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to late shipments 
during we did not experience the same production delays  but instead experienced challenges related primarily to higher than expected inventory positions of product at many of our domestic accounts as weekly unit sales were lower than internal projections of many of our domestic retail customers  which had a significant adverse effect on our results for the second half of we believe that this was attributed to aggressive sell through expectations of some of our domestic retailers going into the summer months and retail softness in footwear and apparel 
certain of our major retailers are reluctant to place significant orders until their current inventory is reduced to their targeted levels 
we also saw decreased prices on our products at certain of our retailers in the fourth quarter of these factors have led us to work closely with each of our key retail customers to assist them in managing their inventory and sell through 
this process typically includes providing marketing discretionary funds  rescheduling orders to later dates  accepting cancellations  increasing marketing  promotion and advertising support  and accepting returns 
although weather is a factor in our seasonality  it is difficult to measure its impact 
results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
backlog historically  we received most of our orders three to four months prior to the date the products were shipped to customers 
at december   our backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  although generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment  cancellations have and may continue to occur 
due to the inventory challenges we experienced in the second half of  many of our retail customers have not placed significant future orders with us 
in  we expect to see certain of our retail customers being more cautious when placing future orders and shifting toward shorter lead times 
for a variety of reasons  including the timing of release dates for our product offerings  shipments  order deadlines and receipt of orders  backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales and may not be comparable from one period to another 
vulnerability due to customer concentration in  big sporting goods  journeys and the sports authority represented  and of our net sales  respectively 
for  journeys accounted for of our net sales 
for  finish line accounted for of our net sales 
no other retail customer or independent distributor accounted for or more of our net sales in any of these periods 
we anticipate that our net sales may remain concentrated for the foreseeable future 
if any of our significant retail customers or independent distributors decreases its purchases of our products or stops purchasing our products our net sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to net sales  collectability of accounts receivable  inventory reserve allowances  long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported consolidated financial results 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the agreement with the customer 
revenues are stated net of estimated returns and other allowances  including permitted returns of damaged or defective merchandise and marketing discretionary funds 
other allowances include funds for promotional and marketing activities and a volume based incentive program 
we base our estimates and judgements on historical experience and other various factors including customer communications  and analysis of relevant market information 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we continually make estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
if we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a benefit or charge to general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory write downs 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination and record it to cost of sales 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including furniture and fixtures  office equipment  plant equipment  leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software and certain intangible assets  are recorded at cost and this cost is depreciated over the asset s estimated useful life 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets and certain intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans or changes in anticipated cash flow 
when factors indicate that a long lived asset or certain intangible property should be evaluated for possible impairment  we review the asset or property to assess recoverability from future operations using the undiscounted pre tax future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or property 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
income tax 
we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full year and record a quarterly income tax expense in accordance with the anticipated effective annual tax rate 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and income before income taxes by jurisdiction during the year 
this process may result in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax expense during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date expense equals the expected annual rate 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  if we determine if it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established 
uncertain tax positions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
significant judgment is required in determining whether the recognition threshold has been met for recording an uncertain tax benefit and in determining the appropriate measurement of the uncertain benefit under fin stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement of compensation cost based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we recognize that cost using the straight line method over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
we determine the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the amount of compensation expense recognized will depend upon numerous factors and estimates  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the publicly traded price of our common stock  the estimated volatility of our common stock price  estimates of the timing and volume of exercises and forfeitures of the options and fluctuations in future interest and income tax rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had a million revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na that expired on june  as of december  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
to the extent we borrowed under our revolving credit facility  which bore interest at floating rates based either on the prime rate quoted by jpmorgan chase bank  na or an adjusted libor rate  we were exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
in september  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na which expires on june  and we have not borrowed under this revolving credit facility 
to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at floating rates based either on the prime rate quoted by jpmorgan chase bank  na or an adjusted libor rate  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
if applicable interest rates were to increase by basis points  for every million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  our income before income taxes would be reduced by approximately  per year 
we are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
our independent distributors pay us in us dollars 
because our independent manufacturers buy materials and pay for manufacturing expenses in their local currencies  to the extent the us dollar weakens compared to such local currencies  our operating results may be adversely affected 
conversely  to the extent the us dollar strengthens compared to local currencies in foreign markets where our products are sold  our products may appear more expensive relative to local products
