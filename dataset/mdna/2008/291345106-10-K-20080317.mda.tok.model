item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements above 
general emisphere technologies  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on a unique and improved delivery of therapeutic molecules using its eligen technology 
these molecules and compounds could be currently available or in development 
such molecules are usually delivered by injection  in many cases  their benefits are limited due to poor bioavailability  slow on set of action or variable absorption 
the eligen technology can be applied to the oral route of administration as well other delivery pathways  such as buccal  rectal  inhalation  intra vaginal or transdermal 
during  the composition of emisphere s senior management changed significantly 
michael v 
novinski was hired as president and chief executive officer in may mr 
novinski was previously president of organon usa inc  a business unit of organon biosciences inc in the last six months of  the majority of the former senior management team was separated from the company and new key management personnel were added 
new hires included a new senior director of communications  chief financial officer  and general counsel 
in addition  in october  gary riley  dvm  phd  was appointed to the position of vice president  nonclinical development and applied biology 
dr 
riley is responsible for oversight and management of nonclinical drug efficacy and safety programs and the strategic design of discovery projects 
since our inception in  substantial efforts and resources have been devoted to understanding the eligen technology and establishing a product development pipeline that incorporated this technology with selected molecules 
although no products have been commercialized to date  research and investment is now being placed behind both the pipeline and the advancement of this technology 
both the pipeline development and the further exploration of the technology for advancement results in risk and operational expenses 
it is not anticipated that ongoing costs will increase significantly  in fact  the organization continues to aggressively find ways to reduce non strategic spending 
between october and december   emisphere moved its corporate headquarters from tarrytown  new york to cedar knolls  new jersey 
emisphere will retain its scientific staff and laboratory facilities in tarrytown 
this move allows the company to potentially enhance collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies 
the move to new jersey is one of several real estate initiatives planned by the company that  cumulatively  could result in long term savings of over million annually 
emisphere s laboratories  vivarium and manufacturing facility will remain in tarrytown where we plan to reduce our rental space by approximately of 
emisphere further reduced operational costs in by cutting approximately of its employees 
severance payments to these employees were made in with some carrying over in the benefits of these operational cost reductions will be seen in providing adequate funding is available to us  our intention is to establish a strong development pipeline with prescription and nonprescription product candidates that incorporate our technology and that provide an improvement to the commercial pharmaceutical marketplace 
expenses in establishing this pipeline are expected to be partially offset with income generating license arrangements 
the value of out licensing arrangements tends to increase as product candidates move through pre clinical and into clinical development 
the application of the eligen technology is potentially broad and should provide for a significant number of opportunities across a spectrum of therapeutic modalities 
it is management s intention that additional investments that may be required to fund the company s research and development will be approached incrementally  in order to minimize disruption or dilution 
as a result of the ongoing analysis of the pipeline and the eligen technology  our business strategy is to focus on product candidates that we conclude have the most potential to work best within the strengths as well as the known constraints of our technology 
our efforts center on bringing the eligen technology to the commercial level as soon as possible 
value will be created through an increased effort to generate data about product candidates that can most effectively use our technology 
we will prioritize our product pipeline based on overall returns on investment and our determination of which candidates display greater probabilities of success 
we will focus on product candidates that demonstrate the most promise to meet unmet market needs 
we plan to attempt to expand our current collaborative relationships to take advantage of the critical knowledge that others have gained by working with our technology 
on a parallel track  we will also pursue product candidates for internal development and commercialization 
we believe that these internal candidates must be capable of development with reasonable investments in an acceptable time period and with a reasonable risk benefit profile 
we anticipate that our product pipeline will include both prescription and non prescription candidates 
for example  in the non prescription category  the company has initiated preliminary studies on an oral version of vitamin b and on the prescription side  the company s technology is being used by novartis with salmon calcitonin to treat osteoarthritis and osteoporosis 
novartis is conducting two phase iii clinical studies for osteoarthritis  with enrollment in the first trial to be completed by the third quarter of and with enrollment for the second phase iii trial to be complete in early osteoporosis phase iii trials are also ongoing  with enrollment completion expected in the first half of between these phase iii studies  there will be over  clinical study patients using the eligen technology in in addition  we are conducting early research using eligen technology and glp  a potential treatment for type diabetes 
our research indicates that glp may represent an excellent opportunity for emisphere 
the company had previously conducted extensive tests on oral insulin for type diabetes 
we have decided that a more productive pathway is to move forward with glp and its analogs  an oral form of which might be used for type diabetes 
a second  early stage human study of an oral formulation that combines pyy and glp has commenced 
the company expects to publish data from this study in based on our proof of concept animal studies of the absorption of vitamin b using our eligen technology  we will test whether vitamin b exposure obtained with the proprietary emisphere formulation will be significantly greater than the same dose of vitamin b administered in a pill 
emisphere is conducting additional pre clinical and will conduct clinical studies of the efficacy of our eligen technology to provide orally absorbed vitamin b the safety of the carrier we plan to use to deliver vitamin b has already been demonstrated 
since vitamins are regulated by the fda under different provisions than those used for drugs and biologicals  we anticipate that our studies will be shorter and less expensive than for a prescription drug 
the balance of our products in development are in earlier or pre clinical research and development  and we continue to assess them for their compatibility with our technology and market need 
our intent is to seek partnerships with highly regarded pharmaceutical companies for these products 
we plan to expand our pipeline with products that demonstrate significant opportunities for growth 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million and our stockholders deficit was million 
our operating loss was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  after receipts of collaboration and feasibility payments of million  million  and million  respectively which do not occur with regularity or at all  as well as income from the settlement of a lawsuit in of million 
our net loss was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded primarily with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
as of december   total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments were million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  without implementing cost reductions  raising additional capital  or obtaining substantial cash inflows from potential partners for our products  will enable us to continue operations through approximately july however  this expectation is based on the current operating plan that could change as a result of many factors and additional funding may be required sooner than anticipated 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our business will require substantial additional investment that we have not yet secured 
while our plan is to raise capital when needed and or to pursue partnering opportunities  we cannot be sure how much we will need to spend in order to develop  market and manufacture new products and technologies in the future 
we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  including amounts spent on conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
further  we will not have sufficient resources to develop fully any new products or technologies unless we are able to raise substantial additional financing on acceptable terms or secure funds from new or existing partners 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to raise capital when needed would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  and could force us to reduce or cease our operations 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
during the year ended december   our cash liquidity consisting of cash of million at december  and short term investments of million at december  decreased as follows cash and investments in thousands at december   at december   decrease in cash and investments  the decrease increase in cash and investments is comprised of the following components for the years ended december in thousands proceeds  net  from issuance of equity securities  proceeds from collaboration and other projects   net proceeds from settlement of lawsuit  sources of cash and investments   cash used in operations grossed up for collaborations and settlement of lawsuit   repayment of debts and capital expenditures restriction of cash uses of cash and investments   decrease increase in cash and investments  during the year ended december   our working capital liquidity decreased by million as follows december  change in thousands current assets    current liabilities    working capital    the decrease in current assets is driven primarily by the decrease in cash and investments 
the decrease in current liabilities is driven largely by decreases in the derivative instrument liability as a result of the decline in our stock price 
financing activities during  we received a million milestone payment and reimbursement of in costs from novartis on the oral salmon calcitonin program 
also during  we received million through the issuance of common stock and derivative instruments from the august offering of million shares of our common stock and warrants 
mhr was a purchaser in this offering 
during  we received a million milestone payment from novartis on the oral recombinant human growth hormone rhgh program 
also during  we received million through the issuance of common stock and derivative instruments  including million from the may offering of four million shares of our common stock and warrants  million from the exercise of warrants and stock options and million from the purchase of warrants 
mhr was a purchaser in this offering 
during  we received net proceeds of approximately million under a million secured loan agreement the loan agreement executed with mhr 
under the loan agreement  mhr requested  and on may   we effected  the exchange of the loan from mhr for senior secured convertible notes the convertible notes with substantially the same terms as the loan agreement  except that the convertible notes are convertible  at the sole discretion of mhr  into shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
the convertible notes are due on september   bear interest at and are secured by a first priority lien in favor of mhr on substantially all of our assets 
interest is payable in the form of additional convertible notes rather than in cash and we have the right to call the convertible notes after september  if certain conditions are satisfied 
further  the convertible notes provide mhr with the right to require redemption in the event of a change in control  as defined  prior to september  the convertible notes provide for various events of default 
if an event of default occurs  the convertible notes provide for the immediate repayment and certain additional amounts as set forth in the convertible notes 
we have received a waiver from mhr  through march  for certain defaults under the agreement 
additionally  mhr was granted certain registration rights 
in connection with the mhr financing  the company agreed to appoint a representative of mhr mhr nominee and another person the mutual director to its board of directors 
mhr nominees constitute of our directors 
further  the company amended its certificate of incorporation to provide for continuity of the mhr nominee and the mutual nominee on the board  as described therein  so long as mhr holds at least of the outstanding common stock of the company 
on december  we received million in exchange for issuance of a convertible note to novartis the novartis note in connection with a new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth the novartis note is convertible  at our option  at any time prior to maturity on december  into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
the novartis note bears interest at a rate of until december   from then until december   and from that point until maturity on december  we have the option to pay interest in cash on a current basis or accrue the periodic interest as an addition to the principal amount of the novartis note 
we are accruing interest which is being recorded using the effective interest rate method  which results in a level interest rate of 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands revenue    operating expenses excluding income from settlement of lawsuit  net    income from settlement of lawsuit  net   operating loss    beneficial conversion of convertible security   change in fair value of derivative instruments   net loss    revenue decreased significantly as compared to as a result of the million milestone payment received from novartis for rhgh in in we received a milestone payment from novartis on the oral salmon calcitonin program of million plus million for reimbursement of costs 
our principal operating costs include the following items as a percentage of total expenses year ended december  december  human resource costs  including benefits professional fees for legal  intellectual property  accounting and consulting occupancy for our laboratory and operating space clinical costs depreciation and amortization other operating expenses  excluding income from settlement of lawsuit  net  increased by million as a result of the following items in thousands increase in human resource costs  increase in clinical costs and lab fees  increase in professional and consulting fees increase in occupancy costs reduction in depreciation and amortization  all other net increase  human resource costs increased by million primarily due to the recording of million in severance expense for terminated employees as well as an increase in fas r expense of million and the accrual of the annual bonus for the chief executive officer of million 
the severance expense includes the accrual of costs estimated to settle the dispute with the company s chief executive officer and severance expense related to the termination of approximately employees during the termination of these employees was primarily done in an effort to fully utilize the staff of the company as well as to reduce future operating costs 
we do not expect to experience such a large termination of employees as in the increase in fas r expense is primarily related to the million charge for the granting of options to the new chief executive officer as well as the charges for terminated executives whose options were extended 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in salaries related to the reduction in employees 
clinical costs and lab fees increased primarily as a result of the toxicology studies being performed in anticipation of a heparin trial 
the increase of million in professional and consulting fees is primarily related to the formulation of the scientific advisory board for insulin as well as an increase in the outsourcing for data analysis and network maintenance 
we do not anticipate that the scientific advisory board will continue beyond early  although we do plan to consult with certain members of the board 
the increase in occupancy costs of million is related to the extension of the lease in the tarrytown  new york location  which resulted in an increase in rental expense 
during the last quarter of  the company started to surrender space in the tarrytown location back to the landlord 
in addition  in november  the company moved its executive offices from tarrytown to cedar knolls  new jersey in an effort to save on occupancy costs 
the decrease from the surrender of space in tarrytown will be partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs for cedar knolls in the cumulative effect of the real estate initiatives planned by the company could cumulatively result in long term savings of over million annually 
the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to the change in the estimated useful life of leasehold improvements as a result of the five year extension of the lease for our tarrytown facility on march  the income from the settlement of the lawsuit  net is due to the settlement of the litigation with eli lilly and company lilly 
on september   emisphere agreed to accept million from lilly to settle the pending litigation between the two companies 
emisphere received million of the settlement  net of attorneys fees and expenses 
the charge for beneficial conversion in is due to the conversion feature in the mhr notes  which did not exist until there was no such charge for the income from the change in the fair value of the derivatives instruments for is primarily the result of the decrease in stock price from at december  to at december   partially offset by the addition of  warrants from the august offering 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  these results include a number of non recurring transactions the charge for the beneficial conversion in  and the charges for severance payments to former employees  and are therefore not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands revenue    operating expenses    operating loss    beneficial conversion of convertible security   gain on extinguishment of note payable   change in fair value of derivative instruments  net loss    revenue increased significantly as compared to as a result of the million milestone payment received from novartis for rhgh 
operating expenses decreased by million as a result of the following items in thousands increase in human resource costs  reduction in clinical costs and lab fees  reduction in professional fees  all other net reduction  human resource costs increased by million primarily as a result of the implementation of fas r in  which resulted in an additional cost of million that did not occur in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in employees in research and development and in general and administration during clinical costs and lab fees decreased as the heparin and insulin trials that began in came to a conclusion in the reduction of million in professional fees is related to a decrease in legal expenses in as compared to in  we experienced higher than normal legal fees as a result of the lilly litigation  the re negotiation of the former ceo s employment contract  and the mhr note 
the charge for beneficial conversion in is due to the conversion feature in the mhr notes  which did not exist until the change in the fair value of the derivatives instruments increased primarily due to change in the stock price over the years and the issuance of  shares under warrants that were exercised 
additionally  mhr s warrant purchase option was converted into warrants for  shares during the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable of debt is related to the repurchase of our indebtedness to elan in  which is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  these results include a number of non recurring transactions the increase in revenue  the charge for the beneficial conversion in  and the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable to elan in  and are therefore not necessarily indicative of future results 
critical accounting estimates and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
share based payments on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  which establishes standards for share based transactions in which an entity receives employee s services for a equity instruments of the entity  such as stock options  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes the option of accounting for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that companies expense the fair value of stock options and similar awards  as measured on the awards grant date 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the date of adoption  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
we have elected to apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation cost is recognized only for the portion of awards outstanding for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the adoption date  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model the black scholes model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected forfeiture rates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we do not believe that reasonable changes in the projections would have had a material effect on share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition revenue includes amounts eamed from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies 
revenue from feasibility studies  which are typically short term in nature  is recognized upon delivery of the study  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue from collaboration agreements are recognized using the proportional performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best effort basis and based on expected payments 
under the proportional performance method  periodic revenue related to nonrefundable cash payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended to date as of that period to the total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual hours incurred and include research and development r d activities performed by us and time spent for joint steering committee jsc activities 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total r d and jsc hours incorporated into the project plan that is agreed to by both parties to the collaboration 
significant management judgments and estimates are required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
estimates of the total expected effort included in each project plan are based on historical experience of similar efforts and expectations based on the knowledge of scientists for both the company and its collaboration partners 
the company periodically reviews and updates the project plan for each collaborative agreement  the most recent reviews took place in january in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
generally under collaboration arrangements  nonrefundable payments received during the period of performance may include time or performance based milestones 
the proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to the expected payments in determining periodic revenue 
however  revenue is limited to the sum of the amount of nonrefundable cash payments received and the payments that are contractually due but have not yet been paid 
with regards to revenue recognition from collaboration agreements the company previously interpreted expected payments to equate to total payments subject to each collaboration agreement 
on a prospective basis  the company has revised its application of expected payments to equate to a best estimate of payments 
under this application  expected payments typically include i payments already received and ii those milestone payments not yet received but that the company believes are more likely than not of receiving 
our support for the assertion that the next milestone is likely to be met is based on the a project status updates discussed at jsc meetings  b clinical trial development results of prior phases  c progress of current clinical trial development phases  c directional input of collaboration partners and d knowledge and experience of the company s scientific staff 
after considering the above factors  the company believes those payments included in expected payments are more likely than not of being received 
while this interpretation differs from that used previously by the company  it does not result in any change to previously recognized revenues in either timing or amount for periods through december  purchased technology purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents and the rights to use  sell or license certain technology in conjunction with our proprietary carrier technology 
these assets underlie our research and development projects related to various research and development projects 
warrants warrants issued in connection with the equity financing completed in march and august and to mhr have been classified as liabilities due to certain provisions that may require cash settlement in certain circumstances 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the warrants to reflect their current fair value 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining term and the closing price of our common stock 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these derivative instruments could result in a material change in the fair value of the instruments 
we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the warrants are reasonable 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on the volatility in market value of derivative instruments 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided for on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which would result in additional impairment losses or losses on disposal of the assets 
during the years ended december   and  we did not recognize any significant impairment losses 
clinical trial accrual methodology clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we account for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrollment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded in accordance with the following methodology i the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  which are impacted by any change in the number of sites  number of patients and patient start dates  ii direct service costs  which are primarily on going monitoring costs  are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  and iii principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us for fiscal years beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company will be required to adopt sfas effective for the fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb affirmed the conclusions of the emerging issues task force eitf with respect to eitf issue no 
accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf concluded that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement should be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
this eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning january   and requires entities to recognize the effects of applying the guidance in this issue prospectively for new contracts entered into after january  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which  in our judgment  are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector 
these agreements are typically with business partners  clinical sites  and suppliers 
pursuant to these agreements  we generally agree to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates  use of such product candidates  or other actions taken or omitted by us 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the normal course of business  we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims  environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies 
we consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if  in our opinion  we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
after consultation with legal counsel  we do not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims  including the pending litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual arrangements significant contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amount due in less than to to more than type of obligation total year years years years in thousands long term debt    derivative liabilities   operating lease obligations     clinical research organizations total     amounts include both principal and related interest payments 
in december  we issued a million convertible note payable to novartis the novartis note due december interest may be paid annually or accreted as additional principal 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
upon the occurrence of an event of default prior to conversion  or within six months of conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable 
at december   the balance on the novartis note was million 
we have outstanding million in convertible notes payable to mhr and its affiliates mhr due september and convertible at the sole discretion of mhr into shares of our common stock at a price of 
interest at is payable in additional convertible notes rather than in cash and we have the right to call the convertible notes after september  if certain conditions are satisfied 
the convertible notes are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock which contain provisions requiring us to make a cash payment to the holders of the warrant for any gain that could have been realized if the holders exercise the warrants and we subsequently fail to deliver a certificate representing the shares to be issued upon such exercise by the third trading day after such warrants have been exercised 
as a result  these warrants have been recorded at their fair value and are classified as current liabilities 
the value and timing of the actual cash payments  if any  related to these derivative instruments could differ materially from the amounts and periods shown 
we are obligated to make payments under certain contracts with third parties who provide clinical research services to support our ongoing research and development 
on april   the board of directors appointed michael v 
novinski to the position of president and chief executive officer 
pursuant to his appointment  the company has entered into a three year employment agreement with mr 
novinski 
if mr 
novinski s contract is terminated without cause or at any time by the executive for good reason as defined in his contract  we are obligated to make severance payments to mr 
novinski 
in april  the company entered into an employment contract with its then chief executive officer  dr 
michael m 
goldberg  for services through july  on january   our board of directors terminated dr 
goldberg s services 
on april   the board of directors held a special hearing at which it determined that dr 
goldberg s termination was for cause 
on march   dr 
goldberg  through his counsel  filed a demand for arbitration asserting that his termination was without cause and seeking  plus attorney s fees  interest  arbitration costs and other relief 
dr 
goldberg s employment agreement provides  among other things  that in the event he is terminated without cause  he would be paid his base salary plus bonus  if any  for a severance period of eighteen months or  in the event of a change of control twenty four months  and he would also be entitled to continued health and life insurance coverage during the severance period and all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards would immediately vest in full upon such termination 
dr 
goldberg s employment agreement provides that in the event he is terminated with cause he will receive no additional compensation 
during the year ended december   the company accrued the estimated costs to settle this matter 
dr 
goldberg continues to serve on the board of directors 
his term as director is up at the annual meeting in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities 
at december   the value of derivative instruments was million 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining term and the closing price of our common stock 
we are required to revalue this liability each quarter 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock 
the following table illustrates the potential effect on the fair value of derivative instruments from changes in the assumptions made increase decrease in thousands increase in stock price increase in stock price increase in assumed volatility decrease in stock price decrease in stock price decrease in assumed volatility investments
