we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or changes to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in light of the uncertainty of the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  it is difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future and makes it impossible to determine if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
in the past  our results have been significantly impacted by a widespread slowdown in technology investment that pressured the storage networking market that is the mainstay of our business 
a downturn in information technology spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer oem customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payments  the emergence of new or stronger competitors as a result of consolidation movements in the market  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable and seasonal procurement patterns of our customers  the effects of terrorist activities  natural disasters and any resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  the effect of rapid migration of customers towards newer  lower cost product platforms  possible transitions from board or box level to application specific computer chip solutions for selected applications  a shift in unit product mix from higher end to lower end or mezzanine card products  a decrease in the average unit selling prices or an increase in

table of contents development  sales and marketing  capital equipment  and facilities in order to achieve our goal 
as of june   we had a total of employees 
global initiatives during the latter part of fiscal  we continued to implement our global initiatives by creating an irish subsidiary to expand our international operations by providing local customer service and support to our customers outside the united states 
in addition  emulex granted an intellectual property license and entered into a research and development cost sharing agreement with a newly formed subsidiary in the isle of man 
the terms of the license requires  among other matters  that the subsidiary make prepayments of expected royalties to emulex  the first of which was paid before the end of our fiscal in the amount of approximately million  for expected royalties relating to fiscal years and the second payment will be paid during fiscal  for expected royalties for fiscal years through subsequent royalty payments or prepayments will be made relating to fiscal year additionally  the cost sharing agreement became effective during the fourth quarter of while these global initiatives are expected to significantly reduce our effective tax rate beginning with fiscal year  the first prepayment and cost sharing agreement expenses  including the tax expense recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  resulted in an incremental tax expense of approximately million and increased our effective tax rate to approximately for fiscal our cash balances and investments are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
once our global initiatives are implemented  the cash and investments held outside of the us are expected to increase  primarily in our isle of man subsidiary 
substantially all of the amounts held outside of the us will be available for repatriation at any time  but under current law  repatriated funds would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
business combinations on october   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of sierra logic  inc sierra logic  a privately held supplier of embedded products for storage networking equipment located in roseville  california 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  including approximately million of cash for convertible preferred stock and common stock  approximately million in assumed vested stock options and other transaction costs of approximately million  and approximately million in contingent consideration released from escrow in fiscal this aggregate purchase price did not include approximately million in unvested stock and approximately million of assumed unvested stock options that is being recognized as compensation expense post acquisition 
final purchase price revisions for income taxes have been recorded during fiscal on may   we acquired of aarohi communications  inc aarohi  a supplier of intelligent data center networking products with principal product development facilities located in san jose  california and bangalore  india 
we accounted for the acquisition of aarohi under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and recorded approximately million of purchased in process research and development ipr d expense during fiscal the fair value of the net assets received by us in the aarohi acquisition exceeded the purchase price to be allocated 
consequently  contingent consideration of approximately million was recognized and was included in accrued liabilities during fiscal certain performance targets were not achieved and thus  the contingent consideration of approximately million previously recorded was reversed in fiscal the final purchase price revisions were also recorded in fiscal which resulted in changes to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as a reduction to ipr d expense in the statement of operations of approximately million 
we have finalized the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values as of the end of fiscal 
table of contents on november   we completed the cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of vixel corporation vixel 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vixel

we also incurred acquisition related expenses of approximately million in cash 
in addition  we assumed vixel s stock options outstanding by issuing approximately million of our stock options with a fair value of approximately million and kept the original vesting periods for a total acquisition value of million 
we calculated the fair value of the approximately million stock options issued at the date of acquisition using the black scholes merton options pricing model 
since the completion of the acquisitions  the operations of sierra logic  aarohi  and vixel  have been integrated into our operations and are included within our one operating segment  networking products 
convertible subordinated notes offering in fiscal  we completed an approximately million private placement of contingently convertible subordinated notes due notes 
interest was payable in cash on june th and december th of each year beginning june  under the terms of the offering  the notes could be convertible into shares of emulex common stock at a price of per share at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events

table of contents direct sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively  and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models

net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory for fiscal  domestic net revenues decreased by approximately million to million from million in fiscal for fiscal  international net revenues pacific rim and europe and rest of the world increased by approximately million to million from million in fiscal our net domestic and international revenues based on billed to location were as follows net domestic and international revenues percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands domestic pacific rim europe and rest of the world total net revenues we believe the higher growth rate in net international revenue was mainly due to an increase in products being sourced by our customers to locations outside the united states combined with the increase in esp revenues  which is mainly sourced to international locations 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 

table of contents gross profit

also included in cost of sales for fiscal is a million impairment charge compared to a million impairment charge recorded during fiscal the fiscal impairment charge was related to a developed technology intangible asset from the aarohi acquisition 
the initial value ascribed to this developed technology intangible asset was based primarily on forecasted revenues from products we no longer plan to place into production 
we recorded this impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of this developed technology intangible asset to the estimated fair value of zero 
further  approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
fiscal cost of sales included approximately million related to the mark up to fair value on inventory acquired in the sierra logic acquisition and subsequently sold  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
in addition  the company recorded an approximately million charge in fiscal compared to an approximately million charge for excess and obsolete inventory primarily associated with older generation hsps in fiscal gross margin increased to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal primarily due to our focused efforts on consolidating and streamlining our supply chain  higher dual channel product mix which has a higher gross margin  and the items discussed above 
we anticipate gross margin will trend down over time as lower gross margin but higher volume products such as mezzanine cards for blade servers and embedded storage products become a bigger portion of our business 
also  as our customers migrate from purchasing our products through the distribution channel and toward purchasing our products through oem server manufacturers  which have a lower selling price  our gross margin may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if inflation negatively impacts our suppliers  it may increase our product costs and if we are unable to pass it onto our customers  it may negatively impact our gross margin as well 
engineering and development

engineering and development headcount increased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal this expanded headcount resulted in an increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses 
the remaining incremental increase in engineering and development expenses during fiscal were primarily related to increases in expensed software costs of approximately million  prototype expenses and third party fees paid to consultants of approximately million  and fiscal included a full year of the sierra logic acquisition 
we will continue to invest in engineering and development activities and anticipate gross dollar expenditures will continue to grow in this area

our in process research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands in process research and development percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and recorded approximately million for purchased ipr d expense for the sierra logic acquisition during fiscal this charge was partially offset by purchase price allocation revisions of approximately million related to the aarohi acquisition 
we recorded approximately million for purchased ipr d expense for the aarohi acquisition during fiscal there may be additional future adjustments to ipr d related to the sierra logic acquisition as the purchase price allocation is being finalized 
nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net  consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense  and other non operating income and expense items 
nonoperating income  net percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change our nonoperating income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased approximately million  or 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to an investment in an early stage  privately held  company in the storage networking industry in fiscal the reduction in interest income was mainly due to lower cash and investment levels resulting from the cash paid for the aarohi and sierra logic acquisitions  the retirement of the notes  and the repurchases of our common stock 
additionally  the overall decrease in nonoperating income  net  was partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of the retirement of the notes in fiscal income taxes 
income taxes for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands income taxes percentage of net percentage of increase percentage revenues net revenues decrease points change income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased approximately million  or 
the effective tax rate increased slightly to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the nondeductible sierra logic ipr d expense of approximately million and the increase in the valuation allowance that was partially offset by the retroactive extension of the federal research tax credit during fiscal  and the resolution of tax audit contingencies in which the statute of limitations on previously open tax years expired 
the research tax credit had previously expired at the end of calendar critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those 
table of contents that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
changes in judgments and uncertainties could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangibles and other long lived assets  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured basic revenue recognition criteria 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to the distributors when the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and various other marketing programs 
moreover  we account for these incentive programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we classify the costs of these programs based on the benefit received  if applicable  as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
warranty 
we provide a warranty of between one and five years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of sierra logic  aarohi  and vixel are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from two to seven years 
furthermore  we assess whether our long lived assets including intangible assets  should be tested for recoverability periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 

table of contents goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fiscal fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
as of june   we have a valuation allowance of approximately million established against capital loss carryforwards 
on july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for additional information and related disclosures 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we used the modified prospective transition method when we adopted sfas no 
r in fiscal year which provides for only the current and future period stock based awards to be measured and recognized at fair value 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award forfeiture rate 
the input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and our growth and diversification strategy for at the least the next months 
we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credit or other borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to fiscal of approximately million 
the net cash increase provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower inventories as a result of our focused efforts on consolidating and streamlining our supply chain in fiscal and lower accounts and other receivables due to the weakness from the distribution channel revenues at the end of fiscal  partially offset by lower net income 
investing activities yielded approximately million of cash during fiscal compared to cash used of approximately million during fiscal the current period addition to cash from investing activities was mainly due to timing of maturities of investments which were not reinvested  partially offset by higher property and equipment expenditures primarily for the facilities in roseville  california and engineering and development equipment 
we anticipate continued higher property and equipment expenditures in the future as we continue our growth and diversification strategy 

table of contents cash used in financing activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to cash used during fiscal of approximately million

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of june   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
as of june   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities of approximately million 
also  we do not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of june  we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future
