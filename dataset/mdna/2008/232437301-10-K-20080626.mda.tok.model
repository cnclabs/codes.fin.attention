our products are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods  nutritional supplements and animal nutrition markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers  and direct consumer sales 
the company manufactures its products in hawaii  but markets them worldwide  generating  and of its revenues outside of the united states for each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  the company is influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which its customers operate  including adherence to its customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
the company currently has no material foreign exchange exposure as all sales are in us currency 
the company reported a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for fiscal compared to  or per diluted share for fiscal year cash and cash equivalents at march  were  down  from a year ago 
working capital declined to  at march  from working capital of  a year ago  primarily due to decreased cash and equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the following table details selected financial data highlighting three key areas year ended march  in thousands net sales spirulina products    natural astaxanthin products    other products gross profit as a percentage of sales operating expenses as a percentage of sales net sales for fiscal were  or higher than the  reported for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to increased production of both astaxanthin and spirulina compared to during fiscal  the company continued to experience reductions of naturose astaxanthin sales to the worldwide aquaculture market compared to fiscal accordingly  beginning the second quarter of fiscal  the company handled all former cyantoech japan business through cyanotech corporation headquarters 
also  as discussed in this report  the company dissolved its cyanotech japan subsidiary in november astaxanthin production during fiscal has primarily been used to produce higher value and higher margin bioastin products rather than naturose 
the company s emphasis is on growing the market for its human nutrition astaxanthin product  bioastin and spirulina products 
the company may invest in focused expenditures in advertising and clinical trials in the human nutrition and cosmetics markets and may work with industry leaders to integrate bioastin into other distribution channels and products 
the company intends to grow the human focused side of its spirulina business and to emphasize the benefits of its natural astaxanthin products as increased competition from other producers of natural and synthetic astaxanthin may result in the decline of margins generated by its natural astaxanthin products 
management cannot predict whether the outcomes of any of its strategies will be successful 
as depicted in the preceding table  the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal and consistent with for fiscal management expects the company s gross profit margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal to remain consistent with fiscal reported performance levels 
there are many factors which have influenced gross profit 
these particularly include sales volume and mix and below normal capacity due to both customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin production in and spirulina production in the third quarter of additional factors impacting current margins include competitive pricing results due to increased competition and increases in raw materials and related freight costs 
spirulina production during fiscal was particularly impacted by dilution and overflow problems as a result of torrential rains during re inoculation of ponds recovering from chemical imbalance as announced december  following the december restoration effort  this particular imbalance appears to be resolved 
astaxanthin production  which was impaired in fiscal year  appears to have returned to more reliable levels 
spirulina and astaxanthin production should continue at more reliable levels  resulting in reasonable per unit production costs 
however  because complex biological processes are involved and these processes are influenced by factors beyond company control the weather  for example we cannot assure the results of any of the company s corrective or improvement efforts 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain reasonably strong production volumes in order to support the basic resource levels required to sustain a large scale  open culture  natural agricultural facility 
the production of our algae products involves complex agricultural systems with inherent risks including weather  disease  and contamination 
these risks are unpredictable and also include such elements as the control and balance of necessary nutrients and other factors 
the efficient and effective cultivation of microalgae requires consistent light  warm temperatures  low rainfall and proper chemical balance in a very nutrient rich environment 
if the chemical composition of a pond changes from its required balance  unusually high levels of contamination due to the growth of unwanted organisms or other biologic problems do occur 
these often arise without warning and sometimes there are few or no clear indicators as to appropriate remediation or corrective measures 
we believe that our technology  systems  processes and favorable growing location generally permit year round harvest of our microalgal products in a cost effective manner 
however  imbalances in astaxanthin production in fiscal year and spirulina production in  together with increasing energy costs  suggest a need for continuing caution 
we cannot  and do not attempt to  provide any form of assurance with regard to our technology  systems  processes  location  or cost effectiveness 
the company operates entirely in one operating segment  the cultivation and production of microalgae into high value  high quality natural products 
the company cultivates  on a large scale basis  two microalgal species from which our two major product lines  spirulina products and natural astaxanthin products  are derived 
there is risk in operating entirely in one business segment such as the cultivation and production of microalgae at a single production facility 
single location agricultural and production facilities do not provide the protections and assurances afforded by operations in two or more widely separated locations 
our single location in hawaii is susceptible to increased energy and transportation costs  and energy and transportation disruptions with either limited alternatives or no alternatives 
the company s most significant operating expenditures are for electricity  related water pumping and nutrient and supply costs 
these costs are directly or substantially affected by the price of fuel oil since hawaii has virtually no hydroelectric power resources and only limited alternative electrical energy resources 
also  a single agricultural facility provides limited biologic diversity protection against invasive  mutant  or harmful organisms 
the company expects its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal to remain comparative to fiscal in both gross margin and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  as a specific level of improvement can not be determined 
the decrease in gross profit margin percentage between fiscal and was primarily due to reduced astaxanthin production and a change in sales mix 
the company will continue to contain discretionary spending  and is actively pursuing methods of controlling increased energy and freight costs 
the company recorded a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million in fiscal year as a result of an analysis required under sfas no 
due to current period losses combined with a history of losses  the company assessed the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
analysis as of march   however  no additional non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements was necessary for additional non cash impairment charges are not expected for if future planned results are achieved 
to offset increased production costs  the company continues to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
results of operations revenues net sales for fiscal totaled  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal and a increase from net sales of  reported in fiscal the following is a discussion of revenues by major product category 
spirulina the company has been producing spirulina pacifica  a strain of spirulina microalga  since revenues generated from the company s spirulina products are a significant portion of total revenues  amounting to   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
although the company believes that spirulina is a mature product in a highly competitive market  the dollar amount of revenue as a percentage of total revenues for the three years ended march   is  and  respectively 
approximately  or of net sales for the year ended march  were to spirulina international b 
v  a spirulina marketing and distribution company based in the netherlands 
sales to this customer during fiscal years and amounted to  or of net sales  and  or of net sales 
the company has experienced increased competition for its spirulina products resulting from an increasing number of suppliers of spirulina as well as from a larger portion of our sales coming from bulk product orders whose customers generally treat these products as commodities with price being the major determining factor driving their purchasing decision 
we expect this competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and in response have focused on improving the quality of our spirulina products in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
fiscal spirulina sales decreased  or resulting from fewer units sold as a result of third quarter production issues  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  sales decreased from resulting from average units sold and average unit price decreases of and  respectively 
at march  our backlog of spirulina orders totaled approximately  and such backlog at the end of fiscal was  the majority of these orders were filled in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
natural astaxanthin in fiscal  the company s sales of its natural astaxanthin products were  an increase of from  in fiscal  and an increase of from  in fiscal the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for the year was the result of a increase in units sold offset by a decrease in average selling price as compared to decreased production in accounted for the sales decline from customers  valensa and yad international accounted for  or of net sales and  or of net sales  respectively  for the year ended march  we believe that sales to these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net sales in future periods 
during  the company discontinued production of its animal product  naturose  in order to focus on the human astaxanthin products which are experiencing greater demand and have higher gross margins 
at march  our backlog of orders for all natural astaxanthin products totaled approximately  a decrease of  from  at the end of fiscal due primarily to the decreased production levels in and the timing of customer orders at the end of fiscal the majority of these orders were shipped in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
the company believes that the findings of clinical trials undertaken in prior years by the company  its customers and other unaffiliated parties  taken individually and on a cumulative basis  have generated growing consumer awareness of the beneficial antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties of astaxanthin 
validation of natural astaxanthin benefits identified in such scientific studies has helped to spur demand for our natural astaxanthin products in the human nutrition market and could provide the basis for proprietary intellectual property 
the company completed and issued reports on two positive scientific clinical trials on natural astaxanthin during fiscal one study demonstrated that natural astaxanthin could lower levels of c reactive protein  an indicator of systemic inflammation and the second study showed that grip strength could be increased in those suffering from tennis elbow by consumption of natural astaxanthin 
the company plans to continue expenditures on targeted scientific trials in the future in accordance with its strategy to increase sales of natural astaxanthin products 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was at  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of nutrients and materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  depreciation and amortization of production equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements associated with the production of inventory units sold and other production related period costs 
the cost of sales percentage decrease of points between and is due primarily to both customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin and spirulina production 
factors also include increases in the cost of raw materials and freight costs  as well as diminished demand for these products and including unabsorbed related fixed production costs 
astaxanthin production during fiscal was particularly impacted by an imbalance in the complex biological processes and mechanisms involved in its growth and production 
the company feels that it identified and corrected the factors leading to this particular imbalance 
however  because complex biological processes are involved  as discussed elsewhere in this report  the company cannot predict the magnitude or results of such corrective efforts 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to increase astaxanthin production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale open culture agricultural facility 
labor and chemical costs  coupled with other efforts  were not effective in correcting the imbalance in the factors affecting the company s biological cultivation process 
in fiscal   of non inventoriable costs were deemed to be period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of chemical  labor and utilities expended to manage the spirulina production problems  re inoculation and subsequent flooding which occurred in december these expenditures combined to significantly increase cost of sales relative to units produced and correspondingly reduced gross profit for the year ended march  fiscal year included  of non inventoriable costs as a result of abnormal chemical  labor and utility usage related to astaxanthin production coupled with costs associated with the company s animal nutrition market products which were not inventoriable because such costs would have exceeded the market value for the related inventory 
on march   the company announced its decision to abandon the animal nutrition market in favor of human products with higher demand and margins 
comparable non inventoriable costs recorded in fiscal totaled  for fiscal  with the rising cost of fuel oil  the company expects to incur higher electrical utility costs dependent upon the regulated public utility s ability to obtain approval for rate increases 
if electrical utility costs increase significantly from fiscal  the cost to manufacture the company s products could increase materially above prior year costs 
fresh water is critical for our natural astaxanthin production and  while the company has not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  the company recycles fresh water where possible and developed additional water recycling systems during fiscal in its efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
both fresh and sea water require electricity for pumping  and electricity  the company s single greatest expenditure  depends on the cost of fuel oil which is  in turn  tied to the global price of crude oil 
the general price of fuel in hawaii has increased in excess of since the end of fiscal and the company s cost of electricity has increased per kilowatt hour 
for the production of bioastin  the company s natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  three third party contractors are utilized for the processes of extraction  and three third party contractors are utilized for both encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets 
although these services are available only from a limited number of sources  we believe we have the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services and none are now anticipated 
to offset increased production costs  the company seeks ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the provisions of sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter require that abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on cost of sales 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  and changes in processing or production methods 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased points to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal and consistent with for fiscal as previously described 
management expects the company s fiscal gross profit margin percentage to remain generally consistent with the results reported for fiscal since astaxanthin cultivation and spirulina production variables are not expected to negatively impact gross margins in fiscal to the extent experienced in fiscal and more so in however  as discussed elsewhere in this report  the company cannot predict future production levels 
in fiscal  the company recognized period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of nutrients  labor and utilities engaged to restore production which were not immediately effective in correcting imbalances in the astaxanthin cultivation and spirulina production processes 
producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires the tenuous balancing of numerous factors including microalgal strain variations  temperature  acidity  nutrient and other environmental considerations  some of which are not in the company s control 
as a result  especially for natural astaxanthin cultivation  and also for spirulina production  it is difficult and time consuming to adjust  improve or correct the production process when quality levels fall below specifications 
while the company generally possesses scientific knowledge and resources to correct its production processes  there are too many variables involved for the company to make reliable projections concerning such efforts 
however  we have identified some production variables  and as a result  we constantly strive to correct imbalances in our efforts to achieve increased production yields in both quantity and quality 
in addition to the items discussed above  there are many factors which could materially diminish gross profit 
these include  but are not limited to sales volume and mix  increases in the cost of raw materials and raw material freight costs  and production volumes below normal capacity in response to customary production variables such as weather and significant changes in demand for the company s products  and the allocation of production resources toward astaxanthin and spirulina biomass production levels and production rates based on the variables just mentioned 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the point decrease from to as a percentage of sales and the point increase from to as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to two factors both occurring in the company recorded a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million as a result of an analysis required under sfas no 
in addition  the company incurred general and administrative expenses in conjunction with the restatement and amendment of a prior period annual report on form k a  for the fiscal year ended march   filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  in addition to these factors  there were costs incurred during the third quarter of fiscal meeting listing requirements with nasdaq capital market  including our one for four reverse stock split  as discussed in our december   form q filing with the securities and exchange commission on march  during fiscal  general and administrative expenses were comparable to fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased by from  and research and development decreased from in december  the company announced the lay off of staff  approximately percent of the company s workforce  representing reductions made throughout production and administration personnel 
this workforce reduction was intended to better balance costs with sales in the current sales and production environment 
the company is committed to ongoing cost containment aimed at controlling its level of operating expenses  but may increase some discretionary spending in future periods as dictated by the needs of the business 
research and development costs decreased to  in  down from  in fiscal  and down from  in fiscal no new clinical trials were conducted in and research and development efforts focused on resolving and improving culture and production processes 
in fiscal the major expenditures in research and development were for initiation of new scientific clinical trials  costs related to product registration and work aimed at increasing production yields and improving the quality and stability of such products 
sales and marketing costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing from fiscal and from fiscal consistent with efforts to control expenses  marketing was targeted toward sales of bulk bioastin and other related consumer products 
general and administrative costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal expenses increased only from one year ago 
compared to fiscal  fiscal expenses increased by  or due primarily to costs incurred for restatement of prior year s annual report on form k a as of march   and the work associated with the threatened nasdaq capital market delisting issues resulting in increases in audit  attorneys  accountants and other financial fees totaling a combined  such fees were substantially reduced in  however  they were offset by increased personnel and regulatory compliance reporting expenses 
the company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis under sfas no 
at march  determined that the company s equipment and leasehold improvements are not impaired in the cyanotech s consolidated balance sheet at march  however  such analysis under sfas no 
at march  determined that the company should record a non cash impairment loss reducing  by million  the values of certain production related equipment and leasehold improvement assets at march  accordingly  the values of the company s equipment and leasehold improvement assets as reported on the consolidated balance sheets as of march  were reduced by the impairment loss  and the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  includes the corresponding charge of million for the impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company notes that the foregoing reduction of asset carrying values significantly and correspondingly reduced depreciation expense in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charge 
the company expects operating expense spending will remain consistent with or moderately increase from fiscal due to increased personnel costs and general price increases of expenses 
increases may be necessary in research and development as new opportunities arise 
however  the company will continue to seek additional leverage from customer supported research where and as practicable 
increases in sales and marketing expenses may become necessary as the company seeks new and increased markets and market share 
whether sales and marketing expenses increase over fiscal year levels will be based on customer demand and market opportunities that may arise 
also  the cost of regulatory compliance including international standards iso  us food and drug manufacturing practice gmp  sarbanes oxley  and other regulatory compliance areas continue to increase 
finally  the company must remain competitive in the labor market  and this may lead to some increases in general and administrative costs 
other expense the following details the amounts included in other expense in thousands interest expense on term loan agreement other interest expense other income expense  net total other expense the total principal balance on the company s term loans was   and  as of march   and  respectively 
the interest rate under the term loans is above the prime rate 
the prime rate as of march   and was  and  respectively 
interest expense includes amortization of debt issue costs 
other income expense  net includes state sales tax expense related to prior years  interest earned on certain cash and cash equivalents balances and gains losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions of the company s japan subsidiary 
with the announced dissolution of the company s japan subsidiary  exchange rate fluctuations are not expected to continue as long as the company s business is transacted in us dollar amounts 
income taxes for fiscal the company recorded a tax expense of  compared with an income tax benefit of  and  respectively  for and these primarily related to hawaii state tax credits which were disallowed in fiscal at march  the company had federal and hawaii state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
these net operating loss benefits have been fully reserved as their utilization is not assured 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition at march   the company s working capital was  a decrease of  compared to  at march  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at march  totaled  a decrease of  from  at march  the decreases in working capital  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments are due to cash used in operating activities primarily resulting from significant increases in general and administrative costs previously discussed  and decreased balances in accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has two term loan agreements term loans with a lender 
these provided up to million in combined credit facilities which are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the outstanding combined balance under the term loans as of march  is approximately  the term loans have maturity dates of may  and march   respectively  and are payable in equal monthly principal and interest payments of approximately   of the combined term loans matures may   with the remaining  maturing march  the interest rate under the term loans  in absence of a default under the agreement  is the prime rate  as defined  in effect as of the close of business on the first day of each calendar quarter  plus the prime rate was at march  
at march  the company received a waiver of relevant restrictive covenants of the term loan related to the filings of forms q for fiscal year in addition  the company received a waiver of covenants related to delayed filing of its march  form k 
the company is prohibited by the term loan from declaring any cash dividends without the lender s prior written consent 
a  restricted cash deposit is held in an interest bearing restricted cash account per the terms of the term loan and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at march  and the following table presents the company s debt and lease obligations at march  in thousands less than year years years after years total term loans  interest expense on term loan operating leases   total    cash flows our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were   and  at march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company used cash in operating activities of  compared to cash used in fiscal of  and cash generated from operations of  in fiscal the additional cash used in operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to the fiscal net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal year which included non cash expenses of  coupled with the impact of accounts receivables and inventory decreases in totaling  and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets in amounting to  net cash of  was used in investing activities during fiscal this compared to net cash provided by investing activities in from the maturity of short term investments offset by equipment purchases 
such equipment purchases continue to be aimed toward capital projects enhancing or maintaining our ability to respond to market demand 
depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
depreciation expense for was significantly less than as a result of the non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements in for fiscal  management expects to continue to invest in equipment upgrades and leasehold improvements tied to market requirements and production efficiency 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate amounts expended in fiscal during fiscal  cash obtained from financing activities amounted to  proceeds from senior debt obtained february  as discussed in this report 
cash used in financing activities was  representing principal payments on long term debt and  of closing costs related to the february  senior debt 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and expected cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service  and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
with total working capital of million  and a current ratio of to as of march   management expects liquidity in fiscal to be generated primarily from operating cash flows 
the company has used estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching its conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future conclusions to vary significantly from those presented in this form k 
variability of results the following selected quarterly financial data unaudited as of and for the periods presented highlights the significant fluctuations in operating results and financial condition that the company has experienced in the past three fiscal years ended th quarter march  rd quarter december  nd quarter september  st quarter june  in thousands fiscal net sales     cost of sales     operating expenses   net income loss working capital     fiscal net sales     cost of sales     operating expenses   net income loss   working capital     fiscal net sales     cost of sales     operating expenses net income loss working capital     the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  governmental regulations and other factors beyond our control 
in addition  the company maintains product liability insurance only in limited amounts for products involving human consumption because broader product liability coverage is cost prohibitive 
a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
effect of recently issued accounting standards and estimates in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fin no 
on april  with no material impact to the financial statements  and believes the impact of fin no 
will not materially impact the company s results of operations for fiscal or beyond 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company regularly re evaluates its judgments and estimates which are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are inventory valuations  valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements and long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company recognizes revenues when goods are shipped fob shipping point and when significant risks and benefits of ownership are transferred 
the company is required to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is defined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location 
cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors  such as first in  first out  average cost  and last in  first out 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates first in  first out  or market 
inventory values are subject to many critical estimates  and unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on the company s results 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  changes in processing or production methods  and changes in the carrying value of our inventories resulting from the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products 
equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
self constructed leasehold improvements include design  construction and supervision costs 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to equipment and leasehold improvements when construction is completed and the facilities are placed in service 
if the company experiences impairment to its equipment or leasehold improvement  we would account for the impairment in accordance with sfas no 
pursuant to sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization shall be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
during the year ended march   the company recorded an impairment charge of  the company determined fair value based upon present values of expected future cash flows 
this technique requires the use of a variety of estimates including projected financial information  discount rates  as well as estimates of asset values many years in the future 
as such  the results from the use of this method can result in significant volatility in the results should any of these estimates or assumptions change 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
judgment is required in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
should the company generate sustained taxable income in the future  management may conclude that a portion or all of the existing valuation allowance is no longer required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have never entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments is not material 
we have a term loan agreement which adjusts quarterly based on the prime rate 
as such  we are exposed to the interest rate risk whereby a increase in the prime rate would lead to an increase of approximately  in interest expense for the year ending march  based on march  amounts outstanding
