the fund s primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory and management fees payable to the adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring investments 
the adviser provides the investment professionals of the adviser and the fund s administrator  equus capital administration company  inc  and their respective staffs  as well as access to the investment professionals of the administrator

table of contents 
index to financial statements december   the fund had invested the proceeds of borrowings on margin as discussed below under financing activities in short term  highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of us treasury bills  interest bearing bank accounts and certificates of deposit  that are  in the opinion of the adviser  appropriate for the preservation of the principal amount of such instruments 
the fund has maintained substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents since under certain circumstances  the fund makes follow on investments in some of its portfolio companies 
as of december   the fund had commitments to make million in investments in three existing portfolio companies 
the fund is committed to million in one or more debt securities to be issued by rp c international investments llc  million in healthspac  llc and million riptide  llc 
see portfolio companies rp c international investments llc  portfolio companies healthspac llc  and portfolio companies riptide llc below 
financing activities 
from time to time  the fund uses leverage to finance a portion of its investments 
the fund then repays such debt from the sale of portfolio securities 
under the act  the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue debt securities or preferred stock  which are referred to as senior securities  subject to certain restrictions including an overall limitation on the amount of outstanding debt  or leverage  relative to equity of because of the nature and size of the fund s portfolio investments  it periodically borrows funds to make qualifying investments in order to maintain its qualification as a ric 
during and  the fund borrowed such funds by accessing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
the fund invests the proceeds of these margin loans in high quality securities such us treasury securities until they are repaid 
the fund refers to these high quality investments as restricted assets because they are not generally available for investment in portfolio companies under the terms of borrowing 
if  in the future  the fund cannot borrow funds to make such qualifying investments at the end of any future quarter  it may not qualify as a ric and would become subject to corporate level income tax on its net investment income and realized capital gains  if any 
in addition  the fund s distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary dividends to the extent paid from earnings and profits 
see federal income tax considerations 
distributions 
the fund has a managed distribution policy 
the fund seeks to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders at an annualized rate equal to of the fund s market value  based on the year end closing share price of 
the fund s board of directors periodically will reassess the annualized percentage at which the fund s quarterly distributions will be made 
the board may change or terminate the managed distribution policy at any time  any such change or termination may have an adverse effect on the market price for the fund s shares 
the current policy has been in place since february the fund originally had a policy  adopted in october  to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders at an annual rate of a minimum of per share 
the fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of its dividends as possible from ordinary income net investment income and short term capital gains 
the balance of the dividend then comes from long term capital gains and  if necessary  a return of capital 
if the fund has taxable income and net capital gains in any fiscal year that exceeds the aggregate amount distributed in that year  the fund will make an additional special distribution in the amount of that excess after the close of that fiscal year 
the special distribution is required for the fund to maintain its ric tax status 
possible share repurchase 
as a closed end business development company  the fund s shares of common stock are not redeemable at the option of stockholders  and its shares currently trade at a discount to their net asset value 
the fund s board of directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of its stockholders to reduce or eliminate this market value discount 
accordingly  the fund has been authorized to  and may from time to time  repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock including by means of tender offers or privately negotiated transactions in an effort to reduce or eliminate this market discount or to increase the net asset value of the fund s shares 
the fund is not required to undertake any such share repurchases 

table of contents 
index to financial statements significant accounting policies valuation of investments the valuation of portfolio companies is the most significant area of judgment impacting the fund s financial statements 
the fund carries portfolio investments on its financial statements at fair value  with any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
the fund performs valuations of portfolio securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  and the financial reporting policies of the sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities 
the fund values investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded at their quoted market prices at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities  which the fund refers to as the valuation discount  if applicable 
as of december  and  the fund had no investments in publicly traded securities 
privately held portfolio securities 
the fund determines the fair value of investments for which no market exists on the basis of procedures established in good faith by its board of directors and based on input from the investment adviser and the fund s audit committee 
as a general principle  the fair value of an investment is the amount that the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective  and the estimated values arrived at by the fund s board of directors may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of specific portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor the fund uses to determine fair value until significant developments affecting a portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  the fund carries portfolio investments at appraised values as determined quarterly by the adviser  subject to the approval of the fund s board of directors 
the fund typically bases its valuations upon a multiple of each portfolio company s income and or cash flow  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  this appraisal may be based upon estimated liquidation value 
the fund typically appraises its common equity investment in each portfolio company at a multiple of the free cash flow generated by such company in its most recent fiscal year  less adjustments for outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
in some cases  the fund considers projections of current year free cash flow in its appraisals  and it may also consider an adjustment to the estimate of free cash flow for non recurring items 
the fund applies multiples based on the adviser s experience and recent transactions in the private company marketplace and cautions that these assessments are necessarily subjective in nature 
from time to time  the fund may elect to use third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis for its valuation of such company  although this is not the fund s typical approach to valuation 
this method of valuation is referred to as the private market method 
when an external event  such as a purchase transaction  public rights offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the fund applies the pricing indicated by such external event to corroborate its private equity valuation 
the fund generally uses the private market method only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
most of the fund s portfolio companies use leverage  which has the effect of magnifying its return or loss on investments 
for example  if a portfolio company has a total enterprise value of million and has million in funded indebtedness  the fund values its equity at million 
if the enterprise value of that portfolio company then increases or decreases by  to million or million  respectively  the value of the equity will increase or decrease by  to or million  as the case may be 
this disproportionate increase or decrease in equity value relative to total asset value adds a level of volatility to the fund s equity oriented portfolio securities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements from time to time  some of the fund s portfolio companies default in respect of covenants in their loan agreements 
when the fund has a reasonable belief that a portfolio company will be able to restructure its loan agreement to waive or eliminate such default or defaults  the fund continues to value its portfolio company s securities as a going concern 
if a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its debt or is not successful in refinancing its debt at maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on such portfolio company s assets or through reorganization or bankruptcy 
under such circumstances  the fund adjusts the value of its investment in the portfolio company accordingly 
the fund generally holds investments in debt securities to maturity 
accordingly  the fund determines the fair value of debt securities on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial condition of the issuer 
the fund values certificates of deposit at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
on a daily basis  the fund adjusts net asset value for changes in the value of publicly held securities  if any  and for material changes in the value of investments in securities issued by private companies 
the fund reports these amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly  and its daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes the fund intends to comply with the requirements of the code necessary for us to qualify as a ric 
so long as it complies with these requirements  the fund generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains distributed to stockholders 
therefore  the fund did not record a provision for federal income taxes in its financial statements 
as of december   the fund had no capital loss carry forward as it was fully utilized during the fund may borrow money from time to time to maintain its status as a ric under the code 
see overview financing activities above 
interest income recognition the fund records interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis to the extent that it expects to collect such amounts 
the fund stops accruing interest on investments when it determines that interest is no longer collectible 
if the fund receives any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible  it treats such cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid  before it recognizes any additional interest income 
the fund accretes or amortizes discounts and premiums on securities purchased over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discount and or amortization of premium on debt securities 
payment in kind interest the fund has loans in its portfolio that may pay pik interest 
the fund adds pik interest  if any  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain its status as a ric  the fund must pay out to stockholders this non cash source of income in the form of dividends even if it has not yet collected any cash in respect of such investments
