item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan emphasizes our visiting nurse operations 
our personal care operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
medicare revenue recognition on october   medicare implemented the prospective payment system pps and began paying providers of home health care at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below period base episode payment april  through december  january  through december  january  through december  january  through december  the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table vary  depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
under pps for medicare reimbursement  we record net revenues based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other related factors 
we record net revenues as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
prior to april  the company carried coverage with a deductible per claim of  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
as part of our on going risk management and cost control efforts  we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk  including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no 
as of december   we completed our impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
depending on level of sales  our liquidity and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation allowance was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
during the years ended december   and  based on changes in facts and circumstances  changes occurred in the company s expectations with regard to the generation of future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the state and local tax provision for  and included an increase reduction in recorded valuation allowances of approximately   and  respectively

acquired vn operations contributed approximately million of revenue in the remaining revenue growth came from locations in operation in both periods which in the aggregate grew approximately over revenue generated in pc operating income decreased due to lower gross margins 
interest expense is significantly higher due to increased usage of the revolving line of credit for acquisitions in ebitda increased between periods primarily due to revenue increases

this demonstrates both growth through acquisition and improvement of existing markets

gross margin remained constant between periods 
our general and administrative salaries and benefits increased predominantly as a result of the increase in the average number of locations in operation between periods substantially all of which were acquired  increases in wage rates and the addition of segment management staff driven by our focus on the execution of our strategic plan to develop the visiting nurse segment 
as a percent of revenue  these costs declined to from primarily due to increased volumes admissions  particularly in markets with no acquisition impact

direct margin decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in due to increased employee benefit costs  pay rates growing slightly faster than revenue rates and changes in mix of business toward lower margin markets and disciplines of care 
our volume of business and our business mix have been unfavorably impacted by changes in medicaid programs  particularly in ohio  which have caused a shift of patients away from traditional programs and toward managed care programs which typically pay lower rates and more stringently limit utilization of services per patient

liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility 
the company has a million credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na as amended november   with an expiration date of june  the credit facility bears an interest rate option at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  currently  or one month libor plus a margin ranging from to dependent upon total leverage and is secured by substantially all assets and the stock of the company s subsidiaries

borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development and growth of the business and other corporate purposes 
as of december   the formula permitted approximately million to be used  of which million was outstanding 
the company has irrevocable letters of credit  totaling million outstanding in connection with its self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was available for use at december  the company s revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of its covenants  the company is required to maintain minimum net worth of at least million 
the company believes that this facility will be sufficient to fund its operating needs for at least the next year 
the company will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in the company  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 
medicare reimbursement regulations for in august the centers for medicare medicaid services cms published final regulations updating and revising the medicare prospective payment system for home health hh pps for the final rule 
the final rule became effective on january  under the hh pps providers are reimbursed on the basis of a day episode following a formula dependent upon  among other factors  the patient s medical condition  the number of visits performed in the episode and the locale in which the patient resides 
the following are the more significant changes included in the final rule a market basket rate increase of to the episodic payment rate for a decrease in the episodic payment rate of for each of the years through and a decrease of for the case mix creep adjustment 
this rate cut was rationalized by cms in the regulations as offsetting coding increases from through that cms believes are not related to changes in the underlying health of patients 
the national day episodic payment rate for was  and for will be  reflecting both the market basket increase and the rate cut described above as well as certain other adjustments the more significant of which are described below 
a move from different patient driven coding categories home health reimbursement groups or hhrgs to hhrgs 
establishment of eight different break points in therapy visit thresholds used to determine reimbursement related to therapy services 
in reimbursement will change at each of the following visit thresholds       and visits 
in there was a single threshold at therapy visits 
a small increase in the reimbursement provided for certain episodes in which or fewer visits are provided 
a corresponding and offsetting adjustment was made to the national payment rate described above 
segregation of the reimbursement for non routine medical supplies based on a new formula separate from the national payment rate 
a corresponding and offsetting adjustment was made to the national payment rate described above 
a revision in the reimbursement formula provided for certain episodes in which a high number of visits is required to meet the needs of the patient 
this revision results in a decrease in the amount of reimbursement for these episodes 
a corresponding and offsetting adjustment was made to the national payment rate described above 
we believe the final rule will have the following implications the case mix creep adjustment for years will put downward pressure on margins in the home health industry and in our visiting nurse segment 
the extent of the downward pressure will be influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to future wage rate inflation  transportation costs  demand for and availability of clinicians  market basket increases and further changes to medicare reimbursement made by either cms or congress 
outcome of the refinements to the case mix formula will be dependent upon the type and needs of the patients actually seen in  and the clinical and other aspects of the care plans employed to care for those patients  all of which may differ from those experienced historically 
within the framework of providing the highest quality outcomes for our patients  we expect to take actions in response to the changing reimbursement environment with the goal of improving our clinical  operational and marketing efficiencies 
we believe the increased complexity of the reimbursement environment  combined with the long term effect of the case mix creep adjustment  will likely increase the supply of acquisition candidates available to us 
medicaid reimbursement we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of ohio  kentucky  connecticut  massachusetts  florida  alabama and illinois  respectively 
approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  many of which periodically face significant budget issues 
the financial condition of the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical and many may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made limiting reimbursement rate increases increased utilization of self directed care alternatives shifting beneficiaries from traditional coverage to medicaid managed care providers changing regulations under which providers must operate the actions that might be taken or considered are because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of the budget 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
acquisitions over the next three to five years we will actively seek to acquire quality providers of medicare certified home health services like our current visiting nurse segment operations 
we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
acquisitions during during the company acquired visiting nurse branch locations 
these operations added to our market presence in florida and ohio 
on october  the company acquired the assets of all the medicare certified home health agencies owned and operated by quality of life holdings  inc quality of life for an initial purchase price of million  consisting of million cash  and million or approximately  shares of almost family common stock restricted 
additional consideration of up to million may be paid contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain development targets following the closing 
the cash portion of the transaction paid at closing was funded from borrowings available on the company s senior credit facility 
the acquired operations generated net revenues of approximately million in the year ended december  on january   the company acquired the fixed assets and business operations of a home health agency with one personal care branch and one medicare certified branch located in jacksonville  florida 
the total purchase price of  was paid in cash 
the company assumed employee paid time off liabilities of approximately  and fixed assets of approximately  with the purchase price balance recorded as goodwill approximately 
the cash portion of the transaction was funded from borrowings available on the company s senior credit facility 
the acquired operations generated net revenues of approximately million in the year ended december  acquisitions during during  the company acquired visiting nurse branch locations  one of which was essentially a startup operation 
these operations added to our market presence in florida  and gave us market presence in alabama  illinois and missouri 
on december   the company acquired all the medicare certified home health agencies owned and operated by mederi  inc  located in coconut grove  florida 
the total purchase price of million was paid million in cash  approximately million or  shares of almost family common stock restricted and million in the form of two notes payable bearing interest at payable quarterly with the principal due in a balloon payment two years from the closing date 
the company assumed employee paid time off liabilities of approximately  and a medicare liability of approximately million 
approximately million of additional consideration was accrued as of december  and paid in march pursuant to the acquisition agreement based on achievement of certain targets in additional consideration of up to million in cash may be paid to the seller contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in the cash portion of the transaction was funded from borrowings available on the company s senior credit facility 
the acquired operations generated net revenues of approximately million in the year ended june  the mederi acquisition significantly expanded the company s presence and penetration in the state of florida and gave the company new market presence in the states of missouri and illinois 
on september   the company acquired the business operations of a medicare certified home health agency located in ft 
lauderdale  florida 
the total purchase price of million was paid million in cash with the  balance in the form of a note payable bearing interest at payable quarterly which was paid in full in the company funded the cash portion of the purchase price from available cash on deposit 
on june   the company acquired all the assets and business operations of a medicare certified home health agency located in birmingham  alabama 
the total purchase price of  was paid  in cash and  in the form of a note payable bearing interest at payable quarterly which was paid in full in the remaining  is comprised of assumed employee time off liabilities 
the company funded the cash portion of the purchase price from available cash on deposit 
on april   the company acquired all the assets and business operations of a medicare certified home health agency with branches located in ocala and palm coast  florida 
the total purchase price of million was paid million in cash with the  balance in the form of a note payable bearing interest at payable quarterly with the principal balance due in a balloon payment months from the closing date 
the remaining  is comprised of assumed employee time off liabilities 
the company funded the cash portion of the purchase price from available cash on deposit 
cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows net change in cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenue outstanding were at december  and at december  the cash used in investing activities is primarily due to acquisitions completed in and capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from stock option exercises  net repayments of the revolving credit facility and the payment of notes payable from acquisitions in and the company s stock option plans permit optionees to have option shares withheld on exercises in lieu of taxes which is shown in the cash flow statement as a repurchase of shares in the amount of million 
the company receives a current tax deduction for compensation expense subject to irs limits 
such deductions related to stock option exercises in the march quarter  is shown in the cash flow statement as a cash inflow of approximately  compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenues outstanding were at december   and at december   primarily due to a slow down in the processing of claims in acquired operations as they are converted to our information system 
the increase in combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in insurance liabilities  accrued accounts payable and accrued taxes 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from the acquisition of home health agencies 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the borrowings on our credit facility for the current year acquisitions 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt and additional consideration on mederi acquisition amounts in thousands total revolving credit facility capital lease obligations additional consideration on mederi acquisition notes payable operating leases total we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letter of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
discontinued operations we follow the guidance in sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during  the pc segment had three facilities and during  the vn segment had one facility that met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations 
for all the years presented in this report  these facilities have been reclassified 
net losses from the discontinued operations were approximately   and  in the years ended december   and respectively  and such amounts are included in net loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
non gaap financial measure the information provided in the some of the tables use certain non gaap financial measures as defined under securities and exchange commission sec rules 
in accordance with sec rules  the company has provided  in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables  a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
ebitda ebitda is defined as income before depreciation and amortization  net interest expense and income taxes 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity 
management routinely calculates and communicates ebitda and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance  measure leverage capacity and debt service ability  and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value 
ebitda is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of continuing operations net income to ebitda year ended december  net income from continuing operations add back interest income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization amortization of stock based compensation earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings
