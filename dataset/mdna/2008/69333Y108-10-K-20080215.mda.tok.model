item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following section presents an overview of our restaurant concepts  our related growth strategy and challenges we face 
a summary of our financial results and our outlook are also presented 
our restaurants we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the asian niche pf chang s china bistro bistro and pei wei asian diner pei wei 
as of december   we owned and operated full service bistro restaurants that feature a blend of high quality  traditional chinese cuisine and attentive service in a high energy contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original bistro restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we own and operate all of our restaurants with the exception of one bistro restaurant located in honolulu  hawaii which opened in september under a joint venture arrangement in which we own a minority interest 
as of december   we also owned and operated quick casual pei wei restaurants that offer a modest menu of freshly prepared  high quality asian cuisine served in a relaxed  warm environment with friendly counter service and take out flexibility 
we opened our first pei wei restaurant in july in the phoenix  arizona area and have expanded the concept significantly since that time 
additionally  as of december   we owned and operated one taneko japanese tavern restaurant 
we plan to exit operation of this business and will not continue to develop taneko 
as a result  we are negotiating the sale of taneko s long lived assets which we anticipate will be finalized during the first quarter of fiscal as discussed in greater detail below 

table of contents our strategy our objective is to be the best operator of asian restaurants as viewed by our guests and our employees 
we aim to develop and operate a nationwide system of asian inspired restaurants that offer guests a sophisticated dining experience  create a loyal customer base that generates a high level of repeat business and provide superior returns to our investors 
to achieve our objectives  we strive to offer high quality asian cuisine in a memorable atmosphere while delivering exceptional customer service and an excellent dining value 
we are currently operating restaurants exclusively in the asian niche due in part to the rising popularity of asian cuisine  combined with a relatively lower level of organized competition in this segment compared to other popular cuisines such as mexican and italian 
we believe this creates a significant opportunity for us to both grow our existing restaurant sales and open new locations in new and existing markets 
we are selective when choosing our new restaurant locations and currently assess anticipated returns on invested capital at both an individual restaurant and market level when determining future development plans 
we seek an average unit level return on invested capital of percent for both of our concepts and plan to continue opening new restaurants to the extent that we continue to achieve our target rate of return 
our challenges the restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price value relationships  ambiance  service and location  and many existing restaurants compete with us at each of our locations 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food  quality of service  price and value  dining experience  restaurant location and the ambiance of the facilities 
additionally  the rising popularity of asian cuisine may result in increased competition from new asian branded concepts as well as non asian restaurants that may increase their asian inspired menu offerings 
in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  lifestyle trends and cost fluctuations 
in recent years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers dine out less frequently than in the past or have reduced the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
accordingly  we strive to continuously evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to help maintain and enhance the strength of our brands and remain fresh and relevant to our guests and maintain a high value to price perception 
during  we began implementation of a new chinese grill menu  mini desserts and additional lunch size menu offerings at the bistro 
in addition  we rolled out new plateware and uniforms at the bistro 
at pei wei  some of our new culinary offerings include the system wide addition of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies to round out the meal 
as a result of these and other initiatives  we have updated the menu offerings available to our guests and have injected our restaurants with an updated contemporary look and feel 
we also began implementing a number of new marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and drive sustainable guest traffic increases 
additionally  we are challenged to manage rising restaurant operating costs including increased labor costs resulting from recent and upcoming minimum wage legislation and higher commodities costs impacting our cost of sales 
our financial results in  we continued to experience the impact of a very difficult operating environment as consumers felt greater economic strain from overall macroeconomic conditions 
we saw reduced restaurant traffic as fewer guests visited our restaurants in than in the previous year and we encountered more intense cost pressures  particularly in the labor category 
the combined impact of reduced traffic and higher costs resulted in the deterioration of operating margins in our financial results include consolidated revenue growth of million or percent to billion  driven primarily by new restaurant openings  offset by a decline in comparable store sales at the bistro and flat comparable store sales at pei wei  
table of contents income from continuing operations increase of million or percent to million and an increase in diluted income per share from continuing operations of or percent to  loss from discontinued operations net of tax of million  including the impact of a million pretax asset impairment charge related to the planned sale of taneko s long lived assets  repurchase of million of our common shares for million at an average price of  and new bistro openings and new pei wei openings 
our results continued to be affected by concept growth during  particularly as the number of pei wei restaurants increased by percent during the year 
in total  during we incurred million or approximately per share in preopening expenses related to new bistro and pei wei restaurant openings 
as we continue to develop and expand our restaurant concepts at different rates  our financial results will be impacted by the mix of the number of restaurants in our concepts and the ratio of newer restaurants to more established restaurants within those concepts 
this is due to the different operating characteristics of our brands as well as variations in the economics of our new restaurants compared to our more seasoned restaurants 
development bistro we intend to open new bistros in we will continue our development in existing markets and plan to enter five new markets in we have signed lease agreements for the majority of our development planned for fiscal we intend to continue to develop bistro restaurants that typically range in size from  to  square feet  and that require  on average  a total cash investment of approximately million to million and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during pei wei a key factor in pei wei s performance is our success in new markets 
there are inherent risks in opening new restaurants  especially in new markets  for various reasons  including the lack of experience  logistical support and brand awareness in a new market 
these factors may result in lower than anticipated sales and higher than average expenses during the initial period of operation for new restaurants in new markets 
throughout fiscal and  we opened new pei wei restaurants of which were located in new markets 
partially as a result of the impact of these new openings  we have experienced lower average weekly sales and reduced operating margins 
in  we intend to slow our growth substantially and limit the number of openings in new markets through the development of new restaurants  primarily located in mature or under penetrated markets 
new pei wei restaurants in mature markets typically open at higher sales levels and greater profitability than those located in new or under penetrated markets 
under penetrated markets represent areas in which we do not have a significant number of stores and  as a result  we typically cannot maximize unit sales management and marketing which results in lower profitability levels 
we have historically experienced higher sales volumes for all restaurants in certain formerly under penetrated markets once we achieved greater store density and increased brand awareness 
we believe this development focus  together with our implementation of revised new restaurant opening procedures  will help to mitigate the overall risks associated with opening restaurants in new markets 
our pei wei restaurants are generally  to  square feet in size and require an average total cash investment of approximately  to  and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during we have signed lease agreements for the majority of our development planned for fiscal 
table of contents operating statistics there are several key financial metrics that can be useful in evaluating and understanding our business 
these metrics  which are widely used throughout the restaurant industry  include short term revenue measures such as average weekly sales and total revenues and long term profitability measures such as return on invested capital  each of which are described in further detail below 
we believe it is helpful to review these measures both in total and by class year ie  year of restaurant opening 
average weekly sales represents an average sales amount per restaurant and helps gauge the changes in traffic  pricing and brand development 
new restaurants are included in our average weekly sales comparison at the start of their thirteenth month of operation and therefore  growth in average weekly sales includes the effect of newer restaurants that are not yet included in the comparable store sales base 
we have grown our business over time and as a result  our older restaurants typically tend to operate at higher sales volumes than our newer restaurants 
alternatively  it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normal sales volumes and then experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 
total revenues by class year helps assess the sales performance of our new and existing restaurants as well as the growth of each concept as we continue our expansion strategy 
return on invested capital is a key profitability measure which provides an indication of the long term health of our concepts 
this metric is based on a comparison of operating profit to the average capital invested in our restaurants 
we believe return on invested capital is a critical indicator in evaluating our ability to create long term value for our shareholders 
the following table shows total revenues and average weekly sales for our company owned bistro and pei wei restaurants based on the year of opening revenues in thousands revenues average weekly sales year of unit opening units bistro pre total bistro pei wei total pei wei return on invested capital metrics are available on our website at www

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
partnership structure we utilize a partnership philosophy to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of our restaurants 
historically  this philosophy was embodied in a traditional legal partnership structure  which included capital contributions from our partners in exchange for an ownership stake in the profits and losses of our restaurants 
under this legal partnership program  each partner who wishes to participate in our legal partnership structure  to the extent applicable  is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
generally  no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant is owned in total by minority partners 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant  utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners is recognized as partner investment expense upon purchase by the partner of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value is recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over approximately years for our bistro restaurants and approximately years for our pei wei restaurants 
effective january for new store openings  the bistro began employing a different partnership structure to achieve the same goal 
at the restaurant level  our operating and culinary partners at stores opened on or after january  still partners in the philosophical  but not legal sense no longer have a direct ownership stake in the profits and losses of a restaurant  but are instead eligible to receive monthly incentive payments based upon the profitability of the restaurant  as well as participate in an incentive program that rewards improvements in the operating performance of the restaurant 
as a result of these changes  awards made to the individuals participating in the new plan are classified as compensation expense rather than as minority interest expense 
accordingly  compensation expense for these operating and culinary partners is reflected in the consolidated income statement as labor expense 
additionally  a similar structure exists for our market partners and regional vice presidents  with related compensation expense reflected as general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement 
partner investment expense is no longer recognized for new bistro restaurant openings beginning in as a result of this change 
additionally  many existing legal partners have requested an early buyout of their partnership interest during as a result of their desire to participate in the new plan  the financial impact of which is discussed under partner investment expense in results of operations 
the pei wei partnership structure is not affected by the changes at the bistro and the traditional partnership structure remains in effect for new pei wei restaurant openings 
lease obligation we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes 
table of contents renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as preopening expense 
beginning january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as preopening expense  in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not vest forfeitures 
we contract with a third party consultant who utilizes our historical data to validate our assumptions for option grants 
additionally  we use assumptions to estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to restricted stock in determining the share based compensation for these awards 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our estimates of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least annually 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this 
table of contents process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid to our insurance carrier amounts that approximate the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims 
we develop these estimates with our insurance providers and use historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
our self insurance liabilities are actuarially determined and consider estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our actual historical trends 
if actual claims experience differs from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our insurance reserves would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated income statements 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
on a quarterly basis  we review and update our inventory of tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain positions taken  or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have been adequately resolved 
additionally  uncertain positions may be re measured as warranted by changes in facts or law 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
changes in the tax contingency reserve result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could adversely affect our reported results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our tax contingency reserves

each segment contributed to current year revenue growth as follows bistro the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by new bistro restaurants that opened during combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during stores that opened prior to experienced a million decline in revenues due to a reduction in overall guest traffic which resulted in lower sales volumes  despite the benefit of a average check increase 
pei wei the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by the new pei wei restaurants that opened in combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during stores that opened prior to experienced a million increase in revenues due to higher guest traffic partially offset by a slight decrease in average check 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the cost of food and beverages 
each segment contributed as follows bistro cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased slightly primarily due to higher produce and dry food expense as well as the impact of our new grill menu items 
the increases were partially offset by lower seafood and pork expense resulting from favorable pricing  improved yields and increased purchasing through national distribution contracts 
pei wei cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at pei wei was consistent with the prior year primarily due to lower produce expense resulting from the increase in product availability  favorable yields and the number of products covered by contract pricing as well as lower pork expense resulting from favorable pricing and yields 
this impact was fully offset by increased dry food expense and the benefit of an adjustment recorded during the second quarter of resulting from a modification of our accounting policy related to rebate accruals 
labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items  workers compensation costs and imputed partner bonus expense 
imputed partner bonus expense represents the portion of restaurant level operating results that are allocable to minority partners  but which is presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro labor expenses as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased primarily due to higher management incentive costs principally resulting from the change in the bistro partnership structure  wage rate pressure impacting all hourly labor categories and the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor costs that is fixed in nature 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claims development 
pei wei labor expenses as a percentage of revenues at pei wei increased slightly primarily due to continued wage rate pressure in culinary positions  increased management incentive costs and the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor costs that is fixed in nature 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claims development 
operating operating expenses consist primarily of various restaurant level costs such as repairs and maintenance  utilities and marketing  certain of which are variable and fluctuate with revenues 
our experience to date has been 
table of contents that operating costs during the first four to nine months of a newly opened restaurant are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
each segment contributed as follows bistro operating expenses as a percentage of revenues at our bistro restaurants increased slightly when considering an adjustment resulting from a modification of our accounting policy related to utility accruals during the second quarter of excluding the impact of this adjustment  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to costs related to the system wide rollout of a new safety program initiative as well as higher utilities costs and the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature 
pei wei operating expenses as a percentage of revenues at our pei wei restaurants increased including an adjustment resulting from a modification of our accounting policy related to utility accruals during the second quarter of excluding the impact of this adjustment  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to an increase in marketing spend  the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature and higher utilities costs  partially offset by reduced take out supplies and menu printing costs 
occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property and general liability insurance and property taxes

as a percentage of revenues  bistro s general and administrative costs were consistent with the prior year 
pei wei general and administrative costs at pei wei increased primarily due to an increase in compensation expense related to the addition of development and operating partners as well as our new pei wei chief operating officer  increased health insurance costs  higher management incentive accruals  greater travel related expenses and increased share based compensation expense 
as a percentage of revenues  pei wei s general and administrative costs decreased compared to the prior year due to improved leverage resulting from the impact of an expanded store base 
shared services and other general and administrative costs for shared services and other increased million or percent principally due to higher compensation and benefits expense  primarily related to the addition of corporate management personnel  and increased share based compensation expense 
this increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and reduced legal expenses 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  gains and losses on disposal of assets and the amortization of intangible assets and non transferable liquor license fees 
each segment contributed as follows bistro depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization on restaurants that opened during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  costs related to our new plateware and grill menu initiatives

additionally  total preopening costs per restaurant increased slightly during fiscal compared to the prior year 
pei wei preopening expense increased primarily due to the impact of opening new pei wei restaurants during fiscal compared to new pei wei restaurants during fiscal  as well as the impact in of the timing and number of restaurants scheduled to open during early fiscal compared to the impact in of early fiscal openings 
additionally  total preopening costs per restaurant increased slightly during fiscal compared to the prior year 
partner investment expense partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants and our partners cash contributions for those ownership interests 
additionally  for those partners who are bought out prior to the end of a specific term generally five years  partner investment expense includes a reversal of previously recognized expense for the difference between the fair value of the partner s interest at inception date and the fair value at the date of repurchase  to the extent that the former is greater 
each segment contributed as follows bistro partner investment expense at the bistro decreased due to the change in partnership structure discussed previously  which led to a significant increase in early buyouts of minority partner interests during fiscal these early buyouts resulted in a million reversal of previously recognized partner investment expense due to the fair value of the partner s interest at inception date exceeding the fair value of the partner s interest at repurchase date 
additionally  as a result of the change in partnership structure  partner investment expense is no longer recognized at the time a new bistro restaurant opens 
pei wei partner investment expense at pei wei increased primarily due to the impact of opening new restaurants during fiscal compared to opening new restaurants during fiscal these increases were partially offset by higher expense reductions related to minority partner buyouts and the impact of a lower imputed fair value of partnership interests in new pei wei restaurants in fiscal 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest expense recognized during fiscal primarily consists of interest costs in excess of amounts capitalized related to our outstanding credit line and other borrowings as well as accretion expense related to our conditional asset retirement obligations 
interest income earned during fiscal primarily relates to interest bearing overnight deposits 
consolidated interest and other income expense  net decreased primarily due to lower interest income resulting from the sale of interest bearing securities in late to fund our share repurchase program  combined with increased interest expense in resulting from greater interest incurred related to additional credit line borrowings  a portion of which exceeded our limit for capitalization during we expect to continue to recognize net interest expense during until such time as we lower our outstanding debt levels 
minority interest minority interest represents the portion of our net earnings which is attributable to the collective ownership interests of our minority partners 
as previously discussed  in many of our restaurants we employ a partnership management structure whereby we have entered into a series of partnership agreements with our regional managers  certain of our general managers  and certain of our executive chefs 
each segment contributed as follows bistro minority interest as a percentage of revenues at the bistro decreased due to the impact of partner buyouts occurring during fiscal these buyouts reduced the number of minority interests from interests as of december  to interests as of december  pei wei minority interest as a percentage of revenues at pei wei decreased due to the impact of lower restaurant net income and the impact of partner buyouts occurring during fiscal provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the income tax rates for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
the decrease in the effective rate for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to an income tax benefit arising from state tax credits and state and federal net operating losses 
management has evaluated all positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of deferred tax assets and has determined that  with the exception of a small amount of state net operating losses  the company will recognize sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations  though we also borrow under our credit facility from time to time 
historically  our need for capital resources has primarily resulted from our construction of new restaurants 
in fiscal and  our need for capital resources was also driven by additional repurchases of our common stock and  in  repurchases of minority interests

we expect to spend approximately  per restaurant for preopening costs 
total cash investment per each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  to  and we expect to spend  per restaurant for preopening costs

future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and any potential repurchases of our common stock 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our current cash reserves and available credit lines  will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through and for the foreseeable future 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we cannot ensure that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all

we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood and produce 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
