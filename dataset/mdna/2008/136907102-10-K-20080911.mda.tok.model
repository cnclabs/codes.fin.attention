all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in itema 
risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  receivables valuation  valuation of investments  inventory valuation  depreciable lives of fixed assets  valuation of goodwill and acquired intangibles  income taxes  stock based compensation  and accrued warranties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of product to customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
revenue from service administered by us that is not covered by a service contract is recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we may sell products together with extended warranties or maintenance contracts 
the revenue recognized per element is determined by allocating the total sales price to each element  based on the relative fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
separately priced extended warranty and maintenance products are accounted for over the life of the contract 
unearned revenue is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we will also provide a general reserve based on the aging of the accounts and notes receivable based on historical experiences of write offs 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at june   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
as of june   our inventory of million is stated net of inventory reserves of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
fair value of financial instruments 
carrying amounts of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
held to maturity marketable securities  which are generally comprised of short duration certificates of deposit or government backed bonds  are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value 
available for sale securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis and the associated change is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability at june   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures 
table of contents or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we implemented the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin sab for all share based compensation that was not vested as of july  we adopted sfas no 
r using a modified prospective application  as permitted under sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this application  we were required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the fair value of each option stock appreciation rights sars award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model incorporating various assumptions 
expected volatility is determined using both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life of the options is based on historical observations adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options sars 
additionally  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the average risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury security rate with a term to maturity that approximates the option s expected life as of the grant date 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience as well as future expectations 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets in the event that realization of the assets is considered unlikely see note 
on july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as discussed more fully below 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also 
table of contents provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period see note 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  sell  distribute  and service lasers and light based products used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers and light based products principally to medical practitioners 
we market our products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
we generate our revenue from the sale of lasers  light based devices  and other products  and product related services 
we distribute products worldwide through our direct sales force and independent distributors 
we assemble substantially all of our products in our wayland  massachusetts  south plainfied  new jersey  and netanya  israel facilities in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in our first fiscal quarter due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
our products are generally covered by a standard warranty  with an option to purchase extended warranty contracts at the time of product sale or service contracts after the time of sale 
distributor sales generally include a parts warranty only 
the anticipated cost associated with the standard warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment as a cost of sales 
any costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of sales 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended service contracts  which are typically for a or month period  and the revenue is initially deferred and recognized over the life of the service contract 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors 
international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france  italy  spain  japan  israel and australia  and sales consisting of products shipped from the united states directly to international locations from the united states during the fiscal years ended june   june   and july  represented   and of total sales  respectively 
our fiscal year consists of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to june of each year 
the years ended june   june   and july  contained weeks each  respectively

revenue for the year ended june  was million as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the slight decrease is primarily related to the slowdown in our domestic market that is related to the current economic conditions which has been offset by growth in our international operations as well as our service area 
international revenue increased approximately million over the prior year and accounted for approximately of total revenue for fiscal as compared to approximately for fiscal this million increase  was net of an approximate million decreases in sales in latin america  which represents approximately a decrease in sales for that region 
sales in europe increased approximately  representing a million increase in europe as compared to fiscal year sales in our asia pacific area also had strong growth of approximately million 
product related service revenue increased approximately to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was consistent with the increase in systems sold over the past few years and increase in renewal contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately million to million  or of revenue  in fiscal year from million  or of revenue  in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit results from a shift in our revenue mix from domestic sales to more international 

table of contents international sales increased to approximately of our overall business in fiscal as compared to approximately in fiscal year international sales typically have lower gross margins since a greater proportion of that volume is sold through distributors as compared to domestically which are primarily sold through our direct sales force 
our product related services portion of our revenue increased to of our overall revenue in the current fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year the product related services typically carry a lower gross profit than our product revenue 
we also encountered certain product reliability problems during fiscal year that resulted in increased service related costs  thus eroding such margins further 
we believe we have identified the causes of these problems and will be implementing the necessary solutions in future periods 
research and development expense 
research and development spending decreased approximately million to million in fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was attributable primarily to the completion of approximately million of outsourced project related work which was part of the new product introduction initiative in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses were approximately and for fiscal years and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to approximately million or of revenue during fiscal year as compared to million or during fiscal year of the million increase legal expenses represent approximately million primarily related to our current lawsuits and approximately million was due to higher personnel expense for increased headcount and salary increases 
other income expense 
other expense was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to other income of approximately million for the same period ended june  the decrease is primarily due to the company having recognized a million gain on the initial exchange of common stock of solx  inc for cash and common stock of occulogix  inc 
during the fiscal year ended  as compared to the recognition of a million loss on the other than temporary impairment of our holdings of common shares of occulogix  inc during the fiscal year see note 
the decrease in interest income earned during the fiscal year ended  as compared to the fiscal year ended  is related to a decrease in market interest rates combined with an overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents and in marketable securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended compared to a effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  includes the effect of the changing mix of foreign and us pre tax income loss  the expiration of the research and experimentation credit  and other permanent items 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended july  revenue 
revenue for the year ended june  was million as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the slight decrease is primarily related to a decrease in volume of our legacy products and the inability to ship all the announced new products 
international revenue increased approximately million over the prior year and accounted for approximately of total revenue for fiscal as compared to approximately for fiscal this million increase  was net of an approximate million decreases in sales in latin america  which represents approximately a decrease in sales for that region 
sales in europe increased approximately  representing a million increase in europe as compared to the fiscal 
table of contents product related service revenue increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was consistent with the increase in systems sold over the past few years and increase in renewal contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately million to million  or of revenue  in fiscal from million  or of revenue  in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily driven by improvements in the overall product related service area 
these improvements were the result of the staffing efficiencies that were achieved through the world wide service organization and the increased service contracts 
research and development expense 
research and development spending increased approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to million of higher outsourced project related work utilized to expedite the completion of the new product introduction cycle  million of increased project materials expenditures related to the same  and million related to increased personnel expenses including share based compensation 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses were approximately and for fiscal and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to approximately million or of revenue during fiscal as compared to million or during fiscal of the million increase  million was due to higher personnel expense for increased headcount  higher commission expense due to increased commissionable revenue  and stock based compensation 
the increase is also attributable to a million increase in marketing related expenses such as customer related work shops  advertising  trade shows  and an increase of million due to an increase in legal and professional fees 
other income expense 
total other income increased approximately million for the fiscal to million  from approximately million for the fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the recognition of a million gain on the exchange of common stock of solx inc for cash and common stock of occulogix inc nasdaqgm occx 
the gain was a result of the acquisition of solx inc  a privately held company  by occulogix inc  a publicly traded company 
the company held of the outstanding common stock of solx inc on an as converted basis  prior to the merger 
as a result of the acquisition of solx  inc  the company received approximately million in cash plus approximately million shares of common stock in occulogix inc income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended june  compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended july  the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   includes a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated at the foreign subsidiaries at rates below that of the united states statutory tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities at june  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million at june  we continue to have no long term debt 
we believe that the combination of existing cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities on hand  along with cash to be generated by future operations and amounts available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  as it becomes required 
cash used by operating activities amounted to approximately million for the fiscal year ended as compared to million for the fiscal year ended this increase in cash used by 
table of contents operating activities was primarily due to our year to date net loss  the year over year growth in inventory  and the reduction in certain accrued liabilities  offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities in the normal course of business 
the increase in our inventory during the fiscal year ended results primarily from the addition of two new subsidiaries combined with our new product introductions 
cash provided by investing activities amounted to approximately million for the fiscal year ended as compared to million for the fiscal year ended this increase in cash provided by investing activities primarily reflects the net maturities of held to maturity investments 
cash used by financing activities amounted to approximately million for the fiscal year ended as compared to million for the fiscal year ended the decrease is directly related to the company repurchasing less of its own equity shares in the fiscal year ended as compared to the fiscal year ended debt instruments and related covenants we maintain a renewable  revolving credit agreement with a major bank with interest at the bank s base rate of libor plus 
any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are due on demand or according to a payment schedule established at the time funds are borrowed 
the line of credit is unsecured 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants limiting the establishment of new liens  and the purchase of margin stock 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of june  or june  off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and the license agreement with the regents 
the table below in the next section titled contractual obligations shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  we choose to lease our facilities and automobiles instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations in august  candela obtained exclusive license rights to the dcd from the regents  subject to certain limited license rights of cool touch  inc cool touch  in the following fields of use procedures that involve skin resurfacing and rejuvenation  vascular skin lesions  and laser hair removal 
cool touch  a subsidiary of new star technology  inc obtained a license to the dcd on a co exclusive basis with candela  in certain narrower fields of use 
cool touch is restricted in its ability to assign its license rights to certain existing competitors of candela 
candela is entitled to one half of all royalty income payable to the regents from cool touch 
under an amendment to the license agreement  candela no longer is required by the regents to negotiate sublicenses to third parties 
however  candela is entitled to one half of all royalties due from any other entity that licenses the dcd technology from the regents in other fields of use 
effective july   we amended certain portions of our agreement with the regents whereby for the annual license fee of million  our royalty obligation was reduced to from its prior level of 
the annual fee of million was paid by a lump sum of million and is being amortized over the remaining life of the patent agreement  which as of june  was approximately five years 
this reduced royalty rate and the amortization of the annual license fee payment is reflected in our financial statements as of june  the unamortized portion of the license fee payment is reflected in prepaid licenses in the june  balance sheet 
we recognized royalty expense associated with this patent of approximately million for fiscal year 
table of contents outstanding contractual obligations are reflected in the following table in thousands total less than year years years after years royalty commitments operating leases total contractual obligations we do not anticipate experiencing any significant increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits within the fiscal year ended the company has unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million at june  recent accounting pronouncements information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  us government securities and fixed income corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and those fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international subsidiaries that transact business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and variability in operating results due to fluctuation in exchange rates underlying the value of current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying transactions are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings generally in the same period as exchange gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables are recognized 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
we had three forward exchange contracts outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro denominated intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros at june  these contracts serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract outstanding at june  was approximately million resulting in a realized loss of approximately  the loss on the fair value of the derivative contract was largely offset by the gains on the underlying transaction
