overall sales volumes were up 
sales volume declined due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line which was more than offset by a increase in selling volumes of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the divested product line 
acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers 
sales volumes were also up another primarily due to increased capacity available following our takeover of the melamine manufacturing facility in august  which previously was a joint venture with a third party and higher demand levels for acrylonitrile

overall sales volumes are higher and selling prices are higher  both primarily related to acrylonitrile 
the divestiture of the acrylamide product line on october  reduced sales but was more than fully offset by increased sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylamide product line 
acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers  and our internal uses of acrylamide to make certain of our divested water treating chemicals were treated as intersegment sales 
after the divestiture  acrylonitrile used to make acrylamide is now a third party sale and for the year this added to sales 
after excluding the above  selling volumes increased from the prior year when volumes were adversely impacted due to plant shutdowns as a result of the hurricanes in the us gulf coast in the third quarter of on a regional basis selling volumes in asia pacific were down due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile for use in upgrading to acrylic fiber

in  we recorded total net restructuring charges of after tax  which were charged to expense as follows manufacturing cost of sales  and administrative and general of details of restructuring initiatives are as follows we decided to cease manufacturing of several mature products at our willow island  west virginia plant 
the discontinued products were part of the polymer additives business in our cytec performance chemicals segment 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of to manufacturing cost of sales primarily related to severance and other benefits for employees who are expected to be retained through may this charge also included the write off of excess raw materials and spare parts 
an additional restructuring charge of to manufacturing cost of sales is expected to occur in the first half of this relates to the remainder of the severance and other benefits which will be accrued as they are earned as well as decontamination expenses which will be expensed as incurred 
minimal savings from this restructuring initiative were realized in a one time cash benefit of from working capital reductions is expected to be realized through the first quarter of once all actions have taken place in  annualized before tax savings from these restructuring initiatives are projected to be these benefits are net of lost earnings due to an annual sales reduction of we also announced the restructuring of our liquid coating resins plant in wallingford  connecticut in order to exit a mature product line and consolidate and automate certain operations at the site 
liquid coating resins are part of the cytec surface specialties segment 
we recorded a restructuring charge of to manufacturing cost of sales relating to severance and other benefits for employees 
an additional restructuring charge of is expected to be recorded in  primarily related to the remainder of the severance and other benefits which will be accrued as they are earned 
the economic benefit of this restructuring is derived from the combination of ceasing operations of one manufacturing line and supplying the volume on a consolidated operating basis 
a one time cash benefit of from working capital reductions is expected to be realized from this initiative  of which was realized in annualized before tax benefits of are projected to be realized beginning in as a result of this restructuring initiative  of which was realized in these benefits are net of lost earnings due to an annual sales reduction of asset retirements on both these projects will be recorded when production ceases and will be charged to the composite depreciation reserve in accordance with our accounting policy

in addition  a non cash charge of was recognized and cash payments of were incurred for the restructuring initiatives 
in  we recorded total restructuring charges of after tax in connection with several restructuring initiatives  including related asset impairments of after tax 
in the aggregate these costs were charged to expense as follows manufacturing cost of sales  selling and technical services  administrative and general  research and process development  and amortization of acquisition intangibles details of restructuring initiatives are as follows based on forecasted cash flow information  we determined that our manufacturing facility in dijon  france and related intangible assets were impaired 
this facility manufactured solventborne alkyd and solventborne acrylic based resins for our cytec surface specialties segment  which are used in the coating industry for sale in the european market 
these mature products were in a declining market with supplier overcapacity with severe price erosion and were generating losses 
we recorded an impairment charge of to write down the carrying value of the manufacturing facility and related intangible assets down to zero as we did not believe the assets were saleable and the outlook for recovery of products it manufactured was not positive 
also in  after the appropriate consultations with the works council  we decided to close the facility and commence shutdown activities 
at that time  we recorded a restructuring charge of  based on estimated severance costs for eliminating positions at our dijon  france manufacturing site 
in addition  we recorded a net restructuring charge of primarily for the severance costs for eliminating positions at our indian orchard  massachusetts site  and positions at our leased facilities in new castle  delaware  which operations have relocated to our new manufacturing facility in kalamazoo  michigan

liquidity and financial condition at december   our cash balance was compared with at year end cash flows provided by operating activities were compared with for a significant portion of the improvement over the prior year is attributable to increased earnings 
in  trade accounts receivables increased due to higher sales levels 
inventories increased due to higher overall raw material costs and  in the specialty materials segment  higher inventory levels to meet increasing demand 
other receivables decreased which includes payments received for certain supplier rebates of  and insurance and claim recoveries of other liabilities decreased principally due to contributions to our pension and post retirement plans net of accrued expenses of cash flows used in investing activities were for compared with cash flows provided by investing activities of for in  we received  net of cash transaction costs  for the completion of the first of three phases of the sale of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines

net cash flows used in financing activities were in compared with for the financing cash flows were driven by net debt repayments of and treasury stock repurchases of  shares for these were partially offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options of and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements of during  we had net debt repayments of  which were partially offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options of and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements of in june  we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement to increase the facility from to  and extend the maturity date to june there was no borrowing against the unsecured five year revolving credit facility at december  also at december   we had of non us credit facilities  with outstanding borrowings of non us in february  we announced the reinstatement of our stock buyback program authorized in approximately remained authorized under the buyback program as of that date 
in december  we completed that authorization and announced a new authorization to repurchase up to an additional of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   approximately remained authorized under our new stock buyback program 
the repurchases are made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and the shares obtained under this authorization are anticipated to be utilized for stock option plans  benefit plans and other corporate purposes 
as of december   our total debt of is denominated approximately in euros  in dollars and the balance in other currencies  after taking into account euro us dollar cross currency swaps 
during  we paid four quarterly cash dividends of per common share which aggregated on january   the board of directors increased the regular dividend rate by and declared a per common share cash dividend  payable on february  to shareholders of record as of february  we believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividends as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation 
however  from time to time  based on such factors as local tax regulations  prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments  it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements  which may include debt service related disbursements 
we have a scheduled debt payment due march   which we intend to repay using a combination of our cash and  if necessary  part of our unused revolver 
we have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company 
excluding the impact of increasing raw materials costs  inflation is not considered significant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a significant risk are limited

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows caption 
del december  buy sell us dollar euro pound sterling australian dollar canadian dollar others us dollar pound sterling japanese yen malaysian ringgit norwegian krone taiwan dollar others del 
the favorable fair value of currency contracts  based on exchange rates at december   was approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
in september   we entered into euro of five year cross currency swaps and euro of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the five year notes and ten year notes into euro denominated liabilities 
the swaps included an initial exchange of on october  and will require final principal exchanges of on each settlement date of the five year and ten year notes october  and october   respectively 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us dollars to counterparties and received euros 
upon final exchange  we will provide euros to counterparties and receive us dollars 
the swaps also call for a semi annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed us dollar interest receipts 
with respect to the five year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the five year swaps 
with respect to the ten year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the ten year swaps 
the cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with one of our subsidiaries 
at december   the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were and  respectively 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above 
a portion of an intercompany euro denominated loans payable naturally hedges our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
from time to time we also enter into designated forward euro contracts to adjust the amount of the net investment hedge 
at december   we had no designated forward contracts 
commodity price risk we use natural gas swaps to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our north american manufacturing facilities 
the maturities of these swaps correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
these swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value  which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales through october as the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
for a detailed discussion on natural gas swaps  see critical accounting policies commodity price risk section below 
at december   we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of net of taxes 
assuming that year end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term variable rate borrowings and long term debt  including the current portion  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease increase by approximately outlook in our january  press release  which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on form k  we set forth our assumptions and management s best estimate of the full year earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release 
we forecasted diluted earnings per share in the range of  before any potential special items for the year 
we also forecasted capital expenditures to be in a range of to there can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected 
actual results may differ materially 
see comments on forward looking statements 
significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
with the adoption of sfas r  the compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant  and not based on the price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period as formerly was required under apb no 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash cash settled sars is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of vesting  also a change from apb no 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares stock settled sars and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
sfas r also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives of the instruments  historical and implied volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options and stock settled sars will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder 
these assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study 
the study estimated our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency severity approach 
with this approach  the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis 
future claim frequency has been estimated using our claims history and the stallard manton epidemiological decay model  a widely used industry study 
the decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next to years 
our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience 
the estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation 
although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts  they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors 
a sustained change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
a sustained change in the average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the us  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
we discounted our us future pension liabilities using a rate of at december  the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
a increase to the discount rate for our us pension plans will decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us pension plans will increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by a increase to the discount rate for our post retirement medical plan will increase our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us post retirement medical plan will decrease our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by the expected rate of return on our plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
a change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our us pension plans will increase or decrease our expected annual expense by the pension plan s investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
impairment of goodwill we have defined our segments as our sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets reporting units 
our four business segments are cytec performance chemicals  cytec surface specialties  cytec engineered materials and building block chemicals 
cytec performance chemicals serves large  global industrial markets 
cytec surface specialties serves the large  global coatings market 
cytec engineered materials serves principally aerospace markets 
building block chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets and the customer perspective 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
we initially use a market multiple approach a to estimate a range of fair values by reporting unit  and then use a discounted cash flow approach b if the market multiple approach indicates that a potential impairment might exist to refine and reaffirm the results of the first test 
the market multiple approach provides a straightforward  cost effective and relatively simple method to readily determine if an impairment might exist by utilizing ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization information by reporting unit multiplied by average current industry valuation factors or multiples to easily determine an estimated range of fair value 
due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units  we utilize a three year ebitda average of historical and forecasted ebitda for the reportable segment times the range of ebitda multiple factors 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
the market multiple range utilizes an average lower and upper multiple limit based on recent industry acquisition average ebitda multiples paid by financial and strategic purchasers 
we obtain this information from a third party investment bank 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value using the low end of the range is close to or below the reporting unit s carrying value  in our judgment  we refine the calculation using cash flows to calculate a point estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  as opposed to a range 
if the discounted cash flow approach yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test  as defined by sfas no 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
in  our surface specialties reporting unit had a fair value that did not materially exceed its carrying value  hence  we have estimated its discounted cash flows to complete the first step in the sfas no 
test 
as the majority of this segment s operations and related carrying value including its intangibles and goodwill came from our significant acquisition  we did not expect that its fair value would materially exceed its carrying value for some time until we successfully expand the business 
for the market multiple approach  we used an ebitda range of between x and x 
at the upper limit multiple of x ebitda  the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value but it was below using the x multiple 
the surface specialties ebitda of was a three year average of the actual  the full year estimate  and the budgeted ebitda amounts 
the market multiple approach step a resulted in a fair value range of  to  since the low end of the range of the estimated fair value using the multiples was below the carrying value  we reaffirmed the estimate of the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach in accordance with our aforementioned policy which resulted in a value of  the discounted cash flow approach fair value exceeded the carrying value by  or  indicating that there was no impairment of surface specialties goodwill 
the discounted cash flow approach used our weighted average cost of capital wacc rate of as the discount rate and an estimated net cash flow for a ten year period from to our wacc calculation is the standard calculation and includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
a terminal value of six times ebitda was assumed 
the terminal value ebitda multiple approximates a long term growth rate of which we believe is reasonable for this business 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
the discounted cash flows were based on a ten year projection  covering through the to projections were based on forecasts prepared by surface specialties management 
the to amounts were based on forecasted average revenue growth factor of 
operating profit margins improve from approximately in to approximately by the average revenue growth for the ten year period is 
the projections included average annual capital expenditures of and net working capital increases corresponding to the revenue growth assumed 
we assumed an average tax rate of for the discounted cash flow approach which we believe is a realistic approximation of our future annual effective tax rate 
the following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the estimated fair value of our cytec surface specialties segment 
the approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant 
approximate impact on critical factors change fair value weighted average cost of capital terminal value multiple x annual capital expenditures annual sales volume growth rate operating profit margin because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
prior to the issuance of fin  all uncertain income tax positions were accounted for under fasb statement accounting for contingencies sfas 
we adopted fin in january  which provides that recognition of a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances all within accordance of the provisions of fin including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable for current items and other noncurrent liabilities for long term items 
acquisitions we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations 
derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities we use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  interest rates and natural gas prices in north america 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
foreign currency risk we use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
we hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction 
all derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred  depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
ineffectiveness  if any  in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings 
if the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value  we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income expense  net 
we did not terminate any designated hedging relationships in  or there was no ineffectiveness in  or the earnings impact of currency forward contracts that are used to economically hedge foreign currency assets or liabilities is recognized in other income expense  net during the term of the contracts 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge certain future cash flows from euro receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany loans receivable we have with certain subsidiaries against changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates 
the swaps fix the us dollar equivalent cash flows of these euro denominated intercompany loans and eliminate foreign exchange variability since the notional amounts of the swaps equal that of the loans  and all cash flow dates and interest rates coincide between the swaps and the loans  therefore no ineffectiveness is expected 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the cross currency swaps are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
each period we record the change in the swaps fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income 
we reclassify an amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement to offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the remeasurement to us dollar of the euro loans 
we also accrue for the periodic net swap payments each period in the consolidated income statement 
we monitor the counterparty credit risk and the continued probability of the hedged cash flows as to amount and timing 
another portion of our intercompany euro denominated loans payable of one of our us subsidiaries is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
the portion of the remeasurement of the intercompany loan to the us dollar that relates to the amount designated as a hedge of our net investment is recorded as a translation adjustment 
commodity price risk we use natural gas swaps to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our north american manufacturing facilities 
these swaps  which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases  have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with the effective portion of the hedged item included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on an after tax basis 
gains and losses are reclassified into earnings  as a component of manufacturing cost of sales  in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
if the derivative is no longer highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows  subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense  net 
any ineffectiveness is recognized in other income expense  net in the current period 
if the hedging relationship is terminated we continue to defer the related gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item 
if the forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur we recognize the related gain or loss in other income expense  net in that period 
we did not terminate any hedges during  and all hedged transactions that were forecasted to occur in  and occured as forecasted 
ineffectiveness during these years was insignificant 
the fair values of all of these instruments are based on quotes from third party financial institutions
