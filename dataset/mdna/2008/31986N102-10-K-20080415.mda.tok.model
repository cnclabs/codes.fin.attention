the company was organized under the laws of the state of new jersey in february for the purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding stock of st constitution bank the bank and thereby enabling the bank to operate within a bank holding company structure 
the company became an active bank holding company on july  the bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company

the main office of the company and the bank is located at route north  cranbury  new jersey  and the telephone number is st constitution bank the bank  a commercial bank formed under the laws of the state of new jersey  engages in the business of commercial and retail banking 
as a community bank  the bank offers a wide range of services including demand  savings and time deposits and commercial and consumer installment loans to individuals  small businesses and not for profit organizations principally in middlesex  mercer and somerset counties  new jersey 
the bank conducts its operations through its main office located in cranbury  new jersey  and operates ten additional branch offices in downtown cranbury  hamilton square  hightstown  jamesburg  montgomery  perth amboy  plainsboro  west windsor  fort lee and princeton  new jersey 
the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable legal limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
management efforts focus on positioning the bank to meet the financial needs of the communities in middlesex  mercer and somerset counties and the fort lee area of bergen county and to provide financial services to individuals  families  institutions and small businesses 
to achieve this goal  the bank is focusing its efforts on personal service  expansion of its branch network  innovative product offerings  and technological advances and e commerce 
personal service the bank provides a wide range of commercial and consumer banking services to individuals  families  institutions and small businesses in central new jersey and the fort lee area of bergen county 
the bank s focus is to understand the needs of the community and the customers and tailor products  services and advice to meet those needs 
the bank seeks to provide a high level of personalized banking services  emphasizing quick and flexible responses to customer demands 
expansion of branch banking the bank continually evaluates opportunities for branch bank expansion  either mini branches or full service banks  to continue to grow and meet the needs of the community 
during the first quarter of  the bank completed its acquisition of the hightstown  new jersey branch of another financial institution 
during the third quarter of  the bank relocated its plainsboro branch office from schalks crossing road to schalks crossing road and opened a new branch office at main street  fort lee  bergen county  new jersey 
innovative product offerings in the fourth quarter of  the bank launched its new ez deposit service 
this new product allows customers of the bank to scan checks  using a scanning device furnished by the bank  at the customer s place of business and transmit them directly to the bank for deposit into the customer s account 
the check act allows for the creation of image replacement documents ird that are the legal equivalent of the original check

business customers have access to cash management information and transaction capability through the bank s online business express product offering 
this overall expansion in electronic banking offers the bank s customers another means to access the bank s services easily and at their own convenience 
competition the bank experiences substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in making loans 
in attracting deposits and borrowers  the bank competes with commercial banks  savings banks  and savings and loan associations  as well as regional and national insurance companies and non bank financial institutions  regulated small loan companies and local credit unions  regional and national issuers of money market funds and corporate and government borrowers 
within the direct market area of the bank  there are a significant number of offices of competing financial institutions 
in new jersey generally  and in the bank s local market specifically  large commercial banks  as well as savings banks and savings and loan associations  including provident savings bank and hudson city savings bank  hold a dominant market share and there has been significant merger activity in the last few years  creating even larger competitors 
locally  the bank s most direct competitors include bank of america  pnc bank  wachovia bank  and sovereign bank 
the bank is at a competitive disadvantage compared with these larger national and regional commercial and savings banks 
by virtue of their larger capital  asset size or reserves  many of such institutions have substantially greater lending limits ceilings on the amount of credit a bank may provide to a single customer that are linked to the institution s capital and other resources than the bank 
many such institutions are empowered to offer a wider range of services  including trust services  than the bank and  in some cases  have lower funding costs the price a bank must pay for deposits and other borrowed monies used to make loans to customers than the bank 
in addition to having established deposit bases and loan portfolios  these institutions  particularly large national and regional commercial and savings banks  have the financial ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable 
in addition  non bank financial institutions offer services that compete for deposits with the bank 
for example  brokerage firms and insurance companies offer such instruments as short term money market funds  corporate and government securities funds  mutual funds and annuities 
it is expected that competition in these areas will continue to increase 
some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and supervision as the company and the bank and therefore may be able to offer customers more attractive products than the bank 
however  management of the bank believes that loans to small and mid sized businesses and professionals  which represent the main commercial loan business of the bank  are not always of primary importance to the larger banking institutions 
the bank competes for this segment of the market by providing responsive personalized services  local decision making  and knowledge of its customers and their businesses 
lending activities the bank s lending activities include both commercial and consumer loans 
loan originations are derived from a number of sources including real estate broker referrals  mortgage loan companies  direct solicitation by the bank s loan officers  existing depositors and borrowers  builders  attorneys  walk in customers and  in some instances  other lenders 
the bank has established disciplined and systematic procedures for approving and monitoring loans that vary depending on the size and nature of the loan 
commercial lending the bank offers a variety of commercial loan services including term loans  lines of credit  and loans secured by equipment and receivables 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both secured and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisition and development of real estate and improvements  and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
the bank also makes construction loans to real estate developers for the acquisition  development and construction of residential subdivisions 
commercial loans are granted based on the borrower s ability to generate cash flow to support its debt obligations and other cash related expenses 
a borrower s ability to repay commercial loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and on the quality of its management 
as a general practice  the bank takes as collateral a security interest in any available real estate  equipment  inventory  receivables or other personal property of its borrowers  although occasionally the bank makes commercial loans on an unsecured basis 
generally  the bank requires personal guaranties of its commercial loans to offset the risks associated with such loans 
residential consumer lending a portion of the bank s lending activities consists of the origination of fixed and adjustable rate residential first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied property located in the bank s primary market areas 
home mortgage lending is unique in that a broad geographic territory may be serviced by originators working from strategically placed offices either within the bank s traditional banking facilities or from affordable storefront locations in commercial buildings 
the bank also offers construction loans  second mortgage home improvement loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank finances the construction of individual  owner occupied houses on the basis of written underwriting and construction loan management guidelines 
first mortgage construction loans are made to contractors secured by real estate that is both a pre sold and a speculation basis 
such loans are also made to qualified individual borrowers and are generally supported by a take out commitment from a permanent lender 
the bank makes residential construction loans to individuals who intend to erect owner occupied housing on a purchased parcel of real estate 
the construction phase of these loans has certain risks  including the viability of the contractor  the contractor s ability to complete the project and changes in interest rates 
in most cases  the bank will sell its mortgage loans with terms of years or more in the secondary market 
the sale to the secondary market allows the bank to hedge against the interest rate risks related to such lending operations 
this brokerage arrangement allows the bank to accommodate its clients demands while eliminating the interest rate risk for the to year period generally associated with such loans 
the bank in most cases requires borrowers to obtain and maintain title  fire  and extended casualty insurance  and  where required by applicable regulations  flood insurance 
the bank maintains its own errors and omissions insurance policy to protect against loss in the event of failure of a mortgagor to pay premiums on fire and other hazard insurance policies 
mortgage loans originated by the bank customarily include a due on sale clause  which gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in certain circumstances  including  without limitation  upon the sale or other disposition by the borrower of the real property subject to a mortgage 
in general  the bank enforces due on sale clauses 
borrowers are typically permitted to refinance or repay loans at their option without penalty 
non residential consumer lending non residential consumer loans made by the bank include loans for automobiles  recreation vehicles  and boats  as well as personal loans secured and unsecured and deposit account secured loans 
the bank also conducts various indirect lending activities through established retail companies in its market areas 
non residential consumer loans are attractive to the bank because they typically have a shorter term and carry higher interest rates than are charged on other types of loans 
non residential consumer loans  however  do pose additional risk of collectibility when compared to traditional types of loans  such as residential mortgage loans granted by commercial banks 
consumer loans are granted based on employment and financial information solicited from prospective borrowers as well as credit records collected from various reporting agencies 
stability of the borrower  willingness to pay and credit history are the primary factors to be considered 
the availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such a loan 
the bank seeks collateral that can be assigned and has good marketability with a clearly adequate margin of value 
the geographic area of the borrower is another consideration  with preference given to borrowers in the bank s primary market areas 
supervision and regulation banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy 
in furtherance of those goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted a myriad of legislation that governs banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection of the company s shareholders 
descriptions of  and references to  the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries thereof  and do not purport to be complete 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
state and federal regulations the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
as a bank holding company  the company is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and is required to file with the federal reserve board an annual report and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bhca 
the federal reserve board may also make examinations of the company and its subsidiaries 
the company is subject to capital standards similar to  but separate from  those applicable to the bank 
under the bhca  bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies generally may not acquire the ownership or control of more than of the voting shares  or substantially all the assets  of any company  including a bank or another bank holding company  without the federal reserve board s prior approval 
the company has not applied to become a financial holding company but did obtain such approval to acquire the shares of the bank 
a bank holding company that does not qualify as a financial holding company is generally limited in the types of activities in which it may engage to those that the federal reserve board had recognized as permissible for bank holding companies prior to the date of enactment of the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of for example  a holding company and its banking subsidiary are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services 
at present  the company does not engage in any significant activity other than owning the bank 
in addition to federal bank holding company regulation  the company is registered as a bank holding company with the new jersey department of banking and insurance the department 
the company is required to file with the department copies of the reports it files with the federal banking and securities regulators 
capital adequacy the company is required to comply with minimum capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board 
there are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies and the depository institutions that they own a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for a bank holding company to be considered in compliance 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia required each federal banking agency to revise its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
in addition  pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations  specifying the levels at which a bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution 
the regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia provide that a bank will be classified as well capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  and iv meets certain other requirements 
a bank will be classified as adequately capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of a at least percent  or b at least percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  and iv does not meet the definition of well capitalized 
a bank will be classified as undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of a less than percent  or b less than percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
a bank will be classified as significantly undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of less than percent 
an institution will be classified as critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than percent 
an insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination 
as of december   the bank s capital ratios exceed the requirements to be considered a well capitalized institution under these regulations 
the risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies such as the company currently require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total capital is required to be tier capital  consisting principally of common shareholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
the remainder of the total capital tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance 
at december   the company maintained a tier capital ratio of and total qualifying capital ratio of 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio tier capital to total assets guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
the company s leverage ratio at december  was 
on april   st constitution capital trust i trust i  a statutory business trust and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued million of variable rate trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities in a pooled institutional placement transaction maturing april  trust i utilized the million proceeds along with  invested in trust i by the company to purchase  of floating rate subordinated debentures issued by the company and due to mature on april  the subordinated debentures 
the subordinated debentures constituted the sole assets of trust i  had terms that mirrored the trust preferred securities and were redeemable in whole or part prior to maturity after april  trust i was obligated to distribute all proceeds of a redemption of these subordinated debentures  whether voluntary or upon maturity  to holders of the trust preferred securities 
the company s obligation with respect to the trust preferred securities and the subordinated debentures  when taken together  provided a full and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by the company of the obligations of trust i to pay amounts when due on the trust preferred securities 
on february   the company notified wilmington trust company  as indenture trustee  of the company s intention to redeem the subordinated debentures on april   and the company redeemed the subordinated debentures on that date  as discussed below 
on may   st constitution bancorp established st constitution capital trust ii  a delaware business trust subsidiary trust ii  for the sole purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities the capital securities 
the capital securities were issued in connection with a pooled offering involving approximately other financial institution holding companies 
all of the capital securities were sold to a single pooling vehicle 
the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities were loaned to the company under year floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued to trust ii by the company 
the debentures are the only asset of trust ii 
interest payments on the debentures flow through trust ii to the pooling vehicle 
payments of distributions by trust ii to the pooling vehicle are guaranteed by the company 
effective april   the company redeemed all of the subordinated debentures 
the redemption price was of the aggregate  principal amount of the subordinated debentures  plus approximately  of accrued interest thereon through the redemption date 
as a result of the redemption of the subordinated debentures  a like amount of capital securities issued by trust i was redeemed under the same terms and conditions 
this redemption does not impact the capital securities issued by trust ii on may  restrictions on dividends the primary source of cash to pay dividends  if any  to the company s shareholders and to meet the company s obligations is dividends paid to the company by the bank 
dividend payments by the bank to the company are subject to the new jersey banking act of the banking act and the federal deposit insurance act the fdia 
under the banking act and the fdia  the bank may not pay any dividends if after paying the dividend  it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements 
in addition to these explicit limitations  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
depending upon the circumstances  the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary 
a bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent 
the company has never paid a cash dividend and the company s board of directors has no plans to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future 
the bank paid a stock dividend every year from to  when it was acquired by the company 
the company has paid a stock dividend every year since its formation in from through  the company paid a stock dividend each year 
on december   the company declared a stock dividend  which was paid on january  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january  on december   the company declared another stock dividend  which was paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january  the company also declared a two for one stock split on january   which was paid on february  to shareholders of record on february  all share and per share data has been retroactively adjusted for stock dividends 
priority on liquidation the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the rights of the company as the sole shareholder of the bank  and therefore the rights of the company s creditors and shareholders  to participate in the distributions and earnings of the bank when the bank is not in bankruptcy  are subject to various state and federal law restrictions as discussed above under the heading restrictions of dividends 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as the bank  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of an obligation of the institution to its shareholders the company or any shareholder or creditor of the company 
the claims on the bank by creditors include obligations in respect of federal funds purchased and certain other borrowings  as well as deposit liabilities 
financial institution legislation the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the modernization act became effective in early the modernization act allows bank holding companies meeting management  capital and community reinvestment act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities than is permissible for a bank holding company  including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies  if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  it files a certification  effective in days  and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals  allows banks to establish subsidiaries to engage in certain activities which a financial holding company could engage in  if the bank meets certain management  capital and community reinvestment act standards  allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks and removes various restrictions that currently apply to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies  and establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to financial holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations 
the modernization act modified other financial laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the modernization act also amends the bhca and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking and financial services industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the company cannot be determined at this time 
the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley act  which became law on july   added new legal requirements affecting corporate governance  accounting and corporate reporting for companies with publicly traded securities 
the sarbanes oxley act provides for  among other things a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers except for loans made by a bank subject to regulation o  independence requirements for audit committee members  disclosure of whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert as such term is defined by the sec and if not  why not  independence requirements for outside auditors  a prohibition by a company s registered public accounting firm from performing statutorily mandated audit services for the company if the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer  comptroller  chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the one year period preceding the audit initiation date  certification of financial statements and annual and quarterly reports by the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  two business day filing requirements for insiders filing forms  disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  real time filing of periodic reports  posting of certain sec filings and other information on the company website  the reporting of securities violations up the ladder by both in house and outside attorneys  restrictions on the use of non gaap financial measures  the formation of a public accounting oversight board  and various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
additionally  section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  include in its annual report i a management s report on internal control over financial reporting assessing the company s internal controls  and ii an auditor s attestation report  completed by the registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an accountant s report which is included in the company s annual report  attesting to the effectiveness of management s internal control assessment 
because we are neither a large accelerated filer nor an accelerated filer  under current rules we are not required to provide management s report on internal control over financial reporting until we file our annual report for  and compliance with the auditor s attestation report requirement is not required until we file our annual report for each of the national stock exchanges  including the nasdaq global market where the company s common stock is listed  have implemented new corporate governance rules  including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards  and the adoption of charters for the nominating  corporate governance  and audit committees 
the rule changes are intended to  among other things  make the board of directors independent of management and allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors 
these increased burdens have increased the company s legal and accounting fees and the amount of time that the board of directors and management must devote to corporate governance issues 
effective august   as directed by section a of sarbanes oxley  the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer are each required to certify that the company s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact 
the rules have several requirements  including having these officers certify that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the company s internal controls  they have made certain disclosures to the company s auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about the company s internal controls  and they have included information in the company s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in the company s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation 
as part of the usa patriot act  signed into law on october   congress adopted the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the act 
the act authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks  bank holding companies  broker dealers and insurance companies 
among its other provisions  the act requires each financial institution i to establish an anti money laundering program  ii to establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in united states private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non united states persons or their representatives  and iii to avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  the act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
the department of treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements 
these regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourages cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibits the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and requires all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program 
the bank  a new jersey chartered commercial bank  is subject to supervision and examination by the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
the bank is also subject to regulation by the fdic  which is its principal federal bank regulator 
the bank must comply with various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law  including the maintenance of reserves against deposits  restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon  limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the services that may be offered  and restrictions on dividends as described in the preceding section 
consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank 
in addition to the impact of regulation  commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve board which influence the money supply and credit availability in the national economy 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by fdic regulations  a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra requires the fdic to assess an institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the applicable institution 
the cra requires public disclosure of an institution s cra rating and requires that the fdic provide a written evaluation of an institution s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system 
an institution s cra rating is considered in determining whether to grant charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
performance less than satisfactory may be the basis for denying an application 
at its last cra examination  the bank was rated satisfactory under cra 
firrea under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
these provisions have commonly been referred to as firrea s cross guarantee provisions 
further  under firrea  the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities 
firrea also imposes certain independent appraisal requirements upon a bank s real estate lending activities and further imposes certain loan to value restrictions on a bank s real estate lending activities 
the bank regulators have promulgated regulations in these areas 
insurance of deposits the bank s deposits are insured up to a maximum of  per depositor under the deposit insurance fund 
the fdicia is applicable to depository institutions and deposit insurance 
the fdicia requires the fdic to establish a risk based assessment system for all insured depository institutions 
under this legislation  the fdic is required to establish an insurance premium assessment system based upon i the probability that the insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution  ii the likely amount of the loss  and iii the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
in compliance with this mandate  the fdic has developed a matrix that sets the assessment premium for a particular institution in accordance with its capital level and overall rating by the primary regulator 
under the matrix as currently in effect  the assessment rate ranges from to basis points of assessed deposits 
the bank is also subject to a quarterly fico assessment 
employees the company has two paid employees 
banking operations are conducted by the bank  and as of december   the bank had full time employees and part time employees 
neither the bank s nor the company s employees are represented by any collective bargaining group 
the bank and the company each considers its relations with such employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors 
the common stock of the company is speculative in nature and involves a significant degree of risk 
the risk factors below are not listed in order of importance 
the company faces significant competition 
the company faces significant competition from many other banks  savings institutions and other financial institutions which have branch offices or otherwise operate in the company s market area 
non bank financial institutions  such as securities brokerage firms  insurance companies and money market funds  engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business  which has also led to greater competition 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the company  including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the company is able to accommodate and the ability to aggressively advertise their products 
there can be no assurance that the company and the bank will be able to successfully compete with these entities in the future 
see business competition 
the company s business is affected by economic conditions and related uncertainties 
commercial banking is affected  directly and indirectly  by local  domestic  and international economic and political conditions  and by government monetary and fiscal policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  volatile interest rates  tight money supply  scarce natural resources  real estate values  international conflicts and other factors beyond the control of the company may adversely affect the potential profitability of the company 
a downtrend in several areas  such as real estate  construction and consumer spending  could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to maintain or increase profitability 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with speculative construction lending 
the risks associated with speculative construction lending include the borrower s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget  the sale of the project within projected absorption periods  the economic risks associated with real estate collateral  and the potential of a rising interest rate environment 
such loans may include financing the development and or construction of residential subdivisions 
this activity may involve financing land purchase  infrastructure development ie roads  utilities  etc  as well as construction of residences or multi family dwellings for subsequent sale by developer builder 
because the sale of developed properties is integral to the success of developer business  loan repayment may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market values 
management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending 
further  management concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the bank s lending areas 
federal and state government regulation impact the company s operations 
the operations of the company and the bank are heavily regulated and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities 
in particular  the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board to implement its objectives is changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings 
it is not possible to predict what changes  if any  will be made to the monetary policies of the federal reserve board or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on the future business and earnings prospects of the company 
the company and the bank are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
compliance with the rules and regulations of these agencies may be costly and may limit growth and restrict certain activities  including payment of dividends  investments  loans and interest rate charges  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
the bank is also subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation 
see business supervision and regulation 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time  and we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business and profitability 
because government regulation greatly effects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies  the cost of compliance could adversely affect the company s ability to operate profitably 
if economic conditions deteriorate  particularly in the bank s market area  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as borrowers ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing our loans decreases 
our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  particularly in the bank s market area  including decreases in real estate values  changes in interest rates which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events 
decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans 
adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant investments in mortgage backed securities and securities of this kind may be subject to deterioration in value in certain market conditions 
the company owned as of december   in collateralized mortgages and mortgage backed securities 
several financial institutions have reported significant write downs of the value of mortgage related securities 
certain of these types of securities may also not be marketable except at significant discounts 
while management of the company is as of the date of this report unaware of any material exposures in its portfolio of these securities  market conditions could further deteriorate and result in the recognition of losses in the value of these securities 
we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   and we cannot assure that we have developed an effective remediation plan 
we have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and have developed a plan to remediate such deficiencies 
we cannot assure you that such plan will adequately address these deficiencies or that we have discovered all of the deficiencies that may exist in our internal control over financial reporting

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
throughout the following sections  the company refers to st constitution bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries  st constitution bank  st constitution capital trust i  and st constitution capital trust ii  the bank refers to st constitution bank  and the trusts refers to st constitution capital trust i and st constitution capital trust ii  collectively 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
restatement of previously issued financial results the company is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of december   and the related consolidated statement of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows for the year ended december   including the applicable notes  as well as its unaudited consolidated financial information for each of the first three quarters of and the four quarters of for more information about the restatement  please see the explanatory note to this report and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements for the year ended and as at december  and note  unaudited quarterly financial statements and restatement of interim financial statements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations incorporate the restated amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available to it  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
results of operations the company reported net income for the months ended december  of  an increase of from the  reported for the months ended december  diluted net income per share was for the year ended december  compared to reported for the year ended december  basic net income per share for the year ended december  was as compared to the reported for the year ended december  all share information has been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on february  to shareholders of record on january  key performance ratios remained strong for the fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  the company s earnings for the fiscal year reflect continuing momentum across a broad range of product and service offerings 
increased lending activity  coupled with increases in deposits through branch network expansion and secondary market loan sales volume  as well as a reduction in the provision for loan losses in versus  fueled both the record earnings and balance sheet growth 
management believes that the company has positioned itself for continued success with the combination of a strong capital base  a commitment to provide exceptional customer service  and a commitment to maintain the technology necessary to provide its customers with easy access to the financial products and services offered by the bank 
net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december  and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
tax equivalent basis 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  related yields  and associated funding costs 
the rate volume table demonstrates the impact on net interest income of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
the company s net interest income increased on a tax equivalent basis by  or  to  for the year ended december   from the  reported for the year ended december  as indicated in the rate volume table  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in the interest income of  resulting from increased balances in the loan portfolio components 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increases in the rates paid on deposit components

the bank also generates non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include safe deposit rentals  wire transfer service fees and automated teller machine fees for non customers

the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income  while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources

loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the bank s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans wholesale and retail  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
total loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to an average of  for the year ended december  growth in the average loan portfolio balance was generated primarily by an increase of  or  in commercial and commercial real estate loans 
at december   total loans amounted to  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the average yield earned on the loan portfolio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of basis points 
this increase is primarily due to the rising interest rate environment that evolved during the last half of and continued throughout the first half of the following table represents the components of the loan portfolio for the dates indicated 
december  amount amount amount amount amount construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans loans to individuals lease financing deferred loan fees all other loans total commercial and commercial real estate loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  commercial loans consist primarily of loans to small and middle market businesses and are typically working capital loans used to finance inventory  receivables or equipment needs 
these loans are generally secured by business assets of the commercial borrower 
the average yield on the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio increased basis points to for from for construction loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  generally  these loans represent owner occupied or investment properties and usually complement a broader commercial relationship between the bank and the borrower 
construction loans are structured to provide for advances only after work is completed and inspected by qualified professionals 
the average yield on the construction loan portfolio decreased basis points to for from for residential loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  these loans consist primarily of residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate 
the average yield on this portfolio increased basis points to for from for the following table provides information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans and construction loans at december  maturity range type within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial commercial real estate construction total fixed rate loans floating rate loans total non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans decreased by  to  at december  from  at december  this decrease is primarily due to a transfer to other real estate owned of  for real estate acquired in full satisfaction of a loan in foreclosure 
approximately half of the non performing loans is an unfinished residential construction project with the majority of the remaining half being comprised of commercial loans 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans decreased to at december  from at december  for the reason previously stated 
loan quality is considered to be sound  and this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets increased by  to  at december  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at december  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at december  or at december  and december   the bank had no loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest income 
non performing assets and loans non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all or part of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements may include a specific reserve for substandard or high risk loans  plus an allocated reserve  and possibly an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk assets 
high risk loans are assigned an adverse grade since the loans are generally characterized with having weaknesses that may result in deterioration of repayment or worse 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual high risk loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which  in turn  employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
during the quarterly reviews  the company may determine that an unallocated allowance is appropriate 
an unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it may be prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and non performing loans was adequate 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

the provision for loan losses was  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and management considers a complete review of the following specific factors in determining the provision for loan losses historical losses by loan category  non accrual loans  problem loans as identified through internal classifications  collateral values  and the growth and size of the portfolio 
in addition to these factors  management takes into consideration current economic conditions and local real estate market conditions 
the decrease in the provision for the year ended december  was primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound  and the determination of the provision for loan losses amount was primarily due to the manageable balances in non accrual loans and management s assessment of economic conditions in the bank s marketplace 
the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated

these borrowings are primarily used to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation 
the average balance of other borrowed funds decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the average balance of  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the fact that deposit growth exceeded loan portfolio growth

these advances may be called by the fhlb quarterly at the option of the fhlb if rates rise and the rate earned by the fhlb is no longer a market rate 
these advances are fully secured by marketable securities 
shareholders equity and dividends shareholders equity increased by  or  to  at december   from  at december  book value per common share increased by  or  to at december  from at december  the increase in shareholders equity and book value per share resulted primarily from net income of  less the effect of stock buybacks

a stock dividend was declared in and paid in the company s common stock is quoted on the nasdaq global market under the symbol fccy 
the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
for information on regulatory capital  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page f off balance sheet arrangements the following table shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit commitments to sell residential loans liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and a correspondent bank which further supports and enhances liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained an overnight line of credit at the fhlb in the amount of  plus a one month overnight repricing line of credit of  advances issued under these programs are subject to fhlb stock level and collateral requirements 
pricing of these advances may fluctuate based on existing market conditions 
the bank also maintains an unsecured federal funds line of  with a correspondent bank 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
at december   the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  net cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operations of  for the year ended december  the primary source of funds is net income from operations adjusted for provision for loan losses  depreciation expenses  and net amortization of premiums on securities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash usage for compared to resulted from the added inflow of cash and cash equivalents from the february hightstown branch acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the cash provided in resulted primarily from an increase in borrowed funds 
the securities portfolios are also a source of liquidity  providing cash flows from maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
for the year ended december   prepayments and maturities of investment securities totaled  another source of liquidity is the loan portfolio  which provides a flow of payments and maturities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing and the fair value of such instruments at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  in thousands interest sensitivity period total within one year one year to two years non interest sensitive and over two years total day day day day earning assets total investment securities loans other interest earning assets source of funds savings and time deposits other interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing sources asset liability sensitivity gap period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the bank continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective  and therefore has focused its efforts on increasing the bank s spread by attracting lower costing retail deposits 
in addition to utilizing the gap ratio for interest rate risk assessment  management utilizes simulation analysis whereby the model estimates the variance in net income with a change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over and month periods 
given recent simulations  net interest income would be within policy guidelines regardless of the direction of market rates 
three months ended march  compared to three months ended march results of operations summary the company reported net income of  for the three months ended march   an increase of over the  reported for the three months ended march  diluted net income per share was for the three months ended march  compared to reported for the three months ended march  all share information has been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on february  to shareholders of record on january  key performance ratios remained strong for the three months ended march  as compared to the three months ended march  return on average assets and return on average equity were and  respectively  for the three months ended march   compared to and  respectively  for the corresponding prior year period 
a significant factor impacting the company s net interest income has been the rising level of market interest rates that characterized the marketplace in and has continued through the first quarter of the federal reserve bank s open market committee raised short term interest rates four times during  which raised the targeted federal funds rate to the current at march  these increases in short term market rates drive up the cost of the company s core deposits 
as a result  the company experienced a basis point increase in the cost of its interest bearing deposits to at march  compared to at march  the company s net interest margin experienced a decrease of basis points to at march  compared to at march  despite these interest environment challenges  the company increased net interest income by to  for the three months ended march  from the  for the three months ended march  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was the and increases in the securities and loan portfolios  respectively 
this was partially offset by the increase in interest expense resulting from increases in the rates paid on deposit components 
a second significant factor impacting financial results for the first quarter of was the february  settlement of the transaction whereby the bank acquired all of the deposit liabilities and related assets of the hightstown  new jersey branch banking office of another financial institution 
this acquisition added approximately million in cash and new deposits to the balance sheet at march  in addition to the impact on most component of income expense on the statement of income for the three months ended march  earnings analysis net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues for the three month period ended march  and of net revenues for the three month period ended march  net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average rates for the three month periods ended march  and  respectively 
the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

average interest earning assets increased by  or  to  for the quarter ended march  from  for the quarter ended march   with increases of  in average total loans and  in average total securities in the three months ended march  when compared to the three months ended march  the bank s average loan portfolio grew by where growth was focused on construction and commercial loans when compared to the average loan portfolio for the first quarter of the yields on loans averaged for the first quarter of  increasing basis points over the yield on loans for the first quarter of the bank s average securities portfolio increased by and the yield on that portfolio increased by basis points for the quarter ended march  when compared to the quarter ended march  overall  the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points to for the quarter ended march  when compared to for the quarter ended march  average interest bearing liabilities increased by  or  to  for the quarter ended march  from  for the quarter ended march  certificates of deposit increased on average by  for the three months ended march  when compared to the three months ended march  the cost of certificates of deposit increased basis points to for the first quarter of compared to for the first quarter of during june  the company added approximately million in trust preferred securities  which helped fund the growth of the loan and securities portfolios 
overall  the cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for the three months ended march  compared to for the three months ended march the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the first three months of compared to for the first three months of non interest income total non interest income for the three months ended march  was  a decrease of  or  over non interest income of  for the three months ended march  service charges on deposit accounts represents a significant source of non interest income 
service charge revenues decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march  from the  for the three months ended march  this decrease was the result of a lower volume of uncollected and overdraft fees collected on deposit accounts during the first quarter of compared to gain on sales of loans decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march  when compared to  for the three months ended march  the rising rate environment that existed throughout and continued into the first quarter of has significantly impacted the volume of sales transactions in the mortgage loan and sba loan markets and resultant gains resulting from these transactions 
non interest income also includes income from bank owned life insurance boli which amounted to  for the three months ended march  compared to  for the three months ended march  the bank purchased tax free boli assets to partially offset the cost of employee benefit plans and reduced the company s overall effective tax rate 
the bank also generates non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include safe deposit box rental  wire transfer service fees and automated teller machine fees for non bank customers 
increased customer demand for these services contributed to the other income component of non interest income amounting to  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march  non interest expense non interest expenses decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march  from  for the three months ended march  the following table presents the major components of non interest expenses for the three months ended march  and non interest expenses three months ended march  restated salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses equipment expense marketing computer services regulatory  professional and other fees office expense all other expenses salaries and employee benefits  which represent the largest portion of non interest expenses  increased by  or  to  for the three months ended march  compared to  for the three months ended march  the increase in salaries and employee benefits for the three months ended march  was a result of an increase in the number of employees  regular merit increases and increased health care costs 
staffing levels overall increased to full time equivalent employees at march  as compared to full time equivalent employees at march  the february  acquisition of the hightstown branch contributed to this increase by increasing the number of full time equivalent employees by and the resultant salary and benefit expenses by approximately  regulatory  professional and other fees decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march  compared to  for the three months ended march  during  the company chose to incur additional accounting  legal and consulting fees primarily as a result of the new internal control compliance requirements contained in section of the sarbanes oxley act in anticipation of the company s compliance in an important financial services industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income plus non interest income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income  while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
the bank s efficiency ratio decreased to for the three months ended march   compared to for the three months ended march  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  for the three months ended march  and  for the three months ended march  management considers a complete review of the following specific factors in determining the provision for loan losses historical losses by loan category  non accrual loans  problem loans as identified through internal classifications  collateral values  and the growth and size of the portfolio 
in addition to these factors  management takes into consideration current economic conditions and local real estate market conditions

investment securities the bank s investment securities represented of total assets at march  and at december  total investment securities increased  or  at march  to  from  at december  securities available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes 
securities available for sale consist primarily of us government and federal agency securities as well as mortgage backed securities 
activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically more attractive returns 
at march   available for sale securities amounted to  and increase of  or  from december  at march   the securities available for sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of  compared to net unrealized losses of  at december  these unrealized losses are reflected net of tax in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
securities held to maturity  which are carried at amortized historical cost  are investments for which there is the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of obligations of states and political subdivisions 
at march   securities held to maturity were  an increase of  or from  at december  the fair value of the held to maturity portfolio at march   was  resulting in a net unrealized loss of  during the three months ended march   the bank purchased securities in the amounts of  and  for the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios  respectively 
these purchases were funded primarily by the cash received in the hightstown branch completed in february loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the company s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
the following table sets forth the classification of loans by major category at march  and december  loan portfolio composition march  december  component amount of total amount of total construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans to individuals deferred loan fees all other loans the loan portfolio increased  or  at march  to  from  at december  the ability of the company to enter into larger loan relationships and management s philosophy of relationship banking are key factors in the company s strategy for loan growth 
the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and the recovery of the carrying amount of real estate are subject to changes in the company s market region s economic environment and real estate market 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans decreased by  to  at march  from  at december  the largest segment of non accrual loans represents unfinished residential construction where litigation has commenced and workout negotiations are in process 
the balance of the non performing loans are centered in commercial loans for which litigation has commenced 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans decreased to at march  from at december  for the reasons previously stated  but loan quality is still considered to be sound 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets decreased by  to  at march  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at march  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at march   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at march  or december  at march  and december   the bank had no loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest 
non performing assets and loans march  december  non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient in the opinion of management to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans  including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management of the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at march   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans was adequate 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at march   an increase of  from december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at march  and at december   respectively 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate in relation to credit risk exposure levels

at march   the ratios of the company exceeded the ratios required to be considered well capitalized 
it is management s goal to monitor and maintain adequate capital levels to continue to support asset growth and continue its status as a well capitalized institution 
liquidity at march   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational and customer credit needs could be satisfied 
liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale

at june   available for sale securities amounted to  and increase of  or  from december  at june   the securities available for sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of  compared to net unrealized losses of  at december  these unrealized losses are reflected net of tax in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
securities held to maturity  which are carried at amortized historical cost  are investments for which there is the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of obligations of states and political subdivisions

these purchases were funded primarily by the cash received in the hightstown branch acquisition completed in february loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the company s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
the following table sets forth the classification of loans by major category at june  and december  loan portfolio composition june  december  component amount of total amount of total construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans to individuals deferred loan fees all other loans the loan portfolio increased  or  at june  to  from  at december  the ability of the company to enter into larger loan relationships and management s philosophy of relationship banking are key factors in the company s strategy for loan growth 
the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and the recovery of the carrying amount of real estate are subject to changes in the company s market region s economic environment and real estate market 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans decreased by  to  at june  from  at december  the largest segment of non accrual loans represents unfinished residential construction where litigation has commenced and workout negotiations are in process 
the balance of the non performing loans are centered in commercial loans for which litigation has commenced 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans decreased to at june  from at december  for the reasons previously stated  but loan quality is still considered to be sound 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets decreased by  to  at june  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at june  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at june   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at june  or december  at june  and december   the bank had no loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest 
non performing assets and loans june  december  non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient in the opinion of management to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans  including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management of the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at june   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and non performing loans was adequate 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at june   an increase of  from december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at june  and at december   respectively 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate in relation to credit risk exposure levels 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data

liquidity at june   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational and customer credit needs could be satisfied 
liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities

at september   securities held to maturity were  an increase of  or from  at december  the fair value of the held to maturity portfolio at september   was  resulting in a net unrealized loss of during the nine months ended september   the bank purchased securities in the amounts of  and  for the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios  respectively 
these purchases were funded primarily by the cash received in the hightstown branch acquisition completed in february loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the company s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
the following table sets forth the classification of loans by major category at september  and december  loan portfolio composition september  december  component amount of total amount of total construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans to individuals deferred loan fees all other loans the loan portfolio increased  or  at september  to  from  at december  the ability of the company to enter into larger loan relationships and management s philosophy of relationship banking are key factors in the company s strategy for loan growth 
the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and the recovery of the carrying amount of real estate are subject to changes in the company s market region s economic environment and real estate market 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans decreased by  to  at september  from  at december  the largest segment of non accrual loans represents unfinished residential construction where litigation has commenced and workout negotiations are in process 
the balance of the non performing loans are centered in commercial loans for which litigation has commenced 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans decreased to at september  from at december  for the reasons previously stated  but loan quality is still considered to be sound 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets decreased by  to  at september  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at september  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at september   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at september  or december  at september  the bank had one loan for that was days or more past due but still accruing interest 
the bank had no such loans at december  non performing assets and loans september  december  non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient in the opinion of management to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans  including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management of the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at september   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and non performing loans was adequate 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at september   an increase of  from december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at september  and at december   respectively 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate in relation to credit risk exposure levels 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data

total deposits increased  or  to  at september  from  at december  on february   the bank acquired all of the deposit liabilities and related assets of the hightstown  new jersey branch banking office of another financial institution 
this acquisition added approximately million in new deposits 
borrowings borrowings are mainly comprised of fixed rate convertible advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb and federal funds purchased 
these borrowings are primarily used to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation

in  the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of a limited number of the company s shares at management s discretion on the open market 
the company undertook this repurchase program in order to increase shareholder value

actual capital amounts and ratios for the company and the bank as of september  and december  are as follows actual for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio as of september  company total capital to risk weighted assets n a tier capital to risk weighted assets n a tier capital to average assets n a bank total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets as of december  restated company total capital to risk weighted assets n a tier capital to risk weighted assets n a tier capital to average assets n a bank total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets the minimum regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions require institutions to have a tier capital to average assets ratio of  a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of

at september   the ratios of the company exceeded the ratios required to be considered well capitalized 
it is management s goal to monitor and maintain adequate capital levels to continue to support asset growth and continue its status as a well capitalized institution 
liquidity at september   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational and customer credit needs could be satisfied 
liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and a correspondent bank which further supports and enhances liquidity 
at september   the bank maintained an overnight line of credit at the fhlb in the amount of  plus a one month overnight repricing line of credit of  advances issued under these programs are subject to fhlb stock level and collateral requirements 
pricing of these advances may fluctuate based on existing market conditions

at september   the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in the nine months ended september  compared to  in the nine months ended september  the primary sources of funds are net income from operations adjusted for provision for loan losses  depreciation expenses  and net proceeds from sales of loans held for sale 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  in the nine months ended september  compared to  used in investing activities in the nine months ended september  the current period amount was primarily the result of the net increase in the loan portfolio plus investment securities purchases partially offset by the cash and cash equivalents acquired with the hightstown branch 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  in the nine months ended september  compared to  provided by financing activities in the nine months ended september  the current period amount resulted primarily from an increase in borrowings combined with the repayment of redeemable subordinated debentures during the nine months period ended september  the securities portfolio is also a source of liquidity  providing cash flows from maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
during the nine months ended september   maturities and prepayments of investment securities totaled  another source of liquidity is the loan portfolio  which provides a flow of payments and maturities 
the company anticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand  the cash flow from assets as well as other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for the company s future operating  investing and financing needs 
management will continue to monitor the company s liquidity and maintain it at a level that it deems adequate and not excessive 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations revised 
fas r will significantly change how entities apply the acquisition method to business combinations 
the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
this statement is broader than sfas  which only applied to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
sfas r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity the acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses including combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
this replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
sfas required the acquirer to include the costs incurred to effect the acquisition acquisition related costs in the cost of the acquisition that was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
sfas r requires those costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition 
in accordance with sfas  restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur were recognized as if they were a liability assumed at the acquisition date 
sfas r requires the acquirer to recognize those restructuring costs that do not meet the criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities as an expense as incurred 
acquisition related transaction costs will be expensed as incurred 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability on the acquisition date 
under sfas r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
additionally  under sfas r  the allowance for loan losses of an acquiree will not be permitted to be recognized by the acquirer

at each subsequent reporting date  unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments

sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the statement will require the company to apply valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs and are consistent with the market approach  the income approach  and or the cost approach 
the definition and framework apply to both items recognized and reported at fair value in the financial statements and items disclosed at fair value in the notes to the financial statements 
the statement also requires expanded disclosure in interim and annual financial statements about how the company uses fair value 
the disclosures focus on items measured at fair value based on significant unobservable inputs and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the disclosures are only required for items recognized and reported at fair value in the financial statements 
the statement does not change existing accounting rules governing what can or what must be recognized and reported at fair value in the company s financial statements  or disclosed at fair value in the company s notes to the financial statements 
additionally  sfas does not eliminate practicability exceptions that exist in accounting pronouncements amended by this statement when measuring fair value 
as a result  the company will not be required to recognize any new instruments at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  although earlier application was encouraged 
prospective application of the provisions of sfas is required as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for certain circumstances specified in the statement that require retrospective application 
in march  the fasb issued fsp fas to partially delay the effective implementation of sfas until fiscal years beginning after november   for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
assets and liabilities currently reported or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis in the company s financial statements include investment securities  impaired loans  residential mortgage loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights and derivatives
