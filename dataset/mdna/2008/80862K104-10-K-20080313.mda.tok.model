overview sciclone pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat life threatening diseases 
our strategy is to in license products in the areas of cancer and viral infectious diseases  and to develop them for commercialization in the major pharmaceutical markets with a particular focus on china  one of the world s fastest growing pharmaceutical markets 
zadaxin  our brand of thymalfasin  is one of the largest imported drugs  as measured by revenue  in china today  and currently is in late stage clinical development for the treatment of malignant melanoma and hepatitis c virus hcv 
our proprietary in licensed compound scv entered phase clinical development for viral infectious disease in june we also submitted a regulatory application to the chinese state food and drug administration sfda in december related to dc bead  a product for the treatment of liver cancer  or hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  for which we obtained chinese marketing rights in june on april   we announced that we had acquired the exclusive rights in the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp  a clinical stage compound for the treatment of cancer 
under the terms of the agreements with resistys  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of avantogen oncology  inc  and with resprotect gmbh  we paid approximately  in upfront fees  and in the first quarter of a  milestone payment upon dosage of the first patient in a phase clinical trial 
in addition  we may be obligated to pay post phase success based regulatory and commercial payments up to  and royalties on future sales 
we intend to initially develop rp for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in a combination therapy with gemcitabine  the standard of care for pancreatic cancer therapy 
in addition to our current product portfolio  we believe we are well positioned to in license additional therapeutics for both china and the significantly larger us and european markets  in part because of our opportunity to develop and commercialize such products in china 
also  we intend to use our clinical work in china to support and accelerate regulatory applications in the united states and europe 
our european partner  sigma tau  is conducting a triple therapy combination zadaxin plus pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin hepatitis c clinical trial in europe 
in a press release dated february   we reported promising interim blinded results indicating thymalfasin may increase sustained viral response svr rates for hcv non responder patients 
we expect the results of the trial in the third quarter of in june  we reported positive survival data from a phase trial  also conducted by sigma tau  treating patients with stage iv malignant melanoma indicating that thymalfasin in combination with dacarbazine dtic chemotherapy tripled the overall response rate and extended overall survival by nearly months compared to malignant melanoma patients treated with dtic  the current standard of care  and interferon alpha 
in collaboration with sigma tau  in october  we shared the melanoma clinical data with and received approval from  the united states federal food and drug administration fda to initiate phase registration trials 
we and sigma tau are planning the design of a phase melanoma trial and our regulatory strategy including a special protocol assessment spa to be filed with the fda 
thymalfasin phase clinical development and commercialization plans for hcv and melanoma have potentially significantly different timelines  costs  and sizes of prospective addressable markets  and the markets for these two products differ in terms of competitive products and other factors 
consequently  before proceeding with a further melanoma trial  
table of contents we and sigma tau will review the final results for the current hcv clinical trial anticipated in the third quarter of in order to determine the next steps for an optimal thymalfasin development program for the hcv and malignant melanoma indications 
we manufacture zadaxin for sale and for our clinical trials  through third party contract manufacturers  and we conduct our research and development efforts principally through arrangements with clinical research sites  contract research organizations and universities 
as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately  at least over the next few years  we expect net losses due to increased operating expenses as we expand our research and development and clinical testing efforts and our sales and marketing capabilities 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is dependent on expansion of sales of zadaxin and securing regulatory approval for dc bead in china  the execution and successful completion of zadaxin  scv  and rp clinical trials and securing regulatory approvals for these products in the major pharmaceutical markets of the united states  europe and japan 
if regulatory approval is secured in those territories  our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability will depend on the successful commercialization and marketing of these products 
clinical development involves numerous risks and uncertainties and  in addition to our successes  we have experienced setbacks in clinical development in the past 
in particular  in december and june  we reported results from our two us phase trials evaluating the double therapy combination of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha to treat hcv patients who had failed previous therapy 
the results from these trials did not demonstrate that zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha provides a statistically significant clinical benefit when compared with pegylated interferon alpha alone 
in addition  other factors may also impact our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability  including the pricing of zadaxin and its manufacturing and marketing costs  our ability to compete in pharmaceutical markets  the cost of product development and commercialization programs including scv  dc bead  and rp  the timing and costs of acquiring rights to additional drugs  our ability to fund our operations and the entrance into and extension of agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
we expect net sales to increase in due to increased sales to china 
primarily due to the level of research and development activities and other operations  we expect a net loss and a reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for we believe we will need to raise additional capital in to fund our operations  including anticipated clinical trials  beyond the first quarter of we are exploring various alternatives for financing in addition to sales of equity of sciclone  including a line of credit  debt financing and financing of our chinese operations either through debt  equity or joint venture transactions  but we have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  the number  timing  costs and results of pre clinical and clinical trials of our products  market acceptance of zadaxin  and potentially of scv  dc bead  and rp  and the timing of orders for zadaxin from international markets  particularly china  the regulatory approval process  the timing of fda or international regulatory approvals  and the acquisition of additional product rights and the funding  if any  provided as a result of corporate partnering arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements have 
table of contents been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of delivery 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them 
importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we intend to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
we exercise judgment in estimating return reserves and estimate expected returns primarily on historical patterns 
historically  we have had no product returns of damaged  defective or expired product 
as such  no amount was accrued for product returns as of december  and in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii there are no future performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
we maintain reserves for credit losses  and such losses have been within our expectations 
we recognize reserves for bad debts ranging from to of past due accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our collectibility experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  an analysis of the historical payment patterns of our customers  the circumstances of each individual customer and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would increase our general and administrative expenses 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than expected  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses 

table of contents inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of  related to zadaxin product rights and have not recorded any impairment losses to date related to intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses are principally incurred for our clinical trials including cost sharing of sigma tau s clinical trial in europe using zadaxin as part of a novel triple therapy combination for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv  our phase clinical trials for rp and scv in  our development plans in for a phase clinical trial for malignant melanoma  and our phase clinical trials that took place in the united states  primarily in and research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
expenses related to grants to the institutions for our us hcv and scv clinical trials were accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
in general  for these clinical trials  these expenses are higher for the initial and final months of a patient s scheduled treatment and observation 
expenses relating to clinical research organizations or other entities managing the trials and laboratory and other direct expenses are recognized in the period they are estimated to be incurred and the services performed 
we monitor active patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could underestimate our actual research and development expenses  requiring the recording of additional expenses and an increase in net loss in the future 
stock option valuation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  fas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
accordingly  we did not recognize compensation expense in accounting for our employee stock purchase plan or our stock option plans for options to employees and directors granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

table of contents we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized for the years ended december  and includes compensation cost for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas compensation cost also includes all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the option as determined using the black scholes option valuation model and the single option approach 
the company amortizes the compensation cost over the vesting period  which is generally four years  using the straight line attribution method 
results for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of fas r 
determining the fair value of each option award under fas r using the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
we determined weighted average valuation assumptions as follows volatility we believe the historical volatility of our stock price is indicative of expectations about expected future stock price volatility 
we estimated volatility using the historical share price performance for a time period equivalent to the expected term of the option 
we also considered the implied volatility of market traded puts and calls on our common stock  however  since these puts and calls are thinly traded  the information was not considered representative of their future estimated volatility 
expected term when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the option and our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity rates with similar terms to the expected term of the option 
dividend yield the expected dividend yield is as we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected forfeitures we use historical data regarding forfeitures of our options to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures 
we record stock based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual conditions  events or amounts differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and its non cash effect on our results of operations could be materially impacted 
as of december   unamortized compensation expense related to unvested options was approximately  the weighted average period over which compensation expense related to these options will be recognized is years 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and all were derived from sales of zadaxin 
sales to customers in china accounted for approximately  and of this revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product prices have remained stable throughout this three year period 
for the years ended december   and  sales in each year to three or four importing agents in china accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our product sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and one other importer accounted for of our sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and 
table of contents two others accounted for a combined 
in  guang dong south pharmaceutical foreign trade co  ltd  zhuhai golden medicine co  ltd and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for   and of our sales  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in those periods 
as of december   approximately  or  of our accounts receivable were attributable to two customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 
contract revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we recognized  in contract revenue for a partial license fee for zadaxin from a third party 
there was no similar revenue for the years ended december  or contract revenue recognized in and is in connection with the  payment we received from sigma tau in january and a  payment we received from sigma tau in december this revenue was recognized as contract revenue over the course of the zadaxin hcv us clinical program and the period of sharing the clinical data from this program with sigma tau in accordance with the performance requirements under our contract with sigma tau 
gross margin was   and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in was primarily due to an increase of  in royalty expense recorded in december related to annual minimum royalties due to sales of product from through according to our license agreement with wayne state university wsu 
we expect cost of product sales and hence gross margin to vary from year to year  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of product related fixed costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory 
research and development r d expenses were   and  and represented approximately   and of our total operating costs and expenses for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses from to was primarily due to a  increase in acquisition and legal costs incurred in april related to the acquisition of the exclusive rights in the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp  an increase of approximately  in clinical trial expenses and an increase of  in drug development expenses mainly related to our phase trials for rp and scv  and in preparation of the prospective phase trial for melanoma 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in r d including a decrease of  in stock based compensation expense and a  decrease in compensation and benefits related expenses  net of consulting fees  a decrease of  in preclinical pharmacology expenses  a decrease of  in rent expense due to lower rents at our new corporate office  and a decrease of  in computer software expense 
r d expenses in included stock based compensation expense of  following the adoption of fas r 
the overall decrease in r d expenses from to was primarily related to the us phase hcv clinical trials completed in mid the major components of r d expenses consist of clinical studies performed by clinical trial institutions and contract research organizations  related materials and supplies  preclinical work  pharmaceutical development  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  third party research funding  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of business development  patent costs  preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs primarily relate to clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
during  we recorded approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities 
during  we recorded approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities 
this compares to expenses in of approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities 

table of contents the initiation and continuation of our current clinical development programs has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
although it is not possible to determine the total cost expected to be incurred in any particular year for each clinical trial due to the uncertain nature of the clinical trial process  we estimate that our future costs for relating to research and development will be approximately  including a  milestone payment upon dosage of the first patient in the rp phase clinical trial  other rp  zadaxin  and scv development costs 
the actual costs incurred in future periods will vary depending in particular upon timeline and design for a zadaxin phase melanoma clinical trial and final decisions regarding the timing and expense sharing arrangements for the trial 
if we proceed with all of the current development programs for zadaxin  rp and scv  we would need to seek additional capital in an expansion or significant extension of our clinical development programs may require us to seek additional capital resources 
sales and marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in and was partially due to  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense following the adoption of fas r 
the remaining increases in and were primarily due to increases in sales and marketing personnel  promotional activities and operating expense related to our expanding sales and marketing efforts 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for to be approximately  higher than those incurred in due to increased sales efforts 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to  was primarily related to an increase in compensation and benefits related expenses of  due to an increase in general and administrative personnel  an increase in stock based compensation expense of  mainly related to our chief executive officer s employment agreement  and a  increase in office expense related to the relocation of our corporate office 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily related to an increase in compensation and benefits related expenses of  increased consulting fees of  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  following the adoption of fas r 
for  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease approximately  compared to general and administrative expenses incurred for as a result of a reduction in consulting fees 
interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted from reduced interest earned on cash balances due to lower cash balances  partially offset by higher interest rates in the period 
the increase in interest and investment income in is primarily due to cash balances earning higher interest rates in that period 
for  we expect a decrease of approximately  in interest and investment income as a result of lower cash balances 
interest and investment expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and the interest expense for and primarily related to interest on the company s convertible notes payable 
the company repaid  and  of convertible notes in december and march  respectively  resulting in the decrease in interest expense for those periods 
other income expense  net was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in other income for the period  as compared to both and  was primarily due to a one time payment of  that we received in april for the resolution of our dispute with schering plough kk regarding the conduct of hbv clinical trials in japan with zadaxin 
provision for income tax of  for the year ended december  related to our foreign operations in china 
there was no similar provision for income tax recorded for the years ended december  or 
table of contents net loss income for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in net loss in was mainly due to the income effect of the one time payment of  that we received in april for the resolution of our dispute regarding the conduct of hbv clinical trials in japan  increased clinical trial activities related to our phase clinical trials for rp and scv in  and our development plans for a phase clinical trial for melanoma 
the increase in net income in  as compared to  was primarily due to the one time payment of  as part of a settlement regarding clinical trials in japan 
basic and diluted net loss income per share for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic net loss income per share for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
weighted average shares outstanding used in computing diluted net loss income per share for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
income taxes we have not recorded any federal or state income tax expense for the years ended december   and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly  no deferred us income taxes have been provided thereon 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  using the average receivables method  were  and days in  and  respectively 
the majority of our sales are to customers in the people s republic of china  where our accounts receivable collections have standard credit terms of days 
during   and  such receivables were collected within these terms 
days sales outstanding decreased from to  due to normal fluctuations in the timing of customer payments received 
at december   and  we had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in each of these years  the principal factors affecting these balances were the net loss income and cash used in financing activities 
we currently estimate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be lower than the balance at december  the expected decrease in this balance is primarily attributable to cash used in operations 
the short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid marketable securities 
our restricted short term investment of  as of december   relates to a letter of credit secured by a certificate of deposit to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
due to the recent adverse developments in the credit markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our short term  student loan related  aaa rated  adjustable rate securities 
these developments could result in the reclassification of such securities to long term investments 
as of december   we held 
table of contents  in adjustable rate notes reflected as short term investments 
as of february   we had liquidated  of these notes and held the remaining  in february and march  our remaining  in auction rate securities experienced a failed auction  and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investments and fully recover the carrying value of our investments in the near term may be limited or not exist and we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until stability is restored with respect to these securities 
we believe that  even allowing for the reclassification of these securities to long term and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
net cash used in provided by operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december   was comprised primarily of net loss of  which was adjusted for non cash items such as stock based compensation expense of  and depreciation and amortization of  and  of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included an increase in our clinical trials expense of  and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of  both increases related primarily to our phase rp and scv clinical trials  and to the development plans for a melanoma clinical trial 
these inflows were partially offset by an increase in inventory levels of  as our supplier of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient api product for the manufacture of zadaxin was able to produce higher yields on production runs  enabling us to increase our inventory levels  compared to the lower than expected inventory levels in the prior year period  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  mainly related to our phase rp clinical trial 
net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net income of  which was adjusted for non cash expense related to employee stock options of  due to the adoption of fas r and depreciation and amortization of  and  of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included an increase in accounts receivable of  due to fluctuations in the timing of payments received within credit terms from customers and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of  primarily related to an increase in the royalty accrual 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net loss of  net cash provided by investing activities amounted to  for the year ended december   compared to cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities in of  was primarily due to the sale of us treasury securities and municipal securities holdings to fund operations  partially offset by  in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in of  was primarily due to increased holdings in us treasury securities of  offset partially by a decrease in municipal securities holdings of  and due to purchases of property and equipment of  net cash used in investing activities in of  was primarily due to the purchase of us treasury securities in the amount of  in and purchases of property and equipment of  net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of proceeds received of approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of the repayment of a  convertible note  partially offset by proceeds received of approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations royalty obligations other long term liabilities total these are future minimum rental commitments for office space and copiers leased under non cancelable operating lease arrangements 
these are amounts payable to our european marketing and development partner  sigma tau  to conduct and complete an hcv clinical trial in europe 
this includes minimum royalty payments to the us army through and to wayne state university wsu through additionally upon regulatory approval of zadaxin and commercialization of the product in certain countries  the company is obligated to pay the us army and wsu the greater of the respective minimum annual royalty or a royalty based on a percentage of zadaxin sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount represents a discretionary accrued long term bonus payable to our chief executive officer as of december  based on performance targets over the years in addition to the above commitments  sciclone  as a result of its acquisition of the exclusive rights in the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp  paid a  milestone payment upon dosage of the first patient in its phase clinical trial in january  and may be obligated to pay post phase success based regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to  and royalties on future sales of rp to avantogen and resprotect 
we also have assumed and amended the terms of a certain agreement for clinical trials management services  for a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rp  previously entered into by and between avantogen oncology  inc and pharmaceutical research associates  inc pra 
the estimated cost of pra s management services and pass through costs per the amended agreement is  and  respectively  of which  had been paid by the company to pra and  was payable to pra as of december  the remaining amounts are expected to be paid to pra as incurred  through we entered into a supply agreement with resprotect to purchase rp from resprotect for clinical trials and for commercial purposes following regulatory approval 
under the terms of the supply agreement  sciclone and resprotect will share the scale up costs required to manufacture rp prior to and after fda approval 
our share of the scale up costs is estimated to be  through june  of which  was paid by us to resprotect through december  our existing capital resources and funds from product sales are sufficient to finance our operations through the first quarter of  but are not sufficient to complete our current plans to conduct and complete clinical trials with rp  scv and thymalfasin  and  if we proceed with all the development efforts we are planning  we would need to raise additional financing 
the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which would severely hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings will be sufficient to complete our 
table of contents current plans to conduct and complete clinical trials 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and the condition of the capital markets and the availability of financing for sciclone in particular 
we are exploring various alternatives for financing in addition to sales of equity of sciclone  including a line of credit  debt financing and financing of our chinese operations either through debt  equity or joint venture transactions  but we have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction 
related party transactions there are no officers or directors that were involved in related party transactions in we have licensed to our largest shareholder  sigma tau  exclusive zadaxin development and marketing rights to include all countries in the european union as of march we have also entered into an agreement with sigma tau related to the clinical development of zadaxin and we received  in the first quarter of related to this agreement 
this contract revenue was recognized over the estimated time to complete the zadaxin us phase hcv clinical trials and deliver the clinical data  the substantive performance requirements under the contract 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized contract revenue of  and  respectively  related to this agreement 
no contract revenue was recognized in related to this agreement 
we have also entered into an agreement with sigma tau  whereby sigma tau is conducting a multi center phase hepatitis c triple therapy clinical trial in europe with patients 
the objective of the european trial is to provide data on thymalfasin s use as part of a triple therapy in treating hcv patients 
we are providing sigma tau approximately  of funding support during the course of patient enrollment and trial period of which  has been paid through december  and the remaining  will be paid upon completion of the trial 
we will also pay a  milestone payment upon completion of the final report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit  us treasury  or us government agency notes and highly rated  highly liquid short term municipal securities which have an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
the short term municipal securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all of our investments mature within one year from date of purchase except for the auction rate securities whose ultimate maturities range from to years 
our holdings in short term investments  of any one issue  do not exceed of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investments in our investment securities are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term notes and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities 
this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
in february and march  we began observing the failed auctions of auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans  and each of our six auction rate securities experienced a failed auction for a combined  as of december   we held approximately  of auction rate 
table of contents securities within our available for sale short term investments classified as current assets whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans  substantially backed by the federal government 
our auction rate securities comprised approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  as of february   we held  of auction rate securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans 
if the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio continue to experience failed auctions  our ability to liquidate our investments and fully recover the carrying value of our investments in the near term may be limited or not exist and we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until stability is restored with respect to these securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
although  all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating  by a rating agency  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value which range from to years 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our business plan in the next months 
substantially all our sales and most of our manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
however  our purchases from one of our contract manufacturers are denominated in euros and costs of our marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
in addition  we have certain cash balances denominated in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations  and we do not hedge against the risk associated with such fluctuations 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could unpredictably  materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price and could result in exchange losses  although such losses have been insignificant to date
