item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties described in item a of this report 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties 
overview our business we develop and commercialize scientific business intelligence software and solutions that enable our customers to accelerate the discovery and development of new drugs and materials 
our customers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other life science companies  as well as companies that are in the energy  chemicals  aerospace and consumer packaged goods markets 
our software and service solutions are used by our customers scientists  biologists  chemists and information technology professionals in order to aggregate  mine  integrate  analyze  simulate  manage and interactively report scientific data 
our customers include leading commercial  government and academic organizations 
many of the largest pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical  energy  aerospace and consumer packaged goods companies worldwide use our software 
we market our products and services worldwide  principally through our direct sales force  augmented by the use of third party distributors 
our marketplace historically  we have primarily sold molecular modeling and simulation software 
the market for molecular modeling and simulation products in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is challenging due to the maturity of the market  industry consolidation  reduction in the level of discovery research activity  and increased competition  including competition from open source software 
we also sell modeling and simulation products to the energy  aerospace  chemical  and consumer packaged goods industries 
we believe these industries are in the early stages of adoption of these technologies 
thus we believe the market for our products within these industries is nascent 
following the acquisition of scitegic  we began to offer data pipelining and workflow software 
this technology is widely applicable within our target industries and represents a significant growth opportunity in all industries which our computer aided modeling and simulation and cheminformatics products currently serve 
there is currently limited competition with this technology in our targeted industries 
our strategy we believe the combination of our scientific operating platform and our computer aided design modeling and simulation software and service solutions enables our customers to better utilize their scientific data in order to solve critical business issues throughout their organizations 
our strategy is to continue to increase the use of our scientific operating platform so that it remains the de facto standard scientific operating platform in the industries we serve 
in order to increase the use of our platform we continue to develop advanced analysis and reporting component collections which operate with our scientific operating platform in order to extend its capabilities and value to our customers 
our scientific operating platform is also the basis of many of our service offerings  including offerings which integrate and enhance our customers software  thereby further increasing the use and value of our platform 
because our scientific operating platform is the underlying operating platform for many products in our broad portfolio of computer aided design modeling and simulation software and service solutions  we expect the usage of these products to increase as the usage of our scientific operating platform increases  thus further increasing our sales and value to our customers 
we also intend to market and distribute 
table of contents our solutions to a broader group of users  including scientists  engineers and information technology professionals within our existing customer base  as well as to new customers in other industries 
we also partner with other companies who provide scientific software and services in order to ensure that their software and service solutions operate with our scientific operating platform  further proliferating its use and value to our customers 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we generate revenue from the following primary sources software licenses  post contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software  collectively referred to as pcs  and professional services 
customer billings generated in connection with our revenue generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
we then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and when all of the following criteria are met a fully executed written contract and or purchase order has been obtained from the customer ie  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract ie  price is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist  and collection of the purchase price from the customer is considered probable 
software licenses 
we license software predominantly on a term basis 
when sold perpetually  our standard perpetual software licensing arrangements include twelve months of bundled pcs  while our standard term based software licensing arrangements typically include pcs for the full duration of the term license 
because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of these elements  we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual and term based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled pcs 

table of contents renewal of pcs under perpetual software licenses 
our pcs includes the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements and technical support 
fees from customer renewals of pcs related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the pcs 
professional services 
we provide certain services to our customers  including non complex product training  installation  implementation and other professional services which are non essential to the operation of the software 
we also perform professional services for our customers designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a client s specific business needs 
when sold separately  revenue from these services is recorded under the proportional performance or completed performance method 
multi element arrangements 
for multi element arrangements which include software licenses  pcs and non complex training  installation and implementation services which are non essential to the operation of the software  the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or delivery of the services  whichever is longer 
for multi element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation of the software  the fee for such arrangements is generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed  at which point the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the pcs or the delivery of the non essential services  whichever is longer 
valuation of goodwill our goodwill resulted from acquisitions in fiscal years through in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit 
our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the guidance provided by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  management has determined that our company consists of one reporting unit given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations and the common nature of the products  services and customers 
because we have only one reporting unit  and we are publicly traded  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value 
our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as of march  to our market capitalization 
because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization  our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of our common stock 
for example  a significant decline in the price of our common stock may cause the fair value of our goodwill to fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of scitegic in september  we acquired the scitegic trade name which was determined to be indefinitely lived 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our indefinite lived 
table of contents intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of an asset 
our indefinite lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test and concluded that our indefinite lived intangible asset was not impaired 
we estimated the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific operating platform and the associated direct and incremental selling  marketing  and product development costs 
key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific operating platform and developing an appropriate discount rate 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s undiscounted future cash flows  we utilize our internal forecast of our future operating results and cash flows  our strategic business plans and anticipated future economic and market conditions 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying this information and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows will materialize as anticipated 
as a result of the closure of our research and development facility in bangalore  india in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we assessed the recoverability of the associated property and equipment and determined that a portion of the assets were not recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the asset impairment charges in each period represent the carrying value of these assets as we expect that any amount we will recover from their disposal will be negligible 
valuation of marketable securities we assess our marketable securities for impairment under the guidance provided by fasb staff position nos 
and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain 
table of contents investments 
accordingly  we review the fair value of our marketable securities at least quarterly to determine if declines in the fair value of individual securities are other than temporary in nature 
if we believe the decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value  generally determined using quoted market prices  with a corresponding charge to the income statement 
to determine if a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  among others  the period of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost  overall market conditions  the historical and projected future financial condition of the issuer of the security and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of the market value 
as of march   we held million in auction rate securities ars  all of which are collateralized by student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government and are aaa rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
since february  all auctions for the ars we hold have failed as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result of the failed auctions and our inability to value the ars based on quoted market prices  the fair values of these securities were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows  and the estimated time until anticipated market recovery 
based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  creditworthiness of the issuers of the ars  and our belief that we presently have the ability and the intent to hold these investments until market recovery  we do not believe these securities to be other than temporarily impaired  and as such  we have recorded an unrealized loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income as of march  valuation of share based awards we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r  effective april   using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognized as a charge against income the estimated grant date fair value of share based awards granted to employees and directors 
we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected life of the award  giving consideration to company specific events impacting our historical volatility that are unlikely to occur in the future  such as the april  spin off of pdd  as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility 
we also consider the historical stock price volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the interest rates on us constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
we determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors  including the vesting period and contractual term of the award  our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service  the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee characteristics 
we also consider the expected award lives of comparable publicly traded companies 
for stock purchase plan purchase rights  the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the stock purchase plan 

table of contents under sfas no 
r  we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience  giving consideration to company specific events impacting historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates 
our determination of the input variables used in the black scholes option pricing model as well as the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price  among other factors 
changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our share based awards and  therefore  the amount of share based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs 
in such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities 
although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such determination is made 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we expect that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax reserves 
our reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of our tax audits 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions  if any  and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest and penalties 
favorable resolution of such an income tax matter would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in the expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors  among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies  reversing deferred tax liabilities and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
since our inception  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 effective april  fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
on april   we reversed a previously recorded income tax reserve with a corresponding adjustment to beginning retained earnings of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our adoption of the provisions of fin no

cost of revenue decreased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to for the year ended march   as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in fulfillment costs of million driven by an increase in fiscal year of electronic software distribution to our customers 
we also incurred approximately million less in royalty costs and distributor commissions  primarily due to a more favorable product mix  but partially impacted by a slight decrease in sales volume year over year 
additionally  a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the scitegic acquisition in september became fully amortized in fiscal year  resulting in a year over year decrease in purchased intangible asset amortization of approximately million

as a result of the restructuring  we recognized a charge of million  consisting of million in severance benefits and million in asset 
table of contents impairment and other facility closure costs 
all severance and facility closure costs have been paid as of march  additionally  in fiscal year we incurred additional lease abandonment charges of million and million in severance charges related to restructuring activities originated in previous periods 
in march  we implemented various actions designed to realign our resources with our portfolio of products and services  eliminate redundancies in our workforce and streamline our operations through workforce reductions and abandoning a portion of a leased facility in the united kingdom 
as a result of the implementation of these actions  we recognized a charge of million  consisting of million in severance benefits from the termination of approximately employees and million for our future lease obligations related to the abandoned facility  net of estimated future sublease income

table of contents as of march   we held million in ars collateralized by student loans  most of which were originated under the federal family education loan program and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days and have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
despite the underlying long term nature of ars  such securities have historically been priced and traded as short term investments because of the liquidity provided through the auction process 
if there are insufficient buyers  auctions are said to fail and the holders are unable to liquidate the investments through auction 
a failed auction does not result in a default of the debt instrument 
the securities continue to accrue interest and be auctioned until the next auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature 
since february  all auctions for the ars we hold have failed as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result of the failed auctions and our inability to value the ars based on quoted market prices  the fair values of these securities were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows  and the estimated time until anticipated market recovery 
based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  creditworthiness of the issuers of the ars  and our belief that we presently have the ability and the intent to hold these investments until market recovery  we do not believe these securities to be other than temporarily impaired  and as such  we have recorded an unrealized loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income as of march  nonetheless  if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  deteriorate further or there are any ratings downgrades on any ars we hold  or if we no longer have the ability to hold these investments  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge against net income 
as the market for student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified these investments as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  in the event that we need to access our investments in these auction rate securities  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the outstanding securities  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities mature  or there is a default requiring immediate payment from the issuer 
we do not believe that our inability to access these funds in the near term will have a material impact on our liquidity for the next twelve months 
we have funded our activities to date primarily through the sales of software licenses and related services and the issuance of equity securities 
we anticipate that our capital requirements may increase in future periods as a result of seasonal sales trends  additional product development activities and the acquisition of additional equipment 
our capital requirements may also increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  the purchase of additional capital equipment and acquisitions of other businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary 

table of contents contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations as of march  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases  net of subleases minimum royalty payments total for purposes of the contractual obligations table  we have included indefinite lived contractual minimum royalty payments due in the ten fiscal years following fiscal year we are obligated to pay royalties for licenses to enhance and market certain software used in connection with our product offerings 
in addition to the contractual minimum royalties included in the table above  we have several royalty agreements that are long term or perpetual in nature with royalty obligations that are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales and associated sales of pcs 
the royalty agreements require quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalties owed 
during the years ended march   and  we incurred royalty expenses of million  million  and million  respectively 
our future annual royalty obligations will vary based on the volume and mix of our product sales and  as a result  may increase in the future 
on april   relating to the spin off of pdd  the landlords of our new jersey facilities  which were used by our pdd operations  consented to the assignment of the leases to pdd 
despite the assignment  the landlords required us to guarantee the remaining lease obligations  which totaled approximately million as of march  in accordance with fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we recognized a liability and corresponding charge to stockholders equity for the probability weighted fair market value of the guarantee 
changes to the fair market value of the liability are recognized in stockholders equity 
the liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation as of march  and was million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of march   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations applying the acquisition method 
sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations  but provides additional guidance on applying the acquisition method when accounting for similar economic events 
it establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r was a joint effort between the fasb and the 
table of contents international accounting standards board to promote global standards by improving the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for acquisitions occurring in or subsequent to fiscal years following december  we will assess the impact of sfas no 
r if and when a future acquisition occurs 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
also amends certain provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
provides a definition of fair value  establishes acceptable methods of measuring fair value and expands disclosures for fair value measurements 
the principles apply under accounting pronouncements which require measurement of fair value and do not require any new fair value measurements in accounting pronouncements where fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to our us operations  we have operations in europe and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the pound sterling  euro and yen exchange rates 
many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in currency exchange rates 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables  along with the settlement of certain intercompany transactions  are included in the determination of net income 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we do not currently have hedging contracts in effect since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
the majority of our software license agreements are denominated in us dollars 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
none of our investments are held for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to the relatively short maturities of these investments 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our results of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
as of march   we held million in ars collateralized by student loans  most of which were originated under the federal family education loan program and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days and have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
despite the underlying long term nature of 
table of contents ars  such securities have historically been priced and traded as short term investments because of the liquidity provided through the auction process 
if there are insufficient buyers  auctions are said to fail and the holders are unable to liquidate the investments through auction 
a failed auction does not result in a default of the debt instrument 
the securities continue to accrue interest and be auctioned until the next auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature 
since february  all auctions for the ars we hold have failed as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result of the failed auctions and our inability to value the ars based on quoted market prices  the fair values of these securities were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows  and the estimated time until anticipated market recovery 
based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  creditworthiness of the issuers of the ars  and our belief that we presently have the ability and the intent to hold these investments until market recovery  we do not believe these securities to be other than temporarily impaired  and as such  we have recorded an unrealized loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income as of march  nonetheless  if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  deteriorate further or there are any ratings downgrades on any ars we hold  or if we no longer have the ability to hold these investments  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge against net income 
as the market for student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified these investments as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  in the event that we need to access our investments in these auction rate securities  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the outstanding securities  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities mature  or there is a default requiring immediate payment from the issuer 
we do not believe that our inability to access these funds in the near term will have a material impact on our liquidity for the next twelve months
