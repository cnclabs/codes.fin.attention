qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk  and item a 
risk factors we may continue to enter into derivative transactions to manage the price risks associated with our production 
our derivative transactions may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from benefiting from increases in prices for natural gas and oil 
competition and technological changes we encounter competition from other natural gas and oil companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have been engaged in the natural gas and oil business for much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
we may not be able to conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment 
the natural gas and oil industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
regulation natural gas and oil operations are subject to various federal  state  local and international environmental regulations that may change from time to time  including regulations governing natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control and state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit 
these regulations may affect the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other regulated transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the following discussion summarizes the regulation of the united states oil and gas industry 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject  although we cannot assure you that this is or will remain the case 
moreover  those statutes  rules  regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and any such changes or reinterpretations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject 
regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels that require permits for the drilling of wells  mandate that we maintain bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulate the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations 

table of contents our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the density of wells that may be drilled in natural gas and oil properties and the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties 
in this regard  some states including louisiana allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states including texas rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary  it may be more difficult to form units and therefore more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than of the leasehold 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
because these laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended and reinterpreted  we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act of nga  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
effective january   the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  including all of our sales of our own production 
as a result  all of our domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 
the ferc s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation  however  was not affected by the decontrol act 
under the nga  facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe satisfy the ferc s criteria for establishing that these are all gathering facilities not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental  and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation 
although we therefore do not own or operate any pipelines or facilities that are directly regulated by the ferc  its regulations of third party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to market our production 
beginning in the s the ferc initiated a series of major restructuring orders that required pipelines  among other things  to perform open access transportation  unbundle their sales and transportation functions  and allow shippers to release their pipeline capacity to other shippers 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties 
we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while  at the same time  substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
it remains to be seen  however  what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets  the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business 
we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities 
in the past  congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation 
however  the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation or lighter handed regulation and the promotion of competition in the gas industry 
in light of this increased reliance on competition  the energy policy act of amended the nga to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the transportation  purchase or sale of natural gas 
in addition to the regulations implementing these prohibitions  the ferc has established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through  among other things  expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold  and has proposed new regulations that would require both interstate pipelines and certain non interstate pipelines to post daily information regarding their capacity  scheduled flow volumes  and actual flow volumes at certain points on their systems 
the energy policy act of also significantly increases the penalties for violations of the nga to up to million per day for each violation 
there regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures which  if enacted  would significantly affect the petroleum industry 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect  if any  such proposals might have on us 
similarly  and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry  whether or to what extent that trend will continue  or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas  cannot be predicted 
oil price controls and transportation rates our sales of oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective as of january   the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system 
table of contents for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to specified conditions and limitations 
these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting natural gas and oil liquids by interstate pipeline  although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year 
every five years  the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry 
in march  to implement the second of the required five yearly re determinations  the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes 
the ferc determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus percent ppi plus percent should be the oil pricing index for the five year period beginning july  we are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or ferc proceedings  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on specified lands within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions prohibiting or limiting the extent of our operations 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
the trend of applying more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations to the natural gas and oil industry could continue  resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting our profitability 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we generate waste that may be subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the us environmental protection agency epa  and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous waste 
furthermore  certain waste generated by our natural gas and oil operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous waste may in the future be designated as hazardous waste and therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
we currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of natural gas and oil 
although we believe that we have implemented appropriate operating and waste disposal practices  prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices  and hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we own or lease or on or under locations where such waste have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other waste was not under our control 
these properties and the waste disposed thereon may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of natural gas and oil waste 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
see item a 
risk factors we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on specified classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these classes of persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
our operations may be subject to the clean air act caa and comparable state and local requirements 
in congress adopted amendments to the caa containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations 
the epa and states have developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission related issues 
however  we do not believe our operations will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements 

table of contents federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil  such as us  to prepare and implement spill prevention  control  countermeasure spcc and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters 
the oil pollution act of opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill  including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 
the opa also requires owners and operators of offshore facilities that could be the source of an oil spill into federal or state waters  including wetlands  to post a bond  letter of credit or other form of financial assurance in amounts ranging from million in specified state waters to million in federal outer continental shelf waters to cover costs that could be incurred by governmental authorities in responding to an oil spill 
these financial assurances may be increased by as much as million if a formal risk assessment indicates that the increase is warranted 
noncompliance with opa may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities 
our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act cwa and analogous state laws 
in accordance with the cwa  the state of louisiana issued regulations prohibiting discharges of produced water in state coastal waters effective july  pursuant to other requirements of the cwa  the epa has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff 
this program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits or seek coverage under an epa general permit 
like opa  the cwa and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground 
we also are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and international permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our offshore operations in the uk north sea and onshore operations in the us are subject to similar regulations covering permit requirements and the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
coalbed methane proceedings in montana the issuance of new coalbed methane drilling permits in montana was halted temporarily pending the federal bureau of land management s blm approval of a final record of decision on montana s resource management plan environmental impact statement and the montana department of environmental quality s approval of a statewide oil and gas environmental impact statement 
these two program approvals were obtained in april and august of  respectively 
environmental groups initiated six lawsuits  challenging these program approvals 
on february   the federal district court for the district of montana issued an opinion in northern plains resource council v 
blm and a companion case vacating blm s approval of the state plan and remanding the plan to blm for further consideration 
the court further entered an order limiting the issuance of federal drilling permits to per year and placed additional restrictions on certain operations 
various parties appealed these orders to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on may   the ninth circuit entered an order halting the issuance of any new permits pending their review of the parties various appeals 
oral argument was held in the case on september  on september   the ninth circuit affirmed the trial court s issuance of the partial injunction limiting the issuance of drilling permits and withdrew the total ban on issuing permits entered by the court of appeals 
during the pendency of the ninth circuit case  on february   in response to the orders issued by the federal district court for the district of montana  blm published the draft supplement to the montana statewide oil and gas environmental impact statement and amendment to the powder river and billings resource management plan seis 
public comments were received on the draft seis on may  on june   blm responded to epa concerns regarding the analysis of air quality impacts in the draft seis by committing to prepare supplemental air quality analyses for public comment by september on december   blm issued the supplemental air quality analyses for public comment 
this public comment period will end on march  the draft seis attempts to address the federal district court s concerns 
although this decision could result in a continued suspension of the state s authority to issue new drilling permits or could effect the continued viability of existing permits in montana  we believe that the decisions by the federal bureau of land management and the state of montana ultimately will be upheld on appeal and or blm s reconsideration will address the federal district court s concerns and new coalbed methane development will continue to be authorized in montana 
there can be no assurance that any new permits will be obtained in a given time period or at all 
global climate change 
table of contents in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the current session of the us congress is considering climate change related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions 
one bill recently approved by the us senate environment and public works committee  known as the lieberman warner climate security act or s  would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between and the lieberman warner bill proposes a cap and trade scheme of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that generally would ban emissions above a defined reducing annual cap 
covered parties would be authorized to emit greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be traded or acquired on the open market 
a vote on this bill by the full senate is expected to occur before mid year in addition  at least states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs require either major sources of emissions  such as electric power plants  or major producers of fuels  such as refineries or gas processing plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances 
the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved 
depending on the particular program  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances  either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of oil or natural gas we produce 
although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated producers of oil and gas  a stringent greenhouse gas control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce 
also  as a result of the us supreme court s decision in april in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency  the epa may be required to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks  even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
the epa has indicated that it will issue a rulemaking notice to address carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and automobile fuels  although the date for issuance of this notice has not been finalized 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant may also result in future regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under certain clean air act programs 
new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed in areas of the united states in which we conduct business could also adversely affect our cost of doing business and demand for the oil and gas we produce 
in addition to the effects of future regulation  the meteorological effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our onshore and offshore operations in the form of more frequent and or more intense storms and flooding  which could in turn adversely affect our cost of doing business 
operating hazards and insurance the natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks that could result in substantial losses to us from  among other things  injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  cleanup responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not carry business interruption insurance or protect against loss of revenues 
we cannot assure you that any insurance we obtain will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
we may elect to self insure if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we participate in a substantial percentage of our wells on a nonoperated basis  and may be accordingly limited in our ability to control the risks associated with natural gas and oil operations 
title to properties  acquisition risks 
table of contents we believe we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the natural gas and oil industry 
our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of these properties 
as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties  we make little investigation of record title at the time of acquisition other than a preliminary review of local records 
investigations  including a title opinion of local counsel  are generally made before commencement of drilling operations 
our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our natural gas and oil properties 
in acquiring producing properties  we assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors our future acquisitions may yield revenues or production that varies significantly from our projections 
customers the company sold oil and natural gas production representing more than of its oil and natural gas revenues as follows year ended december  cokinos natural gas company reichmann petroleum chevron texaco houston pipeline company energy transfer crosstex energy because alternate purchasers of oil and natural gas are readily available  we believe that the loss of any of our purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
employees at december   we had full time employees  including eight landmen  six geoscientists and seven engineers 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good 
in order to optimize prospect generation and development  we utilize the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of d seismic data mapping  acquisition of leases and lease options  construction  design  well site surveillance  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors generally provide field and on site production operation services  such as pumping  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and testings 
we believe that this use of third party service providers has enhanced our ability to contain general and administrative expenses 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel and the loss of any could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees

item a 
risk factors natural gas and oil drilling is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs that could adversely affect us 
our success will be largely dependent upon the success of our drilling program 
drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be discovered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control  including unexpected or adverse drilling conditions  elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs  crews and equipment 
because we identify the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data covering large areas  we may not seek to acquire an option or lease rights until after the seismic data is analyzed or until the drilling locations are also identified  in those cases  we may not be permitted to lease  drill or produce natural gas or oil from those locations 
even if drilled  our completed wells may not produce reserves of natural gas or oil that are economically viable or that meet our earlier estimates of economically recoverable reserves 
our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular project area may decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially harm our operations and financial condition by reducing our available cash and resources 
because of the risks and uncertainties of our business  our future performance in exploration and drilling may not be comparable to our historical performance described in this form k 
we may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule 
our final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors  including 
table of contents the results of our exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of the seismic data  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects  the approval of the prospects by the other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and crews  and the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
although we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects  we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame or at all 
wells that are currently part of our capital budget may be based on statistical results of drilling activities in other d project areas that we believe are geologically similar rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the prospect area  in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary  possibly materially  from those statistical results 
in addition  our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties 
our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating natural gas and oil reserves and their estimated value  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in this form k represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based on assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results 
accordingly  reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment  and actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary  possibly materially  from estimates 
additionally  there recently has been increased debate and disagreement over the classification of reserves  with particular focus on proved undeveloped reserves 
changes in interpretations as to classification standards  or disagreements with our interpretations  could cause us to write down these reserves 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped and proved nonproducing 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in our reserve reports as of december  had produced for a relatively short period of time as of that date 
because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
in addition  realization or recognition of our proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
lack of certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
although we have increased our development of the camp hill field in east texas  we have in the past chosen to delay development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the camp hill field in favor of pursuing shorter term exploration projects with higher potential rates of return  adding to our lease position in this field and further evaluating additional economic enhancements for this field s development 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this form k are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
as required by the commission  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas and oil  our actual operating costs in producing natural gas and oil  the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for natural gas and oil  
table of contents increases or decreases in consumption of natural gas and oil  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 
we depend on successful exploration  development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future natural gas and oil production is  therefore  highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in addition  we are dependent on finding partners for our exploratory activity 
to the extent that others in the industry do not have the financial resources or choose not to participate in our exploration activities  we will be adversely affected 
natural gas and oil prices are highly volatile  and lower prices will negatively affect our financial results 
our revenue  profitability  cash flow  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of natural gas and oil 
historically  the markets for natural gas and oil prices have been volatile  and those markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
it is impossible to predict future natural gas and oil price movements with certainty 
prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  overall economic conditions  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental relations  regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  the level and price of foreign imports of oil and liquefied natural gas  and the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain production constraints and oil price controls 
declines in natural gas and oil prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
we face strong competition from other natural gas and oil companies 
we encounter competition from other natural gas and oil companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
our competitors include major integrated natural gas and oil companies and numerous independent natural gas and oil companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have been engaged in the natural gas and oil business much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay 
table of contents more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
we may not be able to conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 
the natural gas and oil industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
as others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial cost 
in addition  other natural gas and oil companies may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks 
natural gas and oil operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign government regulations that may change from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  plug and abandonment bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of natural gas and oil wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of natural gas and oil 
other federal  state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment apply to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of natural gas and oil  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with natural gas and oil operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs 
further  we or our affiliates hold certain mineral leases in the state of montana that require coalbed methane drilling permits  the issuance of which has been challenged in pending litigation 
we may not be able to obtain new permits in an optimal time period or at all 
we also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
compliance with existing  new or modified laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to various operating and other casualty risks that could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues 
the natural gas and oil business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts  mechanical failures  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  geologic formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  releases of toxic gases  and other environmental hazards and risks 

table of contents any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can and have caused substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
our operations in the uk north sea are dependent upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change affecting these infrastructure facilities could materially harm our business 
we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or may not be available to us in the future 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities or experience reductions in revenue that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions  or result in the loss of properties 
a substantial portion of our operations is exposed to the additional risk of tropical weather disturbances 
a substantial portion of our production and reserves is located onshore south louisiana and texas 
operations in this area are subject to tropical weather disturbances 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
for example  a number of our wells in the gulf coast were shut in following hurricanes katrina and rita in in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks 
losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
we maintain insurance against losses and liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent  however  insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 
the marketability of our natural gas production depends on facilities that we typically do not own or control  which could result in a curtailment of production and revenues 

table of contents the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short term transportation agreements 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
our ability to produce and market natural gas on a commercial basis could be harmed by any significant change in the cost or availability of such markets  systems or pipelines 
our future acquisitions may yield revenues or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in acquiring producing properties  we assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel  including our executive officers and other key employees  the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of sp johnson iv  our president and chief executive officer  paul f 
boling  our vice president and chief financial officer  j 
bradley fisher  our vice president and chief operating officer  gregory e 
evans  our vice president of exploration and richard h 
smith  our vice president of land 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees 
our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel 
we may experience difficulty in achieving and managing future growth 
we have experienced growth in the past primarily through the expansion of our drilling program 
future growth may place strains on our financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors  possibly negatively affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to obtain leases or options on properties  including those for which we have d seismic data  our ability to acquire additional d seismic data  our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects  our ability to develop existing prospects  our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  our ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of our drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  and our access to capital 
we may not be successful in upgrading our technical  operations and administrative resources or in increasing our ability to internally provide certain of the services currently provided by outside sources  and we may not be able to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
our inability to achieve or manage growth may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may continue to enter into derivative transactions to manage the price risks associated with our production 
our derivative transactions may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from benefiting from increases in prices for natural gas and oil 
because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price declines associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and thereby to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production  thereby providing only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
these arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which production is less than expected  our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of natural gas and oil or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or oil prices 
we have substantial capital requirements that  if not met  may hinder operations 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital needs as a result of our active exploration  development and acquisition programs 
we expect that additional external financing will be required in the future to fund our growth 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  and financing under existing or new credit facilities may not be available in the future 
even if additional capital becomes available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
without additional capital resources  we may be forced to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program and thereby adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties  in turn negatively affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
high demand for field services and equipment and the ability of suppliers to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our oil and natural gas properties 
due to current industry demands  well service providers and related equipment and personnel are in short supply 
this is causing escalating prices  delays in drilling and other exploration activities  the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries 
such pressures will likely increase the actual cost of services  extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to any accidents sustained from the overuse of equipment and inexperienced personnel 
our credit facilities contain operating restrictions and financial covenants  and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit 
over the past few years  increases in commodity prices and proved reserve amounts and the resulting increase in our estimated discounted future net revenue have allowed us to increase our available borrowing amounts 
in the future  commodity prices may decline  we may increase our borrowings or our borrowing base may be adjusted downward  thereby reducing our borrowing capacity 
our credit facilities are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our producing natural gas and oil properties and assets  are guaranteed by our subsidiaries ccbm  inc  cllr  inc and hondo pipeline  inc 
and contain covenants that limit additional borrowings  dividends  the incurrence of liens  investments  sales or pledges of assets  changes in control  repurchases or redemptions for cash of our common stock  speculative commodity transactions and other matters 
the credit facilities also require that specified financial ratios be maintained 
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing  particularly in view of the restrictions of our credit facilities on our ability to incur additional debt and the fact that substantially all of our assets are currently pledged to secure obligations under the credit facilities 
the restrictions of our credit facilities and our difficulty in obtaining additional debt financing may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results including our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  our drilling program  purchases of new technology or other purposes may be impaired  the covenants in our credit facilities that limit our ability to borrow additional funds and dispose of assets may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  because our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates  
table of contents any additional financing we obtain may be on unfavorable terms  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations  including by curtailing portions of our drilling program  selling assets  reducing our capital expenditures  refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing  and we may become more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy 
in addition  under the terms of our credit facilities  our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semi annually based in part on prevailing natural gas and oil prices 
in the event the amount outstanding exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings 
we may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell a portion of our assets 
we may record ceiling limitation write downs that would reduce our shareholders equity 
we use the full cost method of accounting for investments in natural gas and oil properties 
accordingly  we capitalize all the direct costs of acquiring  exploring for and developing natural gas and oil properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of natural gas and oil properties may not exceed a ceiling limit that is based on the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of the cost or the fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this charge is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities but does reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues  as further discussed in our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
once incurred  a write down of natural gas and oil properties is not reversible at a later date 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of critical accounting policies for additional information on these matters 
we participate in oil and natural gas leases with third parties 
we may own less than of the working interest in certain leases acquired by us  and other parties will own the remaining portion of the working interest 
financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling  equipping  completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person 
we could be held liable for the joint activity obligations of the other working interest owners such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the working interest owners 
in the event other working interest owners do not pay their share of such costs  we would likely have to pay those costs  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
we may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies 
we purchase working and revenue interests in the natural gas and oil leasehold interests upon which we will perform our exploration activities from third parties or directly from the mineral fee owners 
the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not generally available and  in all instances  we forego the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be placed under lease or already placed under lease until the drilling block is assembled and ready to be drilled 
as is customary in our industry  we rely upon the judgment of natural gas and oil lease brokers or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest 
we  in some cases  perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title to us 
the work might include obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered 
in cases involving more serious title problems  the amount paid for affected natural gas and oil leases can be generally lost  and the target area can become undrillable 

table of contents we have risks associated with our foreign operations 
we currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
the threat and impact of terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations 
we cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  either in the short term or in the long term 
uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines and gathering systems  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war
