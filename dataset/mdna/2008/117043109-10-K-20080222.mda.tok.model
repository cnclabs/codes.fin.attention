overview and outlook general in  brunswick made significant progress toward achieving its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling billiards industries by introducing high quality and reliable products with innovative and new technologies in all of brunswick s market segments  distributing products through a model that benefits the company s dealers and distributors by providing additional products and services that will make them more successful  improve the customer experience and  in turn  make brunswick more successful  focusing on cost reduction initiatives through global sourcing and realignment of brunswick s manufacturing operations and organizational structure  and continuing to expand and enhance brunswick s global manufacturing footprint to achieve best cost positions 
accomplishments in support of the company s strategic objectives in include new products a suite of products collectively referred to as mercruiser and branded zeus  axius and total command  which focus on maneuverability and handling of recreational marine vessels across a broad range of pod  sterndrive and inboard vessel applications to address the challenge of handling and close quarters maneuverability of marine vessels  the transition of sterndrive and inboard engines that now incorporate catalytic converters  which reduce their environmental impact and bring the engines into compliance with the regulations adopted by the state of california  new boat models across all boat brands  many of which utilize brunswick s high performance product development hppd process to integrate the design  engineering and manufacturing processes from start to finish  new cardiovascular and strength training fitness product offerings  including life fitness all new elevation series of treadmills and upgraded cardiovascular equipment that deliver seamless ipod integration  and continued expansion of the larger brunswick zone xl family bowling entertainment centers 
manufacturing realignment adjustments to the manufacturing footprint to streamline operations  including the purchase of a manufacturing facility in navassa  north carolina  to expand its capacity to build larger boats and to allow for the closure of the salisbury  maryland  facility  announcement of the closure of the aluminum manufacturing facility in aberdeen  mississippi  and shifting of production to other existing aluminum facilities  completion of the transition of bowling ball manufacturing operations from muskegon  michigan  to reynosa  mexico  and completion of the relocation of brunswick s valley dynamo manufacturing operations from richland hills  texas  to reynosa  mexico  where production commenced in acquisitions the company exercised its option to purchase the remaining percent interest of rayglass sales marketing limited rayglass  a new zealand company  which expands the global manufacturing footprint of the company s marine operations and develops additional international sales opportunities 
international operations increased investments in operations in europe  the pacific rim and latin america supporting international sales  which now represent approximately percent of net sales from continuing operations 
returning value to shareholders continued purchases under a million share repurchase program  buying back approximately million shares of brunswick common stock for approximately million during  and payment of an annual dividend of per share 
despite its success in executing these objectives  brunswick saw a decline in its financial performance due to difficult marine market conditions 
net sales from continuing operations in increased slightly to  million from  net sales in were comparable with net sales as the strong performance outside the united states  growth in the fitness segment and higher sales of marine parts and accessories were mostly offset by the continued reduction in united states marine industry demand 
organic sales  defined as sales from the company s businesses that have operating results in comparable periods  declined percent from operating earnings from continuing operations for of million  and operating margins of percent  decreased from operating earnings from continuing operations of and operating margins of percent  primarily as a result of lower sales from the boat segment  reduced fixed cost absorption as a result of reduced production rates in the company s marine businesses in an effort to achieve appropriate levels of dealer pipeline inventories  higher raw material and production costs  increased promotional incentives at the boat segment  and unfavorable mix factors 
also contributing to the decline in both operating earnings and margins was a million pre tax indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of  as discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these factors were partially offset by successful cost reduction initiatives  as discussed in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the company also incurred additional costs for investments in research and development  marketing for new product launches and international operations to support future growth 
see the results of operations section below for further discussion 
discontinued operations as discussed in note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on april   the company announced its intention to sell the majority of the brunswick new technologies bnt business unit  consisting of the company s marine electronics  portable navigation device pnd and wireless fleet tracking businesses 
during the second quarter of  brunswick began reporting the results of these bnt businesses  which were previously reported in the marine engine segment  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company s results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis  reflect continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
in march  brunswick completed the sales of bnt s marine electronics and pnd businesses to navico international ltd 
and mitac international corporation  respectively  for net proceeds of million 
a million after tax gain was recognized with the divestiture of these businesses in in july  the company completed the sale of bnt s wireless fleet tracking business to navman wireless holdings lp for net proceeds of million  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
the company has now completed the divestiture of the bnt discontinued operations 
with the net asset impairment taken prior to the disposition of the bnt businesses in the fourth quarter of of million  after tax  and the subsequent gains of million  after tax  on the bnt business sales  the net impact to the company of these dispositions was a net loss of million  after tax 
outlook for looking ahead to  the company expects domestic marine retail demand to be down as compared to as a result of this reduction in retail demand  brunswick will continue its efforts to achieve appropriate levels of dealer inventories by reducing production of boats and marine engines 
however  the company anticipates that sales will benefit from the introduction of new products and the continued growth of sales outside the united states 
sales for in both the fitness and bowling billiards segments are expected to increase as a result of new product launches at the fitness segment and the continued roll out of the brunswick zone xl model at bowling billiards 
these factors provide some insight to expected sales  which will largely depend on the united states marine industry retail demand  which is difficult to predict 
operating earnings and margins for will be adversely affected by the reduction in marine retail demand and the corresponding continued production declines  as discussed above 
these actions will have an unfavorable effect on margins due to lower fixed cost absorption 
additionally  with the restructuring of specific business operations and the potential for further reduction in marine retail demand in  an impairment review of affected business assets may be required 
an adverse outcome from a future review could directly affect operating earnings and margins 
these factors  along with continued increases in raw materials  production  and freight and distribution costs  are not expected to be fully offset by growth in international operations and cost containment efforts during excluding the effect of any tax related items that may occur  brunswick s effective tax rate in is expected to increase into the mid percent range as congress has not yet extended the research and development tax credit into matters affecting comparability as described above  certain statements in management s discussion and analysis are based on non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
operating and statistical measures are not non gaap financial measures 
the company has used the non gaap financial measures that are included in management s discussion and analysis for several years 
brunswick s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view brunswick s performance using the same tools that brunswick uses and to better evaluate its ongoing business performance

vs 
the increase in net sales was primarily due to the strong performance of boat and engine sales outside the united states  higher fitness segment sales resulting from increased sales volumes  higher sales of marine parts and accessories  and sales gains at bowling retail centers 
these factors slightly outpaced the impact of continued reduction in united states marine industry demand 
organic sales decreased percent in compared with  primarily due to lower united states retail demand for marine products 
sales outside the united states increased million to  million in  with the largest contributions coming from the european region  which increased million to  million  the latin american region  which increased million to million  and the asia pacific region  which increased million to million 
this growth was largely attributable to higher sales of engines  fitness equipment and boats 
brunswick s gross margin percentage decreased basis points in to percent from percent in this decrease was the result of lower fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies due to reduced production rates as a result of the company s effort to achieve appropriate levels of marine customer pipeline inventories in light of lower retail demand  higher raw material and component costs  increased promotional incentives  restructuring expenses and unfavorable warranty experiences in the boat segment  and a mix shift toward lower horsepower four stroke engines manufactured by a joint venture that carry lower margins 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by successful cost reduction efforts  the benefit of a weaker dollar and increased world wide sales volume in the fitness segment 
operating expenses increased million to  million in  due to the million impairment charge taken on indefinite lived intangible assets  as discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements  higher variable compensation expense  inflation and the effects of a weaker dollar  the absence of the gains on sales of property sold in and the absence of a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier on environmental coverage received in operating earnings decreased to million in from million in the decrease in operating earnings was mainly due to the decline in boat segment sales volumes and the unfavorable factors affecting gross margin and operating expenses discussed above

vs 
the increase in sales was primarily due to million from acquisitions completed in and in the boat and marine engine segments  higher fitness segment sales resulting from increased sales volumes and improved product mix  and sales gains at bowling retail centers 
organic sales decreased percent in  primarily due to lower retail demand for marine products compared with  especially with respect to sales of domestic outboard engines and fiberglass boats 
these decreases were partially offset by growth in non us sales in the boat  marine engine and fitness segments  as well as favorable pricing 
non us sales increased million to  million in  with the largest contributions coming from the latin american region  which increased million to million  and the africa and middle east region  which increased million to million 
this growth was largely attributable to higher sales of fitness equipment  boats and outboard engines 
brunswick s gross margin percentage decreased basis points in to percent from percent in this decrease was the result of higher raw material and component costs  lower fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies due to reduced production rates as a result of the company s effort to achieve appropriate levels of marine customer pipeline inventories in light of lower retail demand  and the full year effect of the transition to low emission outboard engines  which carry lower margins than the carbureted two stroke outboards they replaced 
gross margin also decreased due to a shift in product mix  as sales volumes decreased in some of the higher margin fiberglass boat lines  and higher sales from acquired businesses  which have lower margins than brunswick s core brands 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin percentage was a restructuring charge of million recorded during the fourth quarter of for severance costs  asset write downs and other costs associated with workforce reductions  plant shutdowns and distribution realignment actions 
total pre tax restructuring charges recognized during the fourth quarter under this initiative were million  of which million was recorded in operating expenses 
the remaining balance of million was related to asset write downs associated with a joint venture and recorded against equity earnings 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable pricing and lower variable compensation expense 
operating expenses increased million to million in  primarily due to the effect of acquisitions  the million restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as discussed above  the unfavorable effect of inflation on wages and benefits  the absence of a reduction in marine engine segment bad debt reserves that occurred in the third quarter of resulting from improved credit experience in international markets  a reduction in gains associated with the sale of bowling centers  and increased investments in research and development expenses  particularly in the marine engine and fitness segments 
these increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense  a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier on environmental coverage  the absence of legal expenses incurred in related to a dispute with a supplier in china as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  lower costs associated with the transition of bowling ball production from michigan to reynosa  mexico  and other cost reduction initiatives

in  the company recognized million of tax benefits  primarily due to refinements in the calculation of prior years extraterritorial income tax benefit  the reassessment of tax reserves for underlying exposures and the company s apb assertion to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  as discussed above 
in addition  brunswick utilized previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards on the gain on the sale of marinemax stock as discussed above 
the tax rate was further affected by foreign earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
refer to note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details with respect to these tax benefits 
both the and effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate as a result of the research and development tax credit and the extraterritorial income tax benefit 
net earnings and diluted earnings per share decreased primarily due to the same factors discussed above in operating earnings 
weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share decreased to million in from million in the decrease in average shares outstanding was primarily due to the repurchase of approximately million shares during  as well as the full year benefit of share repurchases  as discussed in note share repurchase program in the notes to consolidated financial statements

environmental regulation in its marine engine segment  brunswick will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california adopted regulations that required catalytic converters on sterndrive and inboard engines that became effective on january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for those regions 
the company expects to comply fully with these regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products for the company and the industry 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  fitness equipment  bowling products and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability and revenue is adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance result in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in assessing the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  management relies on a number of factors to value anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to value and discount cash flows are dependent upon royalty rate assumptions  interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that operating results or assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
postretirement benefit reserves 
postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
postretirement benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
effective december   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company historically provided deferred taxes on the undistributed net earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
as of july   the company determined that certain foreign subsidiaries undistributed net earnings were to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the united states  and accordingly  us income taxes are no longer provided for the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries 
the company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the company s tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
the company manages foreign currency exposure of assets or liabilities through the use of derivative financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument offsets the loss or gain recognized on the asset or liability  respectively 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs on current or anticipated issuances of debt 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to its outstanding debt 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps  forward starting floating to fixed interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements  futures contracts and supplier agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
the company uses a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with nonlinear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company would incur on its derivative financial instruments from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency rates  interest rates  and commodity prices
