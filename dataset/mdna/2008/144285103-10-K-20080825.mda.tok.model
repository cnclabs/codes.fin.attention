item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of factors that affect the comparability of the selected financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of business strategy and certain trends this overview is intended to provide a context for the following discussions  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all discussions of operating results reflect continuing operations 
general business approach carpenter is engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  cobalt  titanium  chromium  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire  narrow strip  special shapes and hollow forms in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders 
our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as a result  we often serve as a technical partner in customizing specialty metals or in developing new ones 
in an effort to increase revenue and profits  we have increased our presence in fast growing international markets 
in recent years  we have expanded our sales and marketing efforts in europe  asia  and north america 
our european headquarters are based in brussels  with our asian sales directed from singapore 
outside the united states  company owned distribution facilities are located in mexico  the united kingdom and belgium 
in addition to the united states  where the majority of our manufacturing exists  we have manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and sweden 
in fiscal years  and  percent million  percent million and percent million  respectively  of our sales were to customers outside of the united states 

table of contents during fiscal year  as part of our overall business strategy to further strengthen and grow our nickel based alloy and titanium businesses  we divested of certain non core businesses which we deemed were not a priority for long term growth and added complexity to our operations 
we have also sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic divestitures  acquisitions  and joint venture propositions 
management has participated in discussions with other companies to explore potential terms and structure of such opportunities 
in addition  management considers opportunities to restructure the organization  its physical locations and geographic presence to optimize efficiencies and align with strategic objectives for the organization 
we expect that we will continue to evaluate these opportunities 
in july  we announced certain changes to our organization which management believes will allow us to better focus on the customer  end use markets and to reach our operational excellence goals 
the announcement included the key appointments of a senior vice president advanced metals operations and a senior vice president premium alloys operations 
as a result of these changes  the company has made changes to the way we report segment information 
business trends and strategic priorities net sales  earnings  free cash flow and pounds sold for the past three fiscal years are summarized below fiscal year in millions  except per share data net sales net sales excluding surcharges income from continuing operations net income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow pounds sold in thousands includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials our results of operations have improved significantly over the past three fiscal years largely as a result of favorable market conditions and our focus on the aerospace and energy markets 
the key components of our strategic priorities are as follows seeking growth opportunities with a market and customer focus  growth in core markets and capitalizing on development of new markets  expansion of sales in markets outside of the us  particularly in china  middle east  india  eastern europe and latin america  achieve operational excellence goals  maintain technology leadership through product development and process improvement  and deliver return to shareholders  
table of contents our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year in millions aerospace industrial energy automotive consumer medical total net sales the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales impact of raw material surcharges and product mix increases in the cost of raw materials have impacted our operations over the past few years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass these cost increases on certain materials through to our customers using surcharges which are structured to recover increases in raw material costs 
in the last several years  as raw material prices have escalated  surcharges have become an increasingly significant component of our net sales  which had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this discussion 
generally  the formula used to calculate the surcharge is based on published prices for the previous month for the respective raw materials  which creates a lag between the raw materials published price change and our corresponding surcharges on sales 
except for the usually modest effect of the lag  the surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales 
we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the time the raw materials are acquired to the time the processed finished goods are sold to the customer 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
conversely in period of decreasing raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 
we produce hundreds of grades of materials  with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade 
in addition  our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make to participate in certain lower margin business in order to utilize available capacity 
while we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time  the impact by period may fluctuate  and period to period comparisons may vary 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
we finished the year with good growth momentum due to strong demand in the global energy and aerospace markets and improving demand in our industrial and consumer businesses 
our international sales have shown continued growth and now represent approximately of our total net sales 
net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which was a percent increase over fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  sales were percent higher than a year earlier 
geographically  sales outside the united states increased percent from a year ago to million 
international sales represented percent of our total net sales for fiscal year compared to percent of total sales for fiscal year sales to europe and asia pacific were particularly strong  increasing percent and percent  respectively  over last year  driven largely by the aerospace and energy end use markets 
sales by end use markets our sales are to customers across diversified end use markets 
the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by principal end use markets fiscal year increase decrease increase decrease in millions aerospace industrial energy automotive consumer medical total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by the same principal end use markets  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year increase decrease increase decrease in millions aerospace industrial energy automotive consumer medical total net sales excluding surcharge revenues 
table of contents sales to the aerospace market increased percent from the same period a year ago to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  sales to the aerospace market increased by percent from the prior year 
the modest growth reflects increases in sales of special alloys used in jet engines and fasteners as well as titanium coil used in fasteners 
these increases were offset by planned inventory adjustments at certain key customers in the first quarter of fiscal year as well as a decline in shipments to a customer who is now procuring some of its aerospace needs internally from its recently acquired subsidiary 
sales to the aerospace end use market showed growth in the second half of fiscal year  consistent with the build schedule for large aircraft 
there was relatively no impact on demand levels as a result of publicized delays of the boeing and airbus a or reductions in the us domestic fleets 
industrial market sales decreased percent during fiscal year to million 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  sales decreased percent 
this decrease reflected lower demand for materials used in the manufacture of valves  fitting and semiconductor sectors  which was partially offset by improved sales of weld wire and basic stainless grades supporting us infrastructure projects 
the sales volumes were also impacted by reduced shipments of lower value materials sold through distributors 
sales to the energy market of million in fiscal year reflected a percent increase as compared with last year 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  sales increased percent from a year ago 
within the energy market  sales to the power generation sector continued to reflect significant increases in demand for our materials used in industrial gas turbines  particularly in europe and the middle east 
in addition  our broad product portfolio of high strength corrosion resistant materials continues to gain strong acceptance among our customers 
the oil and gas sector remains strong  as the number of directional drilling rigs increases throughout the world 
automotive and truck market sales decreased percent from a year ago to million 
excluding surcharge revenues  net sales decreased similarly by percent 
lower automotive production levels and continued economic problems experienced by domestic automakers have contributed to the overall decrease 
this decrease has been partially offset by opportunities we are experiencing from increasing usage of our material in high performing engines and drivetrains 
sales to the consumer market decreased percent to million during fiscal as compared with a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  sales decreased percent 
the overall decrease reflected the impacts of the weakening of the domestic economy as well as reductions in demand for materials used by the housing sector 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in shipments to the sporting goods and electronics sectors 
sales to the medical market of million were percent above a year ago 
excluding surcharge revenues  sales were essentially flat 
notwithstanding the minimal change in fiscal year  medical market sales were negatively impacted in fiscal year by an unfavorable shift in product mix and lower selling prices for titanium products as well as supply chain adjustments experienced in the first half of our fiscal year 
during the second half of fiscal year  purchasing levels in that market appeared to be returning to more normal historical patterns 

table of contents sales by product class the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by major product class fiscal year increase decrease increase decrease in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by the same major product class  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year increase decrease increase decrease in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales of special alloys products increased percent in fiscal year as compared with a year ago to  million 
excluding surcharge revenues  sales increased similarly by percent 
the increase principally reflected the growth that we have experienced in our energy end use market  particularly in europe  asia and the middle east 
our portfolio of special alloy products has fueled strong growth with our customers who require highly engineered specialized materials for demanding applications 
sales of stainless steels remained essentially flat as compared with a year ago 
excluding surcharge revenues  sales decreased by percent 
the decrease resulted from reduced shipments of materials sold through distributors 
sales of titanium products decreased percent as compared with a year ago 
the decrease is primarily a result of reduced shipments of titanium coil used to make fasteners for the aerospace industry that we experienced in the first half of fiscal year in addition  titanium sales during fiscal year were negatively impacted by reductions in overall market prices of titanium 
these reductions appeared to stabilize in the first half of fiscal year  and we began to see an increase in shipments during the second half of fiscal year gross profit gross profit in fiscal year grew to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  a year ago 
the results reflected the increased sales levels  the impacts of changes in inventory levels and year to year raw material costs  and the dilutive effect of surcharge revenue 

table of contents as indicated above  our surcharge mechanism has impacted our gross margin over the last several years 
our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs  although generally with a one month lag effect 
while the surcharge mechanism attempts to protect absolute gross profit dollars  it does have a dilutive effect on gross margins 
the following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharges on gross margin for fiscal year and in millions fiscal year net sales less surcharge revenues net sales excluding surcharges gross profit gross margin gross margin excluding dilutive effect of surcharges we estimate that the lag effect of the surcharge mechanism  which results from calculating the surcharge amount for each month using the previous month s raw material prices  positively impacted gross margin by basis points during fiscal year and negatively impacted gross margin by basis points during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales  in fiscal year the increase is primarily attributable to investments in systems and resources needed to drive our future growth initiatives as well as the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to the boarhead farms matter discussed later below 
fiscal year included million related to executive transition costs and million associated with the review of a possible acquisition 
interest expense fiscal year interest expense of million decreased percent from million in fiscal interest on substantially all of our debt was at a fixed rate 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the reductions in outstanding debt related to current year repayments  as well as a million increase in the amount of interest capitalized associated with ongoing construction projects during fiscal year as compared with fiscal year other income  net other income for fiscal year was million as compared with million a year ago 
the decrease principally reflected lower invested cash balances 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes for fiscal year was percent as compared to percent last year 
the fiscal year tax rate was more favorable than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of million  or percent of pretax income  reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances that had been recorded against state net operating loss carryforwards in prior years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 valuation allowances should be reviewed each year and an assessment must be made as to the likelihood of recovery of those deferred taxes 
based on current year and forecasted taxable income in certain jurisdictions  we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a portion of this valuation allowance in fiscal year we recognized a benefit of million  or percent of pretax income  in connection with the domestic manufacturing deduction  which was part of the american jobs creation act of allowing a special deduction for qualified manufacturing activities 
the act also provided for a two year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion deduction 
as a result  we recognized an increase in income tax expense year over year  reflecting the phase out of the deduction in  and the repeal in the fiscal year tax rate was more favorable than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of million  or percent of pretax income  reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances that had been recorded against state net operating loss carryforwards in prior years 
based on current year and forecasted taxable income in certain jurisdictions  we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a portion of this valuation allowance in fiscal year we recognized a benefit of million  or percent  due to a favorable state tax settlement 
we recognized a benefit of million  or percent of pretax income  in connection with the domestic manufacturing deduction of the american jobs creation act of see note to the consolidated financial statements in
