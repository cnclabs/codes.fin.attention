item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations and financial condition overview we are a global market leader in design  development  manufacture  sale and support of commercial jetliners  military aircraft  satellites  missile defense  human space flight and launch systems and services 
we are one of the two major manufacturers of seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the us while our principal operations are in the us  we rely extensively on a network of partners  key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world 
our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses commercial airplanes and integrated defense systems ids supplemented and supported by boeing capital corporation bcc 
taken together  these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace 
we focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality 
ids integrates its resources in defense  intelligence  communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs 
our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets  underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity 
our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality 
bcc delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure 
in  our revenues grew by 
earnings from operations increased 
we continued to invest in key growth programs as research and development expense grew by to billion  reflecting increased spending on the and programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers 
we generated operating cash flow of billion driven by operating and working capital performance 
we reduced debt by billion and repurchased million common shares 
our contractual backlog grew to billion  driven by growth at commercial airplanes while our total backlog grew to billion 
we expect continued growth in commercial airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production 
we expect ids revenue to remain relatively flat in compared with and anticipate that the us department of defense us dod budget growth will begin to moderate over the next several years 
we are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth 
consolidated results of operations revenues dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other accounting differences eliminations revenues 
table of contents revenues in grew by  million  primarily due to the growth at commercial airplanes 
commercial airplanes revenues increased by  million  primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities 
ids revenues decreased by million  primarily due to lower revenues in network and space systems n ss resulting from the formation of the united launch alliance ula joint venture in and lower revenues in precision engagement and mobility systems pe ms  offset by growth in support systems 
bcc revenues decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio 
accounting differences eliminations changed by million primarily due to fewer commercial airplanes intercompany deliveries when compared with higher consolidated revenues in were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries 
ids revenues were up moderately in as growth in pe ms and support systems was partially offset by lower volume in n ss 
bcc revenues increased in primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets 
other segment revenues decreased in as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of million in accounting differences eliminations decreased revenues due to higher commercial airplanes intercompany deliveries in earnings from operations the following table summarizes our earnings from operations dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other unallocated expense settlement with us department of justice  net of accruals earnings from operations operating earnings in improved by  million compared with the increase is partly due to the million global settlement with us department of justice us doj that occurred in the second quarter of commercial airplanes earnings increased by million compared with the same period in  primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries  commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense 
commercial airplanes research and development expense increased by million to  million compared with the same period  primarily due to spending on the and programs 
ids earnings increased by million compared with the increase is primarily due to charges of million in the pe ms segment related to airborne early warning control aew c  partially offset by lower earnings on several programs in the pe ms and n ss segments 
bcc operating earnings decreased million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses 
other segment earnings improved by million primarily due to the absence of losses related to connexion by boeing  which included a charge of million to exit this business in lower unallocated expense in contributed million to the earnings improvement 
operating earnings increased in compared with primarily driven by improved earnings at commercial airplanes resulting from higher revenue from new aircraft deliveries  increased earnings from commercial aviation support business and improved cost performance 
lower unallocated expense in also contributed to the earnings increase 
this was partially offset by a million charge for 
table of contents global settlement with us doj  lower ids earnings reflecting a million net gain on the sale of our rocketdyne business in and million of charges on the aew c development program in partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a million charge related to the exit of the connexion by boeing business recorded in other segment 
the most significant items included in unallocated expense are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  pension and other postretirement share based plans deferred compensation other unallocated expense we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
accordingly  earnings from operations included  million   million and  million in   and  respectively 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
pension and other postretirement expense increased during when compared with primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of december   which are subsequently expensed in cost of sales in pension and other postretirement expense decreased in compared with mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized 
the reduction in share based plans expense is primarily due to lower performance shares outstanding during and higher expense acceleration during  resulting from payouts compared with six payouts in the decrease in share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price during which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock 
the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price 
other expense decreased in partly due to reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries during compared with 
table of contents other earnings items dollars in millions years ended december  earnings from operations other income  net interest and debt expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations other income  which primarily consists of interest income  was higher in compared with as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return on cash and investments 
other income was higher in compared with as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return  partially offset by lower interest income compared with related to federal income tax settlements for prior years 
interest and debt expense decreased in and in  primarily due to debt repayments 
the effective income tax rate of for differed from the effective income tax rate of primarily due to foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits that existed in  but did not recur in this was partially offset by the non deduction in of the global settlement with the us doj and other income tax provision adjustments 
the tax rate of included enhanced research and development credits that exceeded the credits in the effective income tax rate of for differed from the effective income tax rate of primarily due to the favorable settlement with the internal revenue service and the non deduction in of the global settlement with the us doj

unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog 
the decrease in ids unobligated backlog of  million during compared with is primarily due to funding released from existing contracts on future combat systems fcs  proprietary  c  p a and f  partially offset by increases in the f program and support systems 

table of contents segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment the fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
air traffic growth continues to exceed its long term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers 
global economic growth  the primary driver of air traffic growth  remained above long term trend for the fourth straight year in the world economy has grown at an average annual rate since compared to the long term trend rate of 
the increasingly diversified world economy is forecast to continue above trend growth through the end of the decade although there is increased uncertainty in the near term outlook due to a slowdown in the united states economy 
increasingly liberalized and competitive air travel markets are also supporting strong traffic growth 
many bilateral air service agreements governing air traffic rights between countries are liberalizing air travel around the world particularly in high growth markets such as china and india which have signed multiple new agreements over the last several years 
in addition  open skies agreements  in which all traffic rights restrictions are eliminated  continue to emerge with united states european union open skies negotiations being the most prominent recent example 
airline ownership is also becoming more commercially driven governments are reducing ownership and control stakes  moving away from national carriers 
all of these facets of liberalization are increasing competition between airlines and further stimulating demand for air travel 
in this increasingly liberalized environment  airlines are offering improved service levels increasing flight frequency and airport pairs served by per year since the combination of these two fundamental drivers has led to a annual average increase in the number of passengers since in addition  high fuel prices are spurring strong demand to replace older  less fuel efficient airplanes 
together  these two factors have led to strong demand for new aircraft over  orders for large commercial jet aircraft over the last four years  increasing industry backlog levels to seven years of deliveries at current production rates 
fuel prices are also playing a key role in increasing the current demand for new aircraft 
strong economic growth has also led to sustained high oil and fuel prices 
between and  jet fuel expense grew from percent to more than percent of airline operating costs 
airlines are responding by improving the fuel efficiency of their aircraft operations and reducing cost in many other areas 
they are implementing more efficient internet based distribution systems  reducing commission payments  and drawing on their employees for participation in labor cost reduction 
these initiatives  combined with strong demand  are enabling industry wide profitability despite high fuel prices 
worldwide airlines achieved a billion net profit in and are forecast to earn billion in looking forward  our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger traffic  and per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks such as avian flu  terrorism  global economic cycles  increased global environmental regulations and fuel prices 
fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and historically low surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks 

table of contents industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately two thirds of commercial airplanes sales and contractual backlog are directly from customers based outside the united states 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china  and japan are likely to enter the to seat aircraft market over the next few years 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
a decline of the us dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits 
competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two year reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity by if the us dollar strengthens  airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog revenues the increase in revenue of  million in from was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries  including model mix changes  of  million  increased commercial aviation support business of  million and million primarily attributable to revenue from aircraft trading 

table of contents the increase in revenue of  million in from was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries  including model mix changes  of  million  increased commercial aviation support business of million offset by million primarily attributable to lower revenue from aircraft trading

in addition cost performance improved by million 
these were offset by an increase in research and development costs of million 
the  million increase in earnings from operations in over the comparable period of was primarily attributable to earnings of  million on increased new aircraft deliveries and million in increased earnings primarily attributable to commercial aviation support business 
in addition cost performance improved by million 
such items were offset by increased research and development costs of  million 
in we had a loss on the sale of wichita  kansas and tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma operations of million 
the iam strike resulted in lower operating earnings in due to fewer than expected airplane deliveries 
backlog the backlog increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs  while the increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for ng  and accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
its determination is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts 
it is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 

table of contents commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which do not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates  thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 
the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the table below provides details as of december program ng program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a the accounting quantity for the program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery  targeted for firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired 
typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its board of directors  shareholders  government and completing financing arrangements 
all such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain 
firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights 
cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
next generation the accounting quantity for the next generation program increased by units during due to the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during in the fourth quarter of we completed firm configuration of the intercontinental airplane and during we completed firm configuration of the freighter 
while there are always risks to development  production and certification schedules in the introduction of a new commercial derivative airplane  deliveries of the first freighter and intercontinental airplane are targeted for late and late 
table of contents program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during as a result of the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
firm configuration of the freighter was completed during deliveries of the first freighter are targeted for late program we are in the very critical stages of final assembly and planning for flight test  and the risks that are always inherent in these latter stages of airplane production still remain 
we continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first airplanes  including start up issues in our factory  management of our extended global supply chain  completion and integration of traveled work and reconciliation of the airplane s configuration with supplier and partner engineering 
in january we announced that first flight of the has been moved from the end of the first quarter of to around the end of the second quarter of to provide additional time to complete assembly of the first airplane 
deliveries are now expected to begin in early  rather than late we continue working with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of the schedule change on the flight test program and entry into service 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as commercial aviation support  these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
logo our research and development expense increased million and  million in and research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers 
the increase in was due to higher spending of million  primarily on and  and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
we anticipate a decrease in research and development spending for primarily due to reduced product development activities 

table of contents integrated defense systems business environment and trends ids consists of three capabilities driven businesses precision engagement and mobility systems pe ms  network and space systems n ss  and support systems 
defense environment overview the us is faced with continuous force deployments overseas  stability operations in afghanistan and iraq  and uncertainties about near peer adversary states with growing sophistication and military means 
at the same time  our defense department faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest quadrennial defense review qdr 
all of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant federal budget deficits and bipartisan objectives to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending as well as the upcoming presidential elections 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade 
because us dod spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately of ids revenue in  the trends and drivers associated with the us dod budget are critical 
the us dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  particularly after the terrorist attacks of september  although the growth rate had moderated in recent years  the submittal equates to a increase over the president s request for fiscal year is billion  excluding the additional initial request of billion to continue the fight in the global war on terror gwot 
the procurement account continues to see growth with a request of billion  a increase over  while the research  development  test evaluation account increased modestly to billion  a increase from the level 
all projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for supplemental funding 
over the past years  emergency supplemental requests have been used to cover the on going costs of the gwot 
in addition to the fiscal year discretionary budget request  the president also submitted supplemental requests totaling billion to cover operations in the gwot 
it is anticipated that additional supplemental requests for will exceed billion  including the billion initially requested  and that the trend to use supplemental requests to fund the gwot will continue 
even though we continue to see modest growth in the us dod budget  it is unlikely that the us dod will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the latest qdr 
this imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the us dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs 
we expect the us dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness and network enabled operations 
these strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons as well as continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
consolidation of contractor provided us government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the ula joint venture in this consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market 
launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market  but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re evaluated 
the us government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use 
the ula joint venture is intended to provide this assurance 

table of contents civil space transportation and exploration environment nasa has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade 
nasa s fiscal year appropriation of billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year funding level 
nasa s budget remains focused on needed funds for space shuttle operations  international space station  and new initiatives associated with the vision for space exploration 
we anticipate funding levels to remain in the billion range in the near future 
nasa is continuing to pursue elements of the vision for space exploration  which will provide additional opportunities 
commercial satellite environment the commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade 
the market remains extremely competitive with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing 
we will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions 
integrated defense systems operating results ids realignment effective january   the b bomber program formerly included in pe ms and certain boeing australia limited programs formerly included in n ss are included in support systems 
business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment 
see note operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues ids revenues decreased in primarily due the exclusion of the government delta volume from n ss revenues  now a revenue component for our joint venture ula 
decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the pe ms segment were partially offset by increased volume in other n ss programs and growth in the support systems segment 
ids revenues increased in as growth in pe ms and support systems was partially offset by lower volume in n ss 
operating earnings ids operating earnings increased by million in compared with primarily due to million of charges on the aew c development program in the increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the pe ms and n ss segments 
operating earnings 
table of contents decreased by million in compared with reflecting a million net gain on the sale of rocketdyne in and million of charges on the aew c development program in partially offset by improved margins on other programs 
backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
ids total backlog decreased in  from  million to  million  primarily due to current year deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in fcs  c  and p a programs 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include airborne laser  e a g  family of beyond line of sight terminals jtrs  fcs  ground based midcourse defense gmd  joint tactical radio system  p a and proprietary programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed  which could trigger termination for default provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of these programs include aew c  international kc tanker  commercial and military satellites  sbinet  vigilare and high frequency modernisation 
precision engagement and mobility systems operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog revenues pe ms revenues decreased in compared with an increase of in the decrease of million in was due to reduced deliveries of the apache and t aircraft and joint direct attack munitions  partially offset by higher deliveries of chinook and f aircraft and higher volume on the p a program 
the revenue growth of million in was driven by higher deliveries of f and apache aircraft and higher volume on p a  f  and chinook  partially offset by reduced revenues on aew c 

table of contents deliveries of new build production aircraft  excluding remanufactures and modifications  were as follows f a models t ts goshawk f e eagle c globemaster ch chinook ah apache c a clipper total new build production aircraft operating earnings pe ms operating earnings increased by million in primarily due to the charges of million on the aew c development program  which were partially offset by lower earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international kc tanker program  lower prices on the c program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the aew c program 
operating earnings decreased by million in due to the above mentioned aew c charge  which was partially offset by earnings from revenue growth  favorable contract mix  and reduced company sponsored research development expenditures on the tanker program 
research and development the pe ms segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge  technical strength and large scale integration capabilities to provide innovative solutions to meet the war fighter s enduring needs 
research and development has remained consistent over the past several years 
research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility  precision effects  situational awareness and survivability 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability  and improving affordability  reliability and economic ownership 
continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles 
research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes  among other things  precision guidance and multi mode targeting 
research and development investments in the global tanker aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and non us customers 
investments were also made to support various intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance business opportunities including p a and aew c aircraft 
other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the f a e f super hornet  f e eagle  ah apache  ch chinook and c globemaster 
backlog pe ms total backlog decreased by in compared with primarily due to deliveries and sales on c  f a  p a and f these decreases were partially offset by a multi year contract for f aircraft and international orders for aew c and f a aircraft 
total backlog decreased by in compared with primarily due to deliveries and sales on f a and f from multi year contracts awarded in prior years 

table of contents additional considerations items which could have a future impact on pe ms operations include the following aew c during we recorded charges of million on our international airborne early warning control program 
this development program  also known as wedgetail in australia and peace eagle in turkey  consists of a aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which have never been installed on an airplane before 
wedgetail includes six aircraft and peace eagle includes four aircraft 
this is an advanced and complex fixed price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
we believe that the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed 
international kc tanker program during  the pe ms segment recorded charges of million which were partially offset at the consolidated level 
currently the international kc tanker program includes four aircraft for the italian air force and four aircraft for the japanese air self defense force 
these charges are associated with additional estimated costs for mitigating both the risks on the flight test program and the delivery risk associated with the italy and japan contracts 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed 
c as of december  we delivered of the c aircraft ordered by the us air force  with final deliveries scheduled for in june  based upon continued bipartisan congressional support  including the house armed services committee addition of billion for c s in their mark of the budget  and us air force testimony to congress reflecting interest in additional c aircraft  we directed key suppliers to begin work on aircraft beyond the currently on order 
as of december   inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers for work performed related to anticipated orders for c aircraft to the us air force and anticipated international orders for additional aircraft totaled approximately million 
it is reasonably possible that we will decide in to complete production of the c if further orders are not received 
we are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut down  including any recovery that would be available from the government 
such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from the second quarter direction to key suppliers to begin working on the additional aircraft

table of contents revenues n ss revenues decreased in both and the decrease of million in was primarily due to the exclusion of government delta volume  now a component of our equity investment in ula and lower fcs volume  partially offset by increased volume on sbinet and several satellite programs 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to lower volume in proprietary and gmd as well as the divestiture of our rocketdyne business  which were partly offset by significant growth in fcs and higher delta iv volume 
additional impacts resulted from fewer milestone completions in our commercial satellite business in and the completion of a homeland security contract in delta launch and new build satellite deliveries were as follows delta ii commercial delta ii government delta iv government satellites delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after december  due to the formation of ula 
operating earnings n ss operating earnings decreased by million in and decreased by million in the decrease in was due to lower earnings on fcs and several satellite programs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on gmd and a million gain on sale of anaheim property 
the decrease in was primarily due to the million net gain on the rocketdyne sale and higher contract values for delta iv launch contracts in  partially offset by increased earnings in the fcs program in n ss operating earnings include equity earnings of million  million and million from the united space alliance joint venture in   and  respectively and equity loss of million and equity earnings of million from the ula joint venture in and the ula equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization

key programs in this area include joint tactical radio system  fcs  global positioning system  and transformational satellite communications system 
investments were also made to support concepts that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems 
along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network enabled capabilities development  we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies 
backlog n ss total backlog decreased by in compared with due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on fcs and proprietary programs  partially offset by an increase in our space exploration programs 
total backlog decreased by in compared with primarily due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on the fcs program 

table of contents additional considerations items which could have a future impact on n ss operations include the following united launch alliance on december   we completed the transaction with lockheed martin corporation lockheed to create a joint venture named united launch alliance llc ula 
ula combines the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of boeing delta and lockheed atlas rockets 
in connection with the transaction  we initially contributed net assets of million at december  on july  we and lockheed reached agreement with respect to resolution of the final working capital and the value of the launch vehicle support contracts that each party contributed to form ula 
effective august  the parties received all necessary approvals pursuant to the terms of the consent order and the terms of the agreement which resulted in additional contributions from both parties with boeing agreeing to contribute an additional million which did not result in a cash outflow as it will be offset against future payments due to us from ula associated with an inventory supply agreement 
additionally  conformed accounting adjustments made by ula resulted in adjustments to ula s balance sheet 
the book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ula s net assets 
this difference will be expensed ratably in future years 
based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ula  this amortization is expected to be approximately million annually for the next years 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and lockheed each committed to provide up to million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ula of up to million to support its working capital requirements 
we and lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain us government contracts to ula as of the closing date 
we and lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the us government 
in december  we agreed to indemnify ula through december  against potential non recoverability of  million of boeing delta inventories included in contributed assets plus  million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement which ends on march  since inception  ula sold million of inventories that were contributed by us 
during  ula determined that certain delta ii inventory is not fully recoverable 
as a result we recorded charges of million for non recoverable delta ii inventory and million for our share of the loss recorded by ula related to delta ii 
future decisions regarding the delta ii program could reduce our earnings by up to million 
we also agreed to indemnify ula in the event ula is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ula and to which we believe ula is entitled 
we will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to million in pre tax losses related to these contracts 
sea launch the sea launch venture  in which we are a partner  provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers 

table of contents we have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the sea launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing 
in the event we are required to perform on these guarantees  we believe we can recover a portion of the cost estimated at million through guarantees from the other venture partners 
the components of this exposure are as follows dollars in millions estimated maximum exposure established reserves estimated proceeds from recourse estimated net exposure credit guarantees partner loans principal and interest trade receivable from sea launch performance guarantees subcontract termination other receivables and inventory we made no additional capital contributions to the sea launch venture during the year ended december  the venture conducted zero  five and four successful launches for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a sea launch zenit sl vehicle  carrying a boeing built nss satellite  experienced an anomaly during launch on january  the launch platform has been repaired and resumed flight operations on january   successfully launching a boeing built satellite 
the venture incurred losses in due to a delay in its launch manifest that was caused by the launch anomaly and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during november and december 
the venture incurred losses in and due to the relatively low price and volume of launches  driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements 
we suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to sea launch down to zero in and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on sea launch indebtedness 
we are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the sea launch venture 
however  in the event that we do extend additional financial support to sea launch in the future  we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate 
in addition  we continue to look at alternative capital structures for the venture 
satellites the boeing built nss satellite was declared a total loss due to an anomaly during launch on january  the nss satellite was insured for million which was collected during the second and third quarter of new skies satellites bv new skies declined to exercise its option to purchase a replacement spacecraft due to its assertion that we anticipatorily breached the contract 
we believe that had new skies exercised its option  we would have fulfilled our contractual responsibilities 
we do not expect new skies assertion to materially impact our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows

table of contents support systems operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog revenues support systems revenues increased million in and million in  an increase of and 
the increases were due to higher integrated logistics il program volume resulting from the acquisition of aviall  inc aviall and increased revenue on the c support program 
higher international program volume in was the result of our increased ownership in alsalam aircraft company alsalam which occurred during the second quarter of lower volume on several maintenance  modification and upgrades mm u and training systems and services ts s programs partially offset the increases 
higher volume on several mm u programs also contributed to the significant growth in revenues 
in the second quarter of we increased our ownership interest in alsalam  which operates as a maintenance  repair and overhaul facility for various military and commercial aircraft 
as a result  we began consolidating alsalam s financial statements  which generated revenues of million during and million during the last three quarters of operating earnings support systems operating earnings increased by in and increased by in driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix

boeing capital corporation segment business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million  which was substantially collateralized by boeing produced commercial aircraft 
while worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past  the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry 
at the same time  the credit ratings of some airlines  particularly in the united states  have remained at low levels 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among us commercial airline customers 

table of contents certain aircraft models in bcc s portfolio have recently experienced a lower rate of decline in market value and some models have experienced increases in market value 
this market value condition had been due to certain positive factors including passenger load at record high levels  a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft  increasing lease rates  and increased demand from used aircraft buyers 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service 
approximately  commercial jet aircraft of current world fleet continue to be parked  including both in production and out of production aircraft types  of which over are not expected to return to service 
aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft  particularly types with relatively few operators  are placed out of service 
summary financial information dollars in millions years ended december  revenues earnings from operations operating margins revenues bcc segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes 
bcc s revenues decreased million in  resulting from lower interest income on notes receivable of million  lower investment income of million primarily due to the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments in and lower net gain on disposal of assets of million 
bcc s revenues increased million in  primarily due to an increase of investment income and higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable 
operating earnings bcc s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense  provision for recovery of losses  asset impairment expense  depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses 
operating earnings decreased by million in primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest expense  lower asset impairment expense and lower depreciation expense and a recovery of losses 
the increase in operating earnings in compared with was primarily due to higher revenues 
financial position the following table presents selected financial data for bcc dollars in millions bcc customer financing and investment portfolio valuation allowance as a of total receivables debt debt to equity ratio to to bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  decreased from december  due to prepayment of certain notes receivable  normal portfolio run off and sale of certain portfolio assets

finance restructurings from time to time  certain bcc customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with bcc 
as of december   bcc has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings  cash flows and or financial position 
other segment other segment operating losses were million during as compared to losses of million in the reduction of million was primarily due to the absence of losses related to connexion by boeing  which we exited in as part of our exit from this business  we recognized a charge of million in  in addition to losses of million for the year ended december  we have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers 
we do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows and or financial position 
other segment operating losses were million during as compared to losses of million in the increase of million was primarily due to the million charge from the exit of the connexion by boeing business and the million environmental expense recognized in the other segment recorded million of lower valuation allowances for customer financing in compared to additionally  during  the other segment recognized earnings of million associated with the buyout of several operating lease aircraft by a customer

in addition  working capital improved in  reflecting higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run off  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp up of the program 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to  million in the increase was primarily due to working capital improvements which were partially offset by lower net earnings 
the working capital improvements in compared with reflect  million of lower pension contributions in working capital reductions in also reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders  decreased investment in customer financing  and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liability 
investing activities cash used for investing activities increased to  million in from  million in  largely due to increases in short term investments  primarily time deposits and commercial paper  partially offset by our investment in the acquisition of aviall in at december  the recorded balances of time deposits and commercial paper classified as short term investments were  million and million

the balance  at december  and  was  million and  million  of which million and million was classified as short term 
the investments are held as available for sale 
cash used for investing activities increased to  million in from million in the increase is primarily due to our investment of  million in the acquisition of aviall  net of million of cash acquired  and million of assumed debt  in an all cash merger 
the assumed debt was repaid on the acquisition closing date

the ratings were reaffirmed at a for long term borrowings and f for short term borrowings 
on january   fitch ratings changed their outlook on the a rating to stable from positive  citing the impact of delays in the program 
capital resources we and bcc have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity 
throughout and at december   neither we nor bcc had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
we believe we have substantial borrowing capacity 
currently  we have  million  million exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements 
in  we renewed the day revolving credit facility and the year credit facility  of which million and  million is allocated to bcc 
bcc has an aggregate of  million available for issuance from shelf registrations filed with the sec  which are due to expire in november we believe our internally generated liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
we and lockheed have agreed to make available to ula a line of credit in the amount of up to million each as may be necessary from time to time to support ula s expendable launch vehicle business during the five year period following december  ula did not request any funds under the line of credit as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas  we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  with a corresponding after tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss

table of contents disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   and the estimated timing thereof 
contractual obligations dollars in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt including current portion interest on debt pension and other post retirement cash requirements capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position total contractual obligations includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at december  variable rate debt was approximately of our total debt at december  income tax obligations as of december   our total liability for income taxes payable  including uncertain tax positions  was  million  of which million we expect to pay in the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining  million 
our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements  pursuant to erisa regulations  although we may make additional discretionary contributions 
estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
in addition  the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement 
table of contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a country outside the us or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable 
commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of december  dollars in millions total amounts committed maximum amount of loss less than year years years after years standby letters of credit and surety bonds aircraft financing commercial commitments total commercial commitments aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order  under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates 
based on historical experience  we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers  see note industrial revenue bonds we utilize industrial revenue bonds irb issued by the city of wichita  kansas and fulton county  georgia to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property  see note 
table of contents contingent obligations we have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business  which include the following legal various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against us 
most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance 
legal contingencies are discussed in note  including our contesting the default termination of the a aircraft  employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees  and litigation arbitration involving bssi programs 
environmental remediation we are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of million at december  for additional information  see note income taxes we have recorded a net liability of  million at december  for uncertain tax positions 
for further discussion of these contingencies  see note off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note critical accounting policies contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future 
table of contents periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in ids for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured parts  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
aircraft valuation impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease we evaluate assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset is less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intentions for how long we will 
table of contents hold an asset subject to operating lease before we sell the asset  the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplanes segment are included in inventory at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets 
to mitigate costs and enhance marketability  aircraft may be placed on operating lease 
while on operating lease  the assets are included in customer financing  however  the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market 
allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
two of the major factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings and collateral values 
if each customer s credit rating were increased or decreased by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were lower at december   the allowance would have increased by million 
lease residual values equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   this would result in a future cumulative pre tax earnings impact of million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which million would be recognized in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 

table of contents the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded 
at the date of our previous impairment test  a increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements 
indefinite lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
postretirement plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees 
we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense 
in addition  as result of our adoption of sfas  differences between actual and expected returns on assets  changes in assumptions  and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease shareholders equity net of taxes at future measurement dates 
we use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our september annual measurement date 
changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity as of the measurement date 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate 
as of september  in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans dollars dollars projected benefit obligation pensions net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased pension income by approximately million 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in shareholders equity net of taxes as of our annual measurement date 

table of contents the assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year s expense recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally investments  fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the principal source of bcc s market risk relates to interest rate changes 
this risk is managed by matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with the profile of bcc s assets 
exposure to mismatched risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives 
we do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
although many of the assets  liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded  if we had an immediate  one time  basis point increase in market rates at december   we estimate that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by million compared to a decrease of million at december  based on the portfolio of other boeing existing debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
