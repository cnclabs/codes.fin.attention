risk factors 
industry risk factors limited availability of financing for manufactured homes on leased land and higher costs of this financing could continue to limit the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
frequently  manufactured homes are purchased  and the land on which they are placed is leased 
loans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes without land  also known as chattel loans  usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates  and may be more difficult to obtain than mortgages for manufactured or site built homes that are on owned land 
lenders have been requiring high credit scores and other criteria for these loans  and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify 
the availability  cost  and terms of these chattel loans are also dependent on economic conditions  lending practices of financial institutions  governmental policies  and other factors that are beyond our control 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
the recent subprime mortgage crisis could further limit the ability of consumers to obtain financing for manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
the subprime mortgage crisis has resulted in significant changes in the lending practices of financial institutions  and some lenders have reduced loan availability 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and rvs as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis could limit the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing may prevent retailers from carrying an adequate inventory of rvs or manufactured homes  which could reduce demand for our products 
retailers of rvs and manufactured homes generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions  often called floor plan financing 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing may prevent retailers from carrying an adequate inventory of rvs or manufactured homes  which could reduce demand for our products 
high levels of repossessions of manufactured homes could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
during the s  lower credit standards by lenders and prevailing economic conditions caused an increase in the number of manufactured homes subsequently repossessed by lenders 
repossessed homes are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices  which reduces the demand for new manufactured homes 
similar conditions in the future could cause high levels of repossessions which could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
changes in zoning regulations for manufactured homes could lead to reduced demand for our products 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning regulations 
in the past  there has been resistance by local property owners and zoning officials to zoning ordinances allowing the location of manufactured homes in certain areas comprised of conventional residences 
continued resistance to these zoning ordinances could have an adverse impact on sales of manufactured homes  which could reduce demand for our products 
gasoline shortages  or high prices for gasoline  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
high prices for gasoline  fuel shortages  or anticipation of potential fuel shortages  could adversely affect consumer demand for rvs  which could reduce demand for our products 
excess inventories by retailers and manufacturers could cause a decline in the demand for our products 
retailers and manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes may carry excess inventory  as they periodically have in the past 
sales of excess inventory may cause the manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes to reduce production of new vehicles and homes  which could cause a decline in demand for our products 
the manufactured housing industry has been experiencing a significant decline in shipments 
our mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  operates in an industry which has been experiencing a decline in production of new homes since the downturn has been caused in part by limited availability of financing for manufactured homes 
further  for the last several years  many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase conventional homes because subprime mortgages were available at unrealistic terms 
moreover  because of the current weak market for conventional housing  retirees may not be able to sell their primary residence  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase a less expensive manufactured home 
if these conditions persist  it is not likely that the manufactured housing industry will improve in the short term  and certain of our customers could experience financial difficulties 
these factors could result in reduced demand for products from our mh segment  as well as difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
business cycles may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
both the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are impacted by business cycles and this may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
business cycles may depend upon general economic conditions  interest rates  consumer confidence  demographic changes  and other factors beyond our control 
economic conditions and consumer confidence may affect our operating results 
national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence may affect the retail sale of recreational vehicles and manufactured homes adverse weather conditions could reduce demand for our products 
adverse weather conditions could temporarily interfere with the ability of our manufactured housing customers to transport manufactured homes to dealers via roadway  which could impact retail sales of manufactured homes 
this could temporarily cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products during certain months 
company specific risk factors increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
the prices the company pays for steel  which represents about percent of the company s raw material costs  and other key raw materials  have been volatile and have increased significantly since the beginning of in addition  the company has received notice of cost increases of percent or more from its suppliers of certain key raw materials which are scheduled to go into effect during the first quarter of the impact of higher raw materials costs historically has been substantially offset by surcharges and sales price increases to our customers  but there can be no assurance that such surcharges and price increases can be continued 
because competition may limit the amount of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to customers in the form of price increases  increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
inadequate supply of imported raw materials used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
we import approximately percent of raw materials and components that we use in manufacturing our products 
if these imported raw materials or components become unavailable  or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected 
increases in labor rates or reduced availability of labor could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
certain geographic regions in which we have manufacturing facilities have very low unemployment rates 
this and other factors could result in shortages of qualified employees and increased labor costs 
because competition may limit the amount of labor increases that can be passed through to customers in the form of price increases  increased labor costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
we are involved in certain litigation  which if decided adversely to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
the litigation is described in this report in item legal proceedings 
the loss of any customer accounting for more than percent of our consolidated sales could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
one customer of the rv segment accounted for percent  and another customer of both the rv segment and the mh segment accounted for percent  of the company s consolidated net sales in the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  however  because we sell a variety of products to these customers in several geographic regions  we believe it is unlikely that we would lose the entire business of either of these customers 
competitive pressures could reduce demand for our products 
domestic and foreign competitors may lower prices or develop product improvements which could reduce demand for our products 
the financial condition of several of our significant customers could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
financial difficulties of our significant customers could result in reduced demand for our products  as well as losses due to the inability to collect accounts receivable

case no 
as 
each case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all others similarly situated 
the complaints in both cases are substantially identical and the cases were consolidated 
defendant zieman manufacturing company zieman is a subsidiary of lippert 
mandatory mediation was conducted 
the parties reached a settlement  and entered into a final settlement agreement 
the settlement does not result in material liability to zieman 
on february   the court signed a judgment approving the settlement  subject to appeal within days 
although the company does not anticipate any appeals  there can be no assurance that an appeal will not be asserted 
plaintiffs alleged that defendant weekend warrior sold certain toy hauler trailers during the model years equipped with frames manufactured by zieman that were defective in design and manufacture  causing damage to the trailers and the towing vehicles 
plaintiffs sought monetary damages in an unspecified amount including compensatory  incidental and consequential damages  punitive damages  restitution  declaratory and injunctive relief  attorney s fees and costs 
zieman vigorously defended against the allegations made by plaintiffs  as well as plaintiffs ability to pursue the claims as a class action 
zieman and lippert s liability insurers agreed to defend zieman  subject to reservation of the insurers rights 
on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  inc  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to fire spread control established by the united states department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act sec 
et seq  and the california song beverly consumer warranty act sec 
et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiffs attorneys fees 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
although discovery by plaintiff is continuing  at this point  based on the foregoing investigation and testing  kinro believes that plaintiff may not be able to prove the essential elements of her claim  and defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
in this connection  defendants have filed initial motions seeking summary judgment against plaintiff s case to be supplemented and refiled  seeking sanctions against plaintiff and her attorneys for destroying the bathtub which is the subject of this litigation  and challenging the propriety of a class action 
moreover  kinro believes that  because test results received by kinro confirm that it is in compliance with hud safety standards  no remedial action is required or appropriate 
in october  the parties participated in voluntary non binding mediation in an effort to reach a settlement 
kinro made an offer of settlement consistent with its belief regarding the merits of plaintiff s allegations 
although no settlement was reached  the parties have since had intermittent discussions 
the outcome of such settlement efforts cannot be predicted 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzales as the class representative 
the court ruled that plaintiff may not be an appropriate class representative for injunctive relief because her bathtub had been replaced 
the court granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add a different plaintiff 
the court also denied  without prejudice  kinro s motion for sanctions based on spoliation of evidence because testing the bathtub of the new plaintiff may affect the ruling on the motion 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations  and intends to continue its vigorous defense against both plaintiffs claims 
if settlement is not reached and plaintiffs pursue their claims  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
in connection with a tax audit by the indiana department of revenue pertaining to calendar years to  the company received an initial examination report asserting  in the aggregate  approximately million of proposed tax adjustments  including interest and penalties 
after two hearings with the indiana department of revenue  the audit findings were upheld 
the company believes that it has properly reported its income and paid taxes in indiana in accordance with applicable laws  and filed an appeal in december with the indiana tax court 
the matter has been scheduled for trial in september in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company has two reportable segments  the recreational vehicle rv products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment 
the company s operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert 
each has operations in both the rv and mh segments 
at december   the company s subsidiaries operated plants in the united states 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of recreational vehicles  including windows  doors  steel chassis  steel chassis parts  slide out mechanisms and related power units  and electric stabilizer jacks 
during the last few years  the company has also introduced leveling devices  axles  steps  bed lifts  suspension systems  ramp doors  exterior panels and thermoformed bath and kitchen products for rvs 
more than percent of the company s rv segment sales are of products used in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
the balance represents sales of components for motorhomes  and sales of specialty trailers for hauling boats  personal watercraft  snowmobiles and equipment  as well as axles for specialty trailers 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in  up from percent in the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes  and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  steel chassis  steel chassis parts  axles  and thermoformed bath and kitchen products 
other than sales of specialty trailers and related axles  which aggregated million and million in and  respectively  sales of products other than components for rvs and manufactured homes are not considered significant 
however  certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational  camping  travel or seasonal use 
rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers  fifth wheel travel trailers  folding camping trailers and truck campers 
towable rvs represented approximately percent of the  rvs produced in  while motorhomes represented the remaining percent of rvs produced 
motorhomes have a significantly higher average retail selling price than towable rvs  and as a result  sales of motorhomes represent approximately percent of total rv retail sales dollars 
in the first half of  wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary market  exceeded retail sales  resulting in increased dealer inventories 
in response to high inventory levels  beginning in august  dealers reduced their orders for new rvs  causing wholesale shipments to decline 
this trend continued in  with wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs declining percent according to the recreational vehicle industry association rvia  compared to an increase in retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs of approximately percent per statistical surveys  inc  an indication that there has been a reduction in dealer inventories 
however  retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs declined about percent for the two month period november and december after eight consecutive month over month increases 
recent rv dealer surveys indicate that inventories  although well below year earlier levels  are still slightly higher than dealers would prefer in this uncertain economic environment 
while retail demand held up in until october  the company cannot predict the potential impact on the rv industry of a softer economy  as well as the volatility in the real estate and mortgage markets in the rvia has projected a percent decline in wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs declined approximately percent in january in the long term  rv sales are expected to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the us population 
us census bureau projections released in march  project that there will be in excess of million more people over the age of by in  the rvia began a generic advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle 
the current phase is targeted at both parents aged with children at home  and couples aged with no children at home 
the popularity of traveling to nascar and other sporting events  and using rvs as second homes  also appears to be motivation for consumers to purchase rvs 
manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis  transported to the site  and installed under a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction  strength and durability  transportability  fire resistance  energy efficiency and quality 
the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
it is the only federally regulated national building code 
on site additions  such as garages  decks and porches  often add to the attractiveness of manufactured homes and must be built to local  state or regional building codes 
industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes has declined approximately percent since  including an percent decline in  to  homes 
the percent decline in industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes for included a percent decrease in larger  multi section homes produced by the industry  and a percent decrease in smaller  single section homes  in which the company has less average content per home 
this decline has been primarily the a result of i limited credit availability because of high credit standards applied to purchases of manufactured homes  and ii high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes chattel loans are loans secured only by the home which is sited on leased land 
apparently  because of the weak site built housing market  retirees have not been able to sell their primary residence  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase a less expensive manufactured home 
this is borne out by the plus percent decline in sales of manufactured homes in florida  california and arizona for as compared to the prior year  which accounted for nearly half of the industry decline in these three states are traditionally favored by retirees  and usually are among the strongest markets for manufactured homes 
further  in the last several years  many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were instead able to purchase site built homes as subprime mortgages were available to the site built buyers at unrealistic terms 
now that such subprime mortgages are no longer available  certain home buyers may eventually turn to more affordable manufactured homes  although industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes to date have remained below prior year levels 
the company believes that future growth prospects for manufactured housing are positive because of i the quality and affordability of the home  ii the favorable demographic trends  including the increasing number of retirees  who have represented a significant market for manufactured homes  iii pent up demand by retirees who have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence and purchase a manufactured home  and iv the unavailability of subprime mortgages 
while these factors point to the potential for future growth  we cannot predict whether wholesale shipments of manufactured homes will increase in or thereafter 
raw material prices the prices the company pays for steel  which represents about half of the company s raw material costs  and other key raw materials have increased significantly since the beginning of to offset the impact of higher raw material costs  the company implemented sales price increases to its customers 
the company estimates that substantially all raw material cost increases received through were passed on to customers 
the company was notified by suppliers of cost increases of percent or more for certain of its raw materials which are scheduled to go into effect during the first quarter of in addition  higher energy costs continue to affect the costs of raw materials 
the company continues to explore alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestically and from overseas  and evaluate and implement sales price increases to customers where needed to offset the effect of cost increases 
while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that future cost increases can be passed on to customers 
results of operations to make its segment reporting easier to understand  and present segment results in the same format as that used by management to evaluate segment operations  certain items of income and expense that are unrelated to the day to day operations of the segments have been reclassified effective with the fourth quarter of to other items in the company s segment disclosure 
historical segment results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation going forward 
net sales and operating profit  which remain unchanged in total due to the reclassifications  were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate other items total the reclassifications made to prior reported numbers were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands rv segment operating profit mh segment operating profit corporate other items total net sales and operating profit by segment  as a percent of the total  were as follows for the years ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate other items total operating profit margin by segment was as follows for the years ended december  rv segment mh segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for decreased million percent from the decrease in net sales was due to an organic sales decline of about million percent resulting from declines in both the rv and manufactured housing industries  partially offset by sales of million resulting from acquisitions  and sales price increases of approximately million  primarily to offset material cost increases 
the organic sales decline is attributed primarily to a percent decline in industry wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in  as well as an percent decline in industry wholesale shipments of manufactured homes 
despite the sales decline  net income for increased percent from for the following reasons in response to the slowdowns in both the rv and manufactured housing industries  over the past months the company closed facilities and consolidated those operations into other existing facilities  and reduced fixed overhead where prudent  including reducing staff levels by more than salaried employees 
these facility consolidations and fixed overhead reductions increased operating profit in by approximately million million after taxes  and are expected to improve operating profit by more than million in improved production and procurement efficiencies 
increased profit margins on certain of the company s newer product lines  particularly in the axle product line  which had been underperforming 
operating profit was reduced by million million after taxes due to losses at the indiana specialty trailer operation which was closed in september lower workers compensation costs which improved operating profit by approximately million million after taxes 
the impact of acquisitions completed in and the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in a reduction in interest expense of million million after taxes due primarily to a decrease in average debt levels 
these favorable factors were partially offset by the negative impact on of spreading fixed manufacturing and administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
an increase in amortization expense of million million after taxes due to acquisitions 
on july   lippert acquired certain assets  liabilities and the business of extreme engineering  inc extreme engineering  a manufacturer of specialty trailers for high end boats  along with its affiliate  pivit hitch  inc pivit hitch 
extreme engineering and pivit hitch had combined annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the purchase price for the two companies was million  including transaction costs  which was financed from available cash 
extreme engineering s extreme custom trailers are built according to customer specifications  and are sold through dealers and manufacturers of ski boats and high performance boats throughout the united states 
lippert has continued production at extreme engineering s existing leased facility in riverside  california 
lippert has also transferred certain of its existing specialty trailer manufacturing operations to extreme engineering s facility in connection with the consolidation of certain existing west coast factories 
on may   lippert acquired certain assets and the business of coach step  a manufacturer of patented electric steps for motorhomes 
coach step had annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the purchase price was million  which was financed from available cash 
the company integrated coach step s business into existing lippert facilities 
on january   lippert acquired trailair  inc trailair and certain assets and the business of equa flex  inc equa flex  two affiliated companies  which manufacture several patented products  including innovative suspension systems used primarily for towable rvs 
trailair and equa flex had combined annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the minimum aggregate purchase price was million  of which million was paid at closing and the balance will be paid annually over the five years subsequent to the acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price could increase to a maximum of million if certain sales targets for these products are achieved by lippert over the five years subsequent to the acquisition 
the acquisition was financed with borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the company has integrated trailair and equa flex s business into existing lippert facilities 
during the last few years  the company introduced several products for the rv and specialty trailer markets  including products for the motorhome market 
these products include slide out mechanisms and leveling devices for motorhomes  axles for towable rvs and specialty trailers  entry steps  and suspension systems for towable rvs  and bed lifts  ramp doors  thermoformed bath and kitchen products  and exterior panels for both towable rvs and motorhomes 
the company estimates that the market potential for these products is over million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s sales of these products were running at an annualized rate of approximately million  as compared to an annualized rate of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of approximately percent  despite the percent decline in industry wide shipments of rvs 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in decreased percent  or million  as compared to due to an organic sales decline of approximately million  or percent  of rv related products 
the percent organic sales decline in the company s rv related products was lower than the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs excluding an estimated  units purchased by dealers in early related to the gulf coast hurricanes  primarily because the company introduced new products and gained market share 
a decline of approximately million in sales related to the gulf coast hurricanes compared to subsequent to march  there was no significant hurricane related business 
a decline of approximately million in sales of specialty trailers primarily due to the september closure of the indiana specialty trailer operation and a decline in the west coast marine industry 
partially offset by sales resulting from and acquisitions aggregating approximately million 
sales price increases of approximately million  primarily to offset material cost increases 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs  for the years ended december  divided by the wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs by the industry for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs content per motorhomes content per all rvs according to the rvia  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes all rvs despite the million decline in net sales  operating profit of the rv segment in increased percent to million due to an increase in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in  partially offset by the impact of the decline in sales 
the operating profit margin of the rv segment in was favorably impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures 
improved production efficiencies and global sourcing 
increased profit margins on certain of the company s newer product lines  particularly in the axle product line  which had been underperforming 
the elimination of million in segment operating losses incurred in the company s indiana specialty trailer operation in this operation was closed in september lower workers compensation costs 
a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  largely due to cost cutting measures implemented and lower delivery costs 
partially offset by the negative impact on of spreading fixed manufacturing and administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
higher warranty costs  based on claims experience  an industry wide increase in the number of months between production and the retail sale of rvs  and an increase in the portion of the company s products that are more complex 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in decreased percent  or million  as compared to excluding the impact of sales price increases approximately million primarily to offset material cost increases  organic sales of the mh segment decreased approximately million  or percent  compared to an percent decrease in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
the organic decrease in sales of the company s mh segment was greater than the manufactured housing industry decline due partly to a reduction in the average size of the homes produced by the manufactured housing industry  thus requiring less of the company s products  and partly due to a small amount of business the company exited because of inadequate margins 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors  or sections  which can be joined to make larger homes 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for manufactured homes for the years ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per home produced content per floor produced according to the manufactured housing institute mhi  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change total homes produced total floors produced operating profit of the mh segment in decreased percent to million due to the impact of the decrease in net sales  and a decrease in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in the operating profit margin of the mh segment in was negatively impacted by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in partly due to higher delivery costs as a percent of net sales and the spreading of fixed costs over a smaller sales base 
partially offset by implementation of cost cutting measures 
improved production and procurement efficiencies 
the company has remained profitable in the mh segment despite the percent decline in manufactured housing industry production since the company continues to monitor the goodwill and other intangible assets related to this segment for potential impairment 
a continued downturn in this industry could result in an impairment of the goodwill or other intangible assets of this segment 
as of december   the goodwill and other intangible assets of the mh segment aggregated million 
corporate corporate expenses for increased million compared to due primarily to an increase in incentive based compensation as a result of higher profits 
other items in february  the company sold certain intellectual property rights for million  consisting of cash of million at closing and a note of million  payable over five years 
the note was initially recorded net of a reserve of million 
in january and  the company received payments aggregating million and million  respectively  including interest  which had been previously fully reserved  and the company therefore recorded a gain 
the balance of the note is million at december   which is fully reserved 
in january  the company received a scheduled payment on the note of million  including interest 
other items in also included million of expenses related to legal proceedings 
in  sales of facilities and the write down to estimated current market value of facilities to be sold did not have a significant impact on operating profit 
other items in included i a net gain in operating profit of million resulting from the net gain or loss on sold facilities and the write down to estimated current market value of facilities to be sold  and ii million in costs incurred for due diligence in connection with an acquisition which was not completed 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for increased million percent from the increase in net sales in included sales price increases of approximately million and sales of about million resulting from acquisitions 
the balance of the sales growth was generated by sales of newly introduced products and market share gains  partially offset by the decrease in sales related to the gulf coast hurricanes of approximately million and the weakness in both the rv and manufactured housing industries in the latter part of net income for decreased percent from net income declined for several reasons  including the negative impact due to the decline in wholesale shipments in the rv industry during the latter part of more than offset the positive impact of the increase in wholesale shipments in the rv industry during the first half of declines in wholesale shipments in the manufactured housing industry during the year over year decrease in sales of components for emergency housing resulting from the gulf coast hurricanes 
increased losses related to the specialty trailer operation in indiana  which was closed during the third quarter of lower margins on some of the company s newer products  largely due to competitive pressures 
sales of these newer products increased significantly in an increase in stock based compensation expense 
these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact in of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base 
accretive results from happijac  acquired in june  which supplies bed lifts to the toy hauler rv market  net of the related increase in interest and amortization expenses 
the new window factory in arizona  opened in  achieved an operating profit in  compared to a start up loss in the negative impact on results of charges of million million after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation related to legal proceedings 
in response to the slowdowns in both the rv and mh industries in the latter part of  the company reduced its hourly workforce to match current production levels  closed several facilities and consolidated these operations into other existing facilities  and reduced fixed overhead where prudent  including reducing staff levels by more than salaried employees 
on june   lippert acquired certain assets and the business of happijac company happijac  a supplier of patented bed lift systems for recreational vehicles 
happijac  which also manufactures other rv products such as slide out systems  tie down systems and camper jacks  had annualized sales of approximately million prior to the acquisition

steelco had annual sales for the year ended november  of approximately million 
the purchase price was million which was funded with borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the company has integrated steelco s business into lippert s existing facilities in california 
in connection with the transaction  lippert and steelco terminated litigation pending between them 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in increased percent  or million  over sales growth included i organic growth of approximately million  or percent  compared to an percent increase in industry shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  which excludes the emergency living units elus purchased by fema and the estimated travel trailers purchased by dealers restocking units purchased by fema directly from dealers  ii sales price increases of approximately million  and iii the impact of acquisitions of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in hurricane related rv sales 
the company s average content for the rvs and elus purchased by fema was substantially less than the company s average content in typical travel trailers 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs  excluding elus  for the years ended december  divided by the wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs by the industry  excluding elus  for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs content per motorhomes content per all rvs according to the rvia  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes all rvs elus operating profit of the rv segment in increased percent to million due to the increase in net sales  offset by a decrease in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales  compared to percent of net sales in the rv segment operating profit margin in was negatively impacted by the losses incurred in the company s indiana specialty trailer operation which was closed in september million loss in compared to a million loss in  increases in material costs as a percent of sales  lower margins on some of the newer products introduced by the company largely due to competitive pressures  higher delivery costs  and the sharp decline in industry shipments in the latter part of  partially offset by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base and lower overtime and health insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses of this segment increased slightly to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  due to increases in delivery costs and stock based compensation expense due to the stock option grant in november  partially offset by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base  lower incentive compensation expense as a percent of sales  and a decline in the provision for bad debts 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in declined million from excluding the impact of acquisitions approximately million and sales price increases approximately million  sales of the mh segment decreased million  or percent  from  compared to a percent decrease in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
this decline in industry wide production of manufactured homes from to is partly a result of the units purchased by fema during the last four months of the company estimates that its fema related sales in was approximately million higher than the purchases by fema in late and early were primarily single section homes  in which the company has substantially less product content per home than multi section homes 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for manufactured homes for the years ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per homes produced content per floors produced according to the mhi  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change total homes produced total floors produced operating profit of the mh segment in declined percent to million due to the decrease in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in the operating profit margin of the mh segment in was negatively impacted by increases in material costs as a percent of sales and the sharp decline in industry shipments in the latter part of  partially offset by direct labor efficiencies  and lower overtime and delivery costs 
the operating profit of the mh segment was positively affected by the new window factory in arizona  which opened in  and achieved an operating profit in  compared to a start up loss in selling  general and administrative expenses of this segment declined to percent of net sales in  from percent in the decline is due to lower delivery costs and lower incentive compensation expense  partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the stock option grant in november employee stock options have historically been granted in november of every other year 
corporate corporate expenses for increased million compared to the increases for were due largely to i increases in staff costs partly due to the increased corporate governance requirements  and compliance with section of sarbanes oxley  and ii an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the stock option grant in november  partially offset by a decline in incentive based compensation as a result of lower profits 
other items in february  the company sold certain intellectual property rights relating to a process used to manufacture a new composite material

simultaneously with the sale  the company entered into a conditional equipment lease and a license agreement with the buyer 
in march  the buyer and owner of the manufacturing process related to this intellectual property informed the company that it could not perfect the technology required for the company to produce bath products using this new composite material 
therefore  the lease for the production equipment did not become effective 
as a result  in the first quarter of  the company wrote off related capitalized project costs which had a book value of approximately million  largely offsetting the gain on the collection of the note 
other items in included i a net gain in operating profit of million resulting from the net gain on sold facilities and the write down to estimated current market value of facilities to be sold  and ii million in costs incurred for due diligence in connection with an acquisition which was not completed 
other items in included million of expense related to legal proceedings

contingencies on or about october  and october   two actions were commenced in the superior court of the state of california  county of sacramento  entitled arlen williams  jr 
vs 
weekend warrior trailers  inc  zieman manufacturing company  et 
al 
case no 
cv  and joseph giordano and dennis gish  vs 
weekend warrior trailers  inc  and zieman manufacturing company  et 
al 
case no 
as 
each case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all others similarly situated 
the complaints in both cases are substantially identical and the cases were consolidated 
defendant zieman manufacturing company zieman is a subsidiary of lippert 
mandatory mediation was conducted 
the parties reached a settlement  and entered into a final settlement agreement 
the settlement does not result in material liability to zieman 
on february   the court signed a judgment approving the settlement  subject to appeal within days 
although the company does not anticipate any appeals  there can be no assurance that an appeal will not be asserted 
plaintiffs alleged that defendant weekend warrior sold certain toy hauler trailers during the model years equipped with frames manufactured by zieman that were defective in design and manufacture  causing damage to the trailers and the towing vehicles 
plaintiffs sought monetary damages in an unspecified amount including compensatory  incidental and consequential damages  punitive damages  restitution  declaratory and injunctive relief  attorney s fees and costs 
zieman vigorously defended against the allegations made by plaintiffs  as well as plaintiffs ability to pursue the claims as a class action 
zieman and lippert s liability insurers agreed to defend zieman  subject to reservation of the insurers rights 
on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  inc  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to fire spread control established by the united states department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act sec 
et seq  and the california song beverly consumer warranty act sec 
et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiffs attorneys fees 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
although discovery by plaintiff is continuing  at this point  based on the foregoing investigation and testing  kinro believes that plaintiff may not be able to prove the essential elements of her claim  and defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
in this connection  defendants have filed initial motions seeking summary judgment against plaintiff s case to be supplemented and refiled  seeking sanctions against plaintiff and her attorneys for destroying the bathtub which is the subject of this litigation  and challenging the propriety of a class action 
moreover  kinro believes that  because test results received by kinro confirm that it is in compliance with hud safety standards  no remedial action is required or appropriate 
in october  the parties participated in voluntary non binding mediation in an effort to reach a settlement 
kinro made an offer of settlement consistent with its belief regarding the merits of plaintiff s allegations 
although no settlement was reached  the parties have since had intermittent discussions 
the outcome of such settlement efforts cannot be predicted 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzales as the class representative 
the court ruled that plaintiff may not be an appropriate class representative for injunctive relief because her bathtub had been replaced 
the court granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add a different plaintiff 
the court also denied  without prejudice  kinro s motion for sanctions based on spoliation of evidence because testing the bathtub of the new plaintiff may affect the ruling on the motion 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations  and intends to continue its vigorous defense against both plaintiffs claims 
if settlement is not reached and plaintiffs pursue their claims  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
in connection with a tax audit by the indiana department of revenue pertaining to calendar years to  the company received an initial examination report asserting  in the aggregate  approximately million of proposed tax adjustments  including interest and penalties 
after two hearings with the indiana department of revenue  the audit findings were upheld 
the company believes that it has properly reported its income and paid taxes in indiana in accordance with applicable laws  and filed an appeal in december with the indiana tax court 
the matter has been scheduled for trial in september in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors  including the company s i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales patterns 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
the company has remained profitable in the mh segment despite the percent decline in manufactured housing industry production since the company continues to monitor the goodwill and other intangible assets related to this segment for potential impairment 
a continued downturn in this industry could result in an impairment of the goodwill or other intangible assets of this segment 
as of december   the goodwill and other intangible assets of the mh segment aggregated million 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  accounts receivable  notes receivable  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  segment allocations  and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
the company was notified by suppliers of cost increases of percent or more for certain raw materials which are scheduled to go into effect during the first quarter of in addition  higher energy costs continue to affect the costs of raw materials 
the company did not experience any significant increase in its labor costs in related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
on october   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap with keybank national association with an initial notional amount of million from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate percent at december  based upon the november  reset date  and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of percent  with settlement and rate reset dates every november  february  may and august the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by million on each quarterly reset date 
at december   the notional amount was million 
the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap was less than million 
the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of certain borrowings under the line of credit pursuant to the credit agreement and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion  which was insignificant  recognized in earnings currently 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt plus million outstanding under the interest rate swap 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be approximately million lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt  excluding the million outstanding under the interest rate swap 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be reduced by less than million per annum 
at december   the company had million of temporary investments in money market funds 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for these variable rate investments subsequent to december   and total investments of million  future cash flows would be reduced by million per annum 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  or the outstanding borrowings change significantly  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above
