item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
company overview our mission is to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic health care delivery systems 
we have manufacturing locations in north and south america  europe and asia  with affiliates in mexico and japan 
our business is conducted through two segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group 
our pharmaceutical systems segment focuses on primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  and closures and disposable components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems 
the tech group operating segment offers custom contract manufacturing solutions utilizing plastic injection molding and manual and automated assembly processes targeted to the healthcare and consumer products industries 
our global customer base includes the leading american and european manufacturers of pharmaceuticals  biologics and medical devices 
was a record year for our company with consolidated net sales exceeding billion for the first time in west s history 
the majority of our sales growth in recent years has been generated by the performance of our pharmaceutical systems segment 
we believe that the long term business drivers for our pharmaceutical systems products remain strong as we continue to see growth opportunities in pre fillable syringe and other injection delivery systems which require advanced packaging 
increasing regulatory and safety requirements  as well as demographic and related healthcare trends towards an aging population that is more reliant on chronic drug therapies are also favorable to the demand for our products 
our near term sales and operating profit growth in this segment will be affected by insurance reimbursement issues affecting the demand for sales of our customers products  particularly in the biotechnology field 
we also anticipate a sales loss from a lower margin disposable medical product component transferred to in house production by one of our customers 
despite these hurdles  we continue to expect sales growth of approximately in for the pharmaceutical systems segment  driven by customer conversions to our enhanced product offerings including advanced coated components and westar processing and continued demand for pre fillable syringe components and safety and administration systems 
our pharmaceutical systems segment remains committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity and the geographic scope of our operations 
several of our production facilities are operating at or near full capacity and we are currently in the process of expanding capacity at our plants in germany  serbia and singapore in an effort to meet our customers increasing demand for our products 
a portion of the additional manufacturing capacity from these projects will become available toward the end of  with full completion of all projects  including plans for our facility in france  expected by we continue to move forward with our plans to establish a manufacturing facility in china  and in december of we received the required land use rights that will enable us to commence ground breaking activities in the first quarter of for our new plastic production facility 
we also continue to evaluate opportunities for a rubber manufacturing facility in china and to expand our presence in india  including possible acquisitions or joint ventures with local manufacturers 
our tech group segment had a very challenging year in  despite achieving record sales of million on the strength of launch quantity production for the exubera inhalable insulin device and two other significant customer product launches of over the counter products 
operating profit in the segment was lower than in prior years  primarily due to higher than expected costs in transferring production to a new facility in michigan  and higher unrecovered overhead costs due to lower tooling and engineering development project activity 
we anticipate a decline in sales of two over the counter products launched in additionally  on october   pfizer announced that it had decided to discontinue marketing the exubera product 
our tech group segment is one of two contract manufacturers for the inhalation delivery device used with exubera  a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics and licensed to pfizer inc although we will continue to work with and support nektar as they determine how to proceed with this product line  we do not currently anticipate any revenue from the exubera device in or subsequent periods 
sales of the exubera device accounted for approximately million  or slightly more than  of tech group segment revenues in in an effort to align the plant capacity and work force with the current business outlook for the tech group segment  we initiated a restructuring program in  committing to a reduction in spending throughout the segment 
that reduction will come from consolidating two tool production operations into one facility  and by reductions and consolidations of other production  engineering and administrative operations 
we anticipate completing these restructuring programs by the end of  realizing million of cost savings within the year and annual operating savings thereafter of approximately million 
although overall tech group sales in are projected to be approximately below prior year levels  we believe that the combination of the leaner cost structure made possible by these restructuring initiatives and the decline in start up related costs and increased utilization at our recently completed michigan production facility will more than offset the operating profit impact resulting from the loss of the exubera device sales and other revenue related reductions in on a longer term basis  we believe that the tech group segment will benefit from our innovation initiatives in proprietary products incorporating new technologies and advanced injection systems 
we expect consolidated research and development spending in to reach million  approximately more than what was incurred in  and anticipate that the majority of these new injectable packaging and delivery systems will be manufactured by our tech group segment and marketed by our pharmaceutical systems segment 
our consolidated capital spending requirements are expected to remain at their current levels for the next several years as we fund the expansion programs in europe and asia  as well as increased westar and rubber compounding capacity in the united states 
our capital spending budget is set at approximately million  which will allow us to maintain our existing facilities and to increase capacity to meet the continued growth in demand for our pharmaceutical packaging components 
approximately million of the capital spending projection is devoted to information systems projects for manufacturing execution systems and replacement of transactional reporting software  primarily in the americas 
based on our business outlook and the company s capital structure at the close of  we believe that the company s operating cash flow  cash on hand and available credit facilities are more than sufficient to meet the company s operating  research and development  capital investment and financing needs 
we believe that our commitment to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the quality  safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems will result in continued long term growth for our company 
results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december   and our financial position as of december   should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
our financial statements include the results of acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date 
for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year to year results  reference is made in management s discussion and analysis to results excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
those re measured period results are not in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are non gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of  not as a substitute for  the related gaap financial measures 
net sales the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group intersegment sales total net sales  compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  over those achieved in foreign currency translation accounted for million  or percentage points  of the sales growth 
excluding foreign currency translation  net sales increased million or over the prior year 
the pharmaceutical systems segment contributed million of the full year sales increase  including million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding foreign currency translation  pharmaceutical systems sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the sales increase over the prior year  with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume 
sales growth was strong in all geographical regions of the segment  driven by strong demand for serum stoppers used in vial packaging for vaccines  injectable treatments for chronic diseases  and increased demand for pre filled injection system components 
westar  our validated process for washing and siliconizing stoppers enabling the entry of our products directly into our customers steam sterilizing process  continues to lead the demand for our products  often in combination with value added coatings such as flurotec films and teflon barriers that decrease the risk of particulate contamination and increase the lubricity of stoppers and other components thereby increasing the efficiency of our customers production processes 
tech group segment full year sales were million above prior year levels  million of which resulted from foreign currency translation 
excluding foreign currency translation  tech group segment sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the sales increase in the tech group segment  with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume 
the tech group segment sales increase included a million increase in sales to nektar of the exubera device resulting from the timing of the product launch by pfizer in the united states earlier in the year 
tech group segment sales also benefited from strong sales of weight loss product packaging  an intra nasal delivery system and surgery devices  but these were largely offset by a million decline in revenue from tooling and design projects 
compared to consolidated net sales increased over sales reported in net sales for include a full twelve months of results from the businesses acquired during the timing impact of our acquisitions accounts for percentage points of the sales increase 
favorable foreign currency translation contributed percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales increased over sales 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment  net sales were million   above levels 
the timing impact associated with the acquisitions of medimop and monarch accounted for percentage points of the increase 
foreign currency translation accounted for another percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were  above those achieved in sales growth was achieved in both domestic and international markets with sales increases of in the united states and in international markets 
strong demand for pharmaceutical packaging products  including westar processed components  specially coated stoppers and pre filled syringe components accounted for of the sales increase 
sales of disposable medical components accounted for the remaining sales increase over the prior year 
net sales of personal care products  laboratory and other services remained approximately equal to prior year levels 
in our tech group segment  net sales were million above those reported in the prior year 
the acquired tgi business accounted for million of the increase in segment sales  of which million is attributed to the timing of the acquisition 
the remaining million of the acquired business s sales increase represents volume related gains  approximately of which is attributed to net sales of a delivery device for the exubera product 
other healthcare device revenues and increased sales of consumer products account for the remainder of the acquired business s volume related gains 
our previously existing plastic molding operations  which represent the balance of the tech group segment  recorded a net sales increase of million over the prior year on higher sales of juice container closures  nurser assemblies  and containers for pain relief medication  contraceptives and weight loss products 
gross profit the following table summarizes our gross profit and related gross margins by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems gross profit gross margin tech group gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit consolidated gross margin compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over  consisting of a million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment gross profit and a million decrease in tech group segment gross profit 
foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase in consolidated gross profit 
the gross margin within the pharmaceutical systems segment declined moderately compared to that achieved in  primarily due to higher plant overhead costs including the addition of engineering and other staff in support of our expansion projects  increased manufacturing  supply and maintenance costs resulting from strained capacity levels at several facilities in europe  and higher depreciation charges on machinery and equipment upgrades 
the tech group segment gross profit and gross margin declines primarily reflect million of incremental costs associated with the relocation and start up of our new facility in michigan 
compared to consolidated gross profit improved to million in  a million increase over results 
the timing of the acquisitions accounts for million million in the tech group segment of the increase in gross profit as includes these businesses for the full twelve month period as compared to partial year periods in increased sales volumes and improvement in the sales product mix in both segments of our business accounted for nearly all of the non acquisition related increase in consolidated gross profit 
research and development r d costs the following table summarizes r d costs by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group total r d costs at the end of  we created an innovation group responsible for seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems  most of which will be manufactured by our tech group segment and marketed by our pharmaceutical systems segment 
the increase in r d costs reflects the formation of this new team 
our development projects are a response to the market opportunities created by the convergence of primary drug packaging and delivery systems and include initiatives in traditional injection systems  components for pen system applications and auto injectors with cartridges 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs the following table summarizes sg a costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs in millions pharmaceutical systems sg a costs pharmaceutical systems sg a as a of segment net sales tech group sg a costs tech group sg a as a of segment net sales corporate costs general corporate costs stock based compensation expense us pension plan expense total sg a costs total sg a as a of total net sales compared to consolidated sg a expenses were million above those recorded in in the pharmaceutical systems segment  sg a expenses increased by million compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase was compensation related  including increased staffing of sales  strategic marketing and information systems functions  the impact of annual salary increases and higher incentive compensation program costs 
foreign currency translation accounted for million of the to increase in pharmaceutical system segment sg a costs 
professional service and consulting costs related to the implementation of new information systems in the united states and sales commission charges were million higher in than in the remaining million increase in sg a costs consisted mostly of higher software maintenance  computer related supply costs  and depreciation expense 
sg a costs in the tech group segment were million above the prior year 
higher staffing levels in quality control  human resource and other functions together with annual salary growth accounted for million of the increase 
sales commissions were million higher than in foreign currency translation  travel costs and bad debt expense contributed equally to the remaining million increase 
general corporate sg a costs  which include executive and board of directors compensation  legal  compliance  finance and communication expenses were million lower in than in these costs include incentive compensation costs for the majority of our executive officers  as well as above or below target performance adjustments for operating segment management 
incentive compensation payments are made based on the achievement of sales  operating profit  earnings per share and cash flow goals 
incentive compensation costs were million lower than in  primarily due to the achievement of above target performance levels resulting in above target bonus payouts in  compared to incentive compensation which was below target 
stock based compensation costs for decreased by million when compared to those recorded in  due primarily to a decrease in west stock price indexed compensation costs 
our stock price decreased per share during  closing at per share on december  in  our stock price increased per share closing at per share at december  our deferred compensation plans held approximately  and  stock units at december  and  respectively 
the resulting change in the fair value of our deferred stock unit liabilities accounts for almost all of the decrease in the comparison of and stock based compensation costs  partially offset by higher stock option and employee stock purchase plan costs 
us pension plan expenses in were million lower than those incurred during the decrease largely results from a amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
under the amended plan  benefits earned under the plan s pension formulas and accruals for both hourly and salaried participants were frozen as of december  and replaced with new cash balance formulas resulting in a reduction of our projected benefit obligation 
compared to consolidated sg a expenses in were million above those recorded in approximately million of the increase is due to the timing impact of our acquired businesses which are included in for the periods subsequent to their acquisition and for a full twelve month period in in the pharmaceutical systems segment  sg a expenses were million above the prior year 
the timing of the medimop acquisition accounts for million of this increase 
compensation costs were million higher than in  reflecting a combination of annual salary increases  bonus costs  and staffing increases in sales and production support functions in europe  asia and for our global reconstitution product lines 
organization and travel costs primarily related to the establishment of our business in china were million higher in compared to foreign currency translation accounted for million of the sg a increase 
other expenses associated mostly with higher facility costs and social taxes accounted for the remaining million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment sg a costs 
tech group segment sg a costs were million above the prior year 
the timing of the tgi acquisition accounts for million of the increase 
the initial participation in incentive compensation programs and increased staffing levels in human resource functions  quality and internal control positions accounted for the remaining sg a increase 
general corporate sg a costs were million higher than in as a result of exceeding performance targets  incentive compensation awards accounted for million of the increase  including a million increase in award programs for plant administration and hourly personnel 
other general corporate compensation costs increased million due mostly to increased finance and legal staffing and higher salary and fringe benefit costs 
professional service costs were million above those recorded in primarily as a result of higher tax consulting costs connected with prior year tax refund issues 
stock based compensation costs increased by million over those incurred in primarily due to the increase in west stock price indexed deferred compensation program costs for our board of directors and a non qualified deferred compensation plan for executive management 
as of december  these deferred compensation plans held  stock equivalent units 
our stock price at december  was per share compared to per share at december  the resulting change in the fair value of our stock equivalent unit liabilities accounts for nearly all of the million increase in our stock based compensation expense 
costs of other stock based compensation programs  including stock options  performance vesting share rights and employee stock purchase programs  remained approximately even with prior year levels as moderately higher stock option compensation was offset by lower costs associated with the employee stock purchase program 
us pension plan costs were million  exceeding costs by million 
the increase in us pension costs is primarily due to changes in actuarial mortality assumptions 
on october  our board of directors approved an amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
under the amended plan  benefits earned under the former plan s pension formulas for both hourly and salaried participants were frozen as of december  effective january   new cash balance formulas were implemented for covered hourly and salaried participants and new hires  pursuant to which a percentage of a participant s compensation will be credited to a participant account each year 
restructuring  impairment and other charges other expense  consisting of gains  losses or impairments of segment assets  foreign exchange transaction items  miscellaneous royalty and sundry transactions are generally recorded within the respective operating segment 
certain costs deemed to be outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our operating segments 
the following table summarizes our restructuring  impairment and other charges for each of the years ended december   and  respectively in millions pharmaceutical systems segment tech group segment unallocated charges credits impairment charge customer contract restructuring and related charges credits brazilian excise tax and other charges total unallocated charges credits total restructuring  impairment and other charges on october   pfizer announced that it had decided to discontinue marketing exubera  a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics and licensed to pfizer inc our tech group segment is one of two contract manufacturers for the inhalation delivery device used with exubera 
although we are continuing to work with and support nektar as they determine how to proceed with this product line  we do not currently anticipate any revenue from the exubera device in or subsequent periods 
accordingly  we have recorded a million impairment charge representing our full net investment in the nektar contract intangible asset as of december  under an agreement reached with nektar in february  tech group will receive full reimbursement for  among other things  severance related employee costs  inventory  purchased raw materials and components  lease and other facility costs 
the agreement also provides funding for the tech group to maintain its production facility through december  while nektar decides how to resolve its plans for the exubera product 
on december   the board of directors of west pharmaceutical services  inc approved a restructuring plan for our tech group segment 
the plan proactively addresses anticipated changes in customers marketing plans for certain products and aligns the plant capacity and workforce with the current business outlook and longer term strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products 
the total cost of the restructuring plan is estimated at approximately million  consisting of million in severance obligations for approximately employees representing of the segment s workforce  million in asset related charges and million for lease and contract termination fees 
we incurred million of these restructuring charges in  and expect to incur costs of approximately million by the end of during  we increased our accruals for a series of excise  gross receipts and value added tax contingencies in brazil by million 
the increased provisions followed a detailed review of several related tax cases pending in the brazilian courts  which now indicate that it is probable that the positions taken on previous tax filings  some of which date back to the late s  will not be sustained 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows in millions pharmaceutical systems segment tech group segment corporate and other unallocated costs general corporate costs stock based compensation costs us pension expenses other unallocated items consolidated operating profit compared to our consolidated operating profit decreased by million from that achieved in operating profit for includes million in unallocated costs consisting of a million restructuring charge  a million impairment of a customer contract intangible asset  and a million provision for tax issues in brazil 
the pharmaceutical systems segment s results exceed those of the prior year by million  benefiting from sales growth  a favorable product mix and the million impact of foreign currency translation  which combined to more than offset other cost increases 
tech group segment operating profit was million below that achieved in the prior year  largely due to costs incurred during the relocation and validation of a new production facility in michigan 
general corporate  stock based compensation and us pension plan costs were all lower than those incurred in the prior year  with the significant decrease in stock price indexed deferred compensation programs attributed to the decline in our stock price during compared to the strong increase in stock price experienced in compared to the businesses acquired during contributed million pharmaceutical systems million and tech group million of the million operating profit increase over the remaining increase in operating profit from to was generated by sales growth and gross margin improvements in both of our business segments  partially offset by higher costs associated with deferred compensation obligations indexed to our stock price 
loss on debt extinguishment on february  we prepaid million in senior notes carrying a interest rate and a maturity date of april  under the terms of the original note purchase agreement dated april   the prepayment of the notes entitled note holders to a make whole amount of million in order to compensate them for interest rate differentials between the yield on the notes and current market rates for the remaining term of the note 
the prepayment was financed by issuing million approximately million of new senior unsecured notes at a weighted average interest rate of  before costs 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes our net interest expense in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense  net our net interest expense was million lower than that incurred in due largely to refinancing and investing activities and higher capitalized interest on our capital expansion projects in europe and in michigan 
during we issued million of convertible debt at a fixed interest rate 
interest expense on the convertible notes totaled million for the year ended december  the incremental interest expense from the convertible notes was partially offset in the comparison of the and periods by favorable rate and volume variances totaling million and million  respectively  resulting from reduced borrowing levels on our revolving credit facility and our refinancing activities 
our interest income is million favorable to that recorded in the additional interest income was generated from the investment of a substantial portion of the proceeds from our convertible debt offering 
our net interest expense decreased million from levels 
the refinancing of our million senior notes resulted in interest savings of million 
these savings were partially offset by unfavorable interest rate variances on our revolving debt of million  and million resulting from higher average borrowing levels associated with the financing and timing of our business acquisitions 
interest income includes million of interest paid to us in connection with the settlement of tax refund issues 
income taxes the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was in  in and in tax expense in includes million of discrete tax benefits  consisting of the reversal of a million valuation allowance related to certain tax credits generated in previous periods that was initially provided due to uncertainty in the generation of sufficient taxable income to utilize the credits  million of tax benefits principally resulting from the revision of certain tax planning strategies and the completion of related documentation supporting research and development credits related to prior year tax returns  and a million tax benefit resulting from the closure of certain us federal and state tax audit years 
our results also include a million provision related to our review of prior year brazilian tax returns 
the combined impact of the million in discrete tax benefits  offset by the million tax provision in brazil  decreased tax expense by million  and lowered our effective tax rate by percentage points 
excluding these discrete tax items  the effective tax rate was income tax expense in includes a net million favorable adjustment primarily resulting from the closure of the us federal tax audit year and a million tax benefit resulting from a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico 
the combined impact of these two items reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in we repatriated million in earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the united states parent companies 
the foreign repatriations were made in accordance with the provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the ajca provided a temporary incentive for us multi national companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in controlled foreign corporations by providing an percent dividends received deduction on qualified distributions occurring before december  our results include a million net tax charge million gross tax cost  less million of foreign tax credits and million in previously established accruals for unremitted earnings incurred in connection with the repatriation program which increased our overall effective tax rate by percentage points 
the restructuring credit in the uk allowed us to utilize prior year loss carry forwards and therefore decreased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in addition  we reduced tax contingencies connected with the closure of tax years in certain international locations resulting in a percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate 
equity in affiliates the contribution to earnings from our ownership interest in daikyo seiko  ltd 
in japan and ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
our equity income from daikyo was million above that recorded in daikyo s sales were above prior year levels  their gross margins improved by three percentage points  and their operating profit improved due to the absence of the impairment charge  discussed below 
these favorable items were partially offset by a loss on sale of an investment security 
our equity income from our affiliated companies in mexico was approximately equal to prior year amounts 
our equity income from daikyo was million below that recorded in daikyo s sales and operating growth were approximately above those achieved in  however the increase in the us dollar relative to the japanese yen fully offset the operational gains 
daikyo s results include a million loss related to a decision by daikyo to demolish an existing facility in order to proceed with the construction of a new plant 
the charge was largely offset by an unrelated gain on an investment security 
our equity income from our mexican affiliates declined million from levels following the transfer of some customer products to our fully owned plant in kinston  north carolina 
our purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately million in  million in and million in  the majority of which relates to our distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
our results include the impact of restructuring charges  an impairment loss on our customer contract intangible asset with nektar for the exubera device  and our provisions for brazilian tax issues which collectively totaled million pre tax million net of tax  or per diluted share

per diluted share 
discontinued operations our results include a million provision for potential claims resulting from the divestiture of our former drug delivery business 
our income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
as a result of a favorable outcome to our claim for tax benefits relating to the sale of our former contract manufacturing and packaging business  we received a tax refund resulting in the recognition of a million tax benefit 
the settlement of this claim also resulted in pre tax interest income of million million after taxes 
we also recognized a million favorable adjustment to tax accruals associated with our former drug delivery systems segment primarily as a result of the closure of the us federal tax audit year 
income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
the majority of the income was generated from the august sale of the clinical services unit pre tax gain of million  million net of tax 
operating losses and other costs associated with the sale of our former drug delivery business completed in the first quarter of totaled million million  net of tax  more than offsetting the operating income of million million  net of tax generated by the clinical services unit prior to its divestiture 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operations totaled million in  compared to million in operating cash flows include the impact of our decision to remit million to the government of brazil in order to discontinue the accretion of further interest and penalties on tax related contingencies awaiting final disposition in the brazilian courts 
our operating cash flow in includes the impact of the million make whole payment incurred as part of the extinguishment of our former senior note agreement 
cash flows used in investing activities for include capital spending totaling million  a million increase over capital spending 
capital spending in our pharmaceutical systems segment was million  compared to million in the increase in capital spending in the pharmaceutical systems segment is largely due to significant projects to expand our molding  production and tooling capacity at our existing facilities in europe and in singapore 
our capital spending includes million in connection with our program to establish a manufacturing presence in china  consisting of the acquisition of land use rights  architectural and other design costs for the new plant  and the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  some of which will be placed into production in our german facility prior to the completion of our plant in china 
pharmaceutical system segment capital spending also included a million investment in information system projects in north america 
tech group segment capital spending was million  compared to million in during  we completed a plant relocation and expansion project in michigan which accounted for million and million of the tech group segment s capital spending in each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
general corporate capital spending for and was million and million  respectively 
in march of  we invested million into a strategic cash portfolio fund managed by the bank of america corporation 
the fund invests in a variety of asset backed securities  the majority of which are rated aaa by standard and poors corp 
in december of  bank of america announced that it would not accept new subscription or redemption requests and intended to liquidate the fund 
we received a million redemption of our investment in december of and anticipate that virtually all of the investment will be redeemed during our net cash investment in the fund of million is reported within cash flow from investing activities in our cash flow statement 
other investing cash flows also include the acquisition of patents and related assets totaling million and million in proceeds resulting from the disposition of an investment in a tool shop in ireland

other cash flows used in financing activities in include the payment of cash dividends totaling million per share 
the board of directors intends to continue the practice of declaring dividends following their quarterly review of the west pharmaceutical services inc s financial condition and results of operations 
management expects that cash flows from continuing operations  net of capital spending requirements  will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy 
other cash flows provided by financing activities included a total of million from the employee stock ownership programs 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect the obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin on january  see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits under fin was million as of december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of cash flows related to these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities  we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods and amounts 
no other significant changes to contractual obligations occurred during payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total in millions unconditional purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pensions other post retirement obligations total contractual obligations future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using the applicable ending interest rate at december  we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the united states 
the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  at december   our consolidated debt was million  compared to million at december   and our net debt debt  less cash and cash equivalents to total invested capital net debt  minority interests and shareholders equity ratio was compared to at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance was million at december   compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million compared with million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to the majority of the change in debt and cash balances resulted from the issuance of convertible debt as previously discussed  net of our share buyback activity 
we believe that our financial condition  current capitalization and expected income from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our future expected cash requirements 
off balance sheet agreements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of west pharmaceutical services  inc revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from our standard product manufacturing operations which convert rubber  metal  and plastic raw materials into component parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices 
sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments  which we have determined to be the americas and europe asia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment  and the tech group segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position
