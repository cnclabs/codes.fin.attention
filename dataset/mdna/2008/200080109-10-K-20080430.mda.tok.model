item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have a revenue sharing agreement in place that determines how much revenue we earn from swissqual sales and  conversely  how much revenue swissqual earns from our sales to customers located outside the european region through december  the 
table of contents revenue sharing is based upon sales of upgrades to the current installed base of seven 
five systems 
both the revenue sharing that we earn from swissqual and that we pay to swissqual under the agreement is expected to diminish over time as both companies have introduced new products into the marketplace 
during november  in response to increased competition in the qos market  we announced a cooperative alliance with ascom schweiz ag ascom  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we are currently developing harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards  accelerating the availability of upgrades to the installed base in europe and our home markets  while enabling the rapid deployment of new products 
these harmonized products and solutions became available during the third quarter of fiscal additionally  we will share sales and support resources with ascom on a global basis and we no longer intend to maintain a separate direct sales and support organization for our european region 
call box we market and sell our call boxes primarily to state and local governmental agencies located in california and new york through a direct sales force located in lake forest  california 
competition chargesource numerous providers  including delta electronics  inc  mobility electronics  inc  targus  belkin  kensington  and apc  sell products that compete directly with our chargesource products 
cellular telephone and personal computer oems also deliver competitors products to the market for our chargesource external power adapters 
many of these distributors and our design and manufacturing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
we believe that the patents that cover our chargesource products provide us with a competitive advantage 
to compete successfully in this market  we believe we must differentiate our offerings through innovation and development of new or enhanced products  successfully meet stringent design specifications in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver low cost products in sufficient volumes on time  and price our products competitively 
wireless test solutions the market for our hardware and software test tools is highly competitive and is served by numerous providers 
our primary competitors with respect to our wts products are agilent technologies  ascom  ericsson  andrew corporation commscope  and swissqual 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
the wireless industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully in this market  we believe we must properly identify customer needs  price our products competitively  differentiate our offerings through innovation and development of new or enhanced products  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time 

table of contents call box the market for our call boxes is served by numerous competitors  including us commlink  gai tronics  talk a phone  and other manufacturers of wireless and wireline emergency and information communication devices 
certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
to compete successfully in the call box market  we believe we must price our products and services competitively  and manufacture and deliver our products and services on time 
key customers we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
chargesource in fiscal   and  kensington  our primary distributor of chargesource products  accounted for revenue totaling million  million  and million  or percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated revenue  respectively 
wireless test solutions in fiscal   and  verizon accounted for revenue totaling million  million  and million  or percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated revenue  respectively 
in fiscal and  swissqual  our former exclusive distributor of wts products in our european region  accounted for million and million  or percent and percent of total consolidated revenue  respectively 
during fiscal  revenue earned from swissqual was negligible  primarily due to the termination of the sales alliance in december call box our call box business derives a significant portion of its revenue from state and local governmental agencies 
in fiscal   and  revenue from these governmental agencies totaled million  million  and million  or percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated revenue  respectively 
the spending patterns of verizon  kensington  or any of our other key customers can vary significantly from year to year 
any significant reduction in the spending patterns of these customers could adversely affect our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
international operations we sell our chargesource and wts products to customers located throughout the world 
in fiscal   and  we derived percent  percent  and percent of total revenue  respectively  from customers in the united states and percent  percent  and percent  respectively  from customers in foreign countries  as determined by the ship to address 
the decrease in the percentage of sales to foreign countries during fiscal and as compared to fiscal is primarily due to decreasing sales of our wts products to swissqual 
in fiscal   and  there were no foreign countries from which we derived more than percent of total revenue 
research and development we sell our products in markets that are characterized by rapid technology changes  frequent new product introductions  and evolving technology standards 
accordingly  we devote significant resources to designing and 
table of contents developing new and enhanced products that can be manufactured cost effectively and sold at competitive prices 
during fiscal   and we incurred approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in research and development expenses 
to focus these efforts  we strive to maintain close relationships with our customers and develop products that meet their needs 
as of april   we had approximately engineers  of whom are dedicated chargesource engineers  and other technical personnel dedicated to our research and development efforts 
generally  our research and development and other engineering efforts are managed and focused on a product by product basis  and can generally be characterized as follows we collaborate closely with our customers and partners to design and manufacture new products or modify existing products to specifications required by our customers  we design and manufacture enhancements and improvements to our existing products in response to our customers requests or feedback  and we independently design and build new products in anticipation of the needs of our customers as they transition existing wireless networks to next generation technologies 
manufacturing and suppliers for our wts and call box products  we maintain one iso certified manufacturing facility in lake forest  california 
for all three businesses  our manufacturing process involves the final assembly and test of individual components by production technicians 
the components used by us consist primarily of printed circuit boards and related assemblies  specialized subassemblies  fabricated housings and chassis  and test mobiles 
most of our components and subassemblies are manufactured by third parties to our specifications and are generally delivered to us for final assembly and test 
during fiscal  we ceased manufacturing our chargesource products in house and transitioned all manufacturing responsibility related to these products to contract manufacturers located in china 
patents and intellectual property we hold patents that cover key technical aspects of our chargesource products 
for our wts business  we generally rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect our intellectual property embodied in the hardware and software products 
industry practices impacting working capital our working capital and operating cash flow is affected by our need to balance inventory levels with customer demand 
existing industry practices that affect our working capital and operating cash flow include i the level of variability of customer orders relative to the volume of production  ii vendor lead times  iii materials availability for critical parts  iv inventory levels necessary to achieve rapid customer fulfillment  and v the granting of extended payment terms to certain foreign customers 
currently  we sell our products under purchase orders that are placed with short term delivery requirements 
as a result  we periodically maintain significant levels of inventory of long lead components in order to meet our expected obligations 
delays in planned customer orders could result in higher inventory levels and negatively impact our operating results 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 

table of contents employees as of april   we employed approximately employees 
we believe our employee relations to be good 
the majority of our employees are professional or technical personnel who possess training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly the highly skilled engineers involved in the development of new products 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and the loss of key employees  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contribution of our executive officers and other key employees 
during december  the board of directors approved and adopted the equity incentive plan the plan covering  shares of our common stock 
the adoption of the plan was ratified by our shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting held on june  item a 
risk factors failure to adjust our operations in response to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
the spending patterns of many of our wts customers have been volatile  unpredictable  and driven by market and technological factors that we cannot control or predict 
in addition  consumer demand for our chargesource mobile power products has been subject to fluctuations as a result of our choices of distribution partners  market acceptance of our products  the timing and size of customer orders  and consumer demand for rechargeable mobile electronic devices 
accordingly  it has been difficult for us to forecast the demand for these products 
we also are limited in our ability to quickly adapt our manufacturing and related cost structures to changing market conditions because a significant portion of our sales and marketing  design and other engineering  and manufacturing costs are fixed 
if customer demand for our wts and chargesource products declines or if we otherwise fail to accurately forecast reduced customer demand  we will likely experience excess capacity  which could adversely affect our operating results 
conversely  if market conditions improve  our manufacturing capacity may not be adequate to fill increased customer demand 
as a result  we might not be able to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our wts products to customers in the wireless communications industry 
we are currently experiencing a significant decrease in revenue caused by widespread industry consolidation including substantial delays in purchasing decisions by our customers and reduced demand for our products 
if these market conditions continue  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
revenue from the sale of our wts products accounted for percent of total revenue for fiscal wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
despite this greater emphasis  current demand for our wts products has decreased compared to the prior fiscal year driven by widespread industry consolidation  delays in purchasing decisions by our customers  increased competition  and increased pricing pressure 
if these market conditions continue  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our call box revenue in fiscal was derived from non recurring upgrades of call boxes for government customers 
if we are unable to replace this revenue stream  our operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted 

table of contents approximately million and million of our fiscal and call box revenue was generated from sales of digital and text telephony upgrades to our installed base of call boxes 
during fiscal we expect to substantially complete the previously awarded digital and tty upgrade contracts 
we expect call box revenue for fiscal to decrease compared to fiscal if we are unable to replace this revenue stream  our operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted 
the chargesource and wts products we make are complex and have short life cycles 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products  some of our products may become obsolete and our operating results could suffer 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
additionally  our chargesource mobile power products have short life cycles  and may become obsolete over relatively short periods of time 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  introduce  and deliver on a timely basis and in sufficient quantity new products  components  and enhancements 
the success of any new product offering will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs and technological trends  timely develop new technologies and applications  price our products and services competitively  timely manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volume  and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
development of new products requires high levels of innovation from both our engineers and our component suppliers 
development of a new product often requires a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the product 
if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products that do not achieve broad market acceptance  our operating results may suffer 
our operating results may also be adversely affected due to the timing of product introductions by competitors  especially if a competitor introduces a new product before our own comparable product is ready to be introduced 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are highly competitive  and our profitability will be adversely affected if we are not able to compete effectively 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries in which we sell our products are highly competitive 
we compete on many levels  including the timing of development and introduction of new products  technology  price  quality  customer service  and support 
our competitors range from some of the respective industries largest corporations to relatively small and highly specialized firms 
many of our competitors possess advantages over us  including greater financial and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger and more established customer and supplier relationships 
our competitors also may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
if we do not have the resources or expertise necessary to compete or to match our competitors or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and revenue 
the average selling prices of our products may decrease over their sales cycles  especially upon the introduction of new products  which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
our products may experience a reduction in the average selling prices over their respective sales cycles 
further  as we introduce new or next generation products  sales prices of legacy products may decline substantially 
in order to sell products that have a falling average selling price and maintain margins at the same time  we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs 
there can be no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to reduce these costs 
in order to do so  we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products  as well as manage our inventory costs to reduce overall product costs 
if we are unable to reduce the overall production cost of legacy products as new products are introduced  our average gross margins may decline and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenue is dependent in part upon our relationships with our strategic distribution partners and their performance 
if we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with the distributors of our mobile power products  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
our chargesource mobile power products are distributed by kensington  a distributor of consumer electronics 
our success will depend in part upon kensington s ability and willingness to effectively and widely distribute our chargesource products on a non exclusive basis 
if kensington and any other distributors we may do business with in the future do not purchase the volume of products that we anticipate  our revenue and results of operations will suffer 
during november  in response to increased competition in the qos market  we announced a cooperative alliance with ascom  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we have developed harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards  accelerating the availability of upgrades to the installed base in europe and our home markets  while enabling the rapid deployment of new products 
these harmonized products and solutions are now available to the market 
additionally  the companies will share sales and support resources on a global basis 
we believe our alliance with ascom will open sales channels  particularly in our european region 
our success will depend in part upon ascom s ability to capture the current installed base in europe  as well as to provide sales and support services in that region 
if we are unable to sell our jointly developed harmonized products  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of customers  and any loss of  cancellation  or delay in purchases by these customers could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our two key customers for fiscal accounted for million  or percent of total revenue 
we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a large percentage of our revenue in the future 
if any of our key customers reduces  cancels  or delays orders  and we are not able to develop other customers who purchase products at comparable levels  our revenue could decrease significantly 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more of our key customers would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience quality or safety defects in our products that could cause us to institute product recalls  require us to provide replacement products and harm our reputation 
in the course of conducting our business  we experience and attempt to address various quality and safety issues with our products 
often product defects are identified during our design  development  and manufacturing processes  which we are able to correct in a timely manner 
sometimes  defects are identified after introduction and shipment of products 
if we are unable to fix defects in a timely manner or adequately address quality control issues  our relationships with our customers may be impaired  our reputation may suffer and we may lose customers 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
economic  political  and other risks associated with our international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently maintain sales and support operations in the united states  china  europe  and latin america 
our international operations accounted for approximately percent of total revenue for fiscal accordingly  our business is subject to worldwide economic and market conditions and risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  weaknesses in the economic conditions in particular countries or regions  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest and disruptions  and delays in shipments 
specifically  our chargesource contract manufacturer and a majority of our component suppliers are located in asia 
we do business with our foreign supply base in us dollars 
our costs increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar 
also  we cannot be sure that our international supply base will 
table of contents continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our costs will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
these factors could adversely affect our ability to outsource our manufacturing and supply needs to foreign countries as well as our sales of products and services in international markets 
our failure to address laws and regulations governing our government contracts  could adversely affect our call box business and operating results 
we depend on contracts with state and local governmental agencies for a significant portion of our call box revenue  and are subject to various laws and regulations that only apply to companies doing business with the government 
for example  we supply call boxes and provide installation and long term maintenance services to regional and municipal transit authorities and other governmental agencies 
in fiscal  we derived percent of our revenue from contracts with these governmental customers 
from time to time we are also subject to investigation for compliance with regulations governing our government contracts 
our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in suspension of these contracts  or subject us to administrative claims 
disruptions in our relationships with our suppliers or in our suppliers operations could result in shortages of necessary components and adversely affect our operations 
we currently procure  and expect to continue to procure  certain components from single source manufacturers who provide unique component designs or who meet certain quality and performance requirements 
in addition  we sometimes purchase customized components from single sources in order to take advantage of volume pricing discounts 
in fiscal  one of the contract manufacturers for our chargesource products provided million  or percent of all inventory purchases  and the contract manufacturer of our printed circuit boards provided million  or percent of all inventory purchases 
the performance of these suppliers is largely outside of our control 
in the past  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  shortages of important single source components 
our suppliers may fail to timely deliver components or provide components of sufficient quality 
if this occurs  we may need to adjust both product designs and production schedules  which could result in delays in the production and delivery of products to our customers 
these delays or defects could harm our reputation  impair our customer relationships  and adversely affect our operations 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation  settlement or licensing costs and expenses or be prevented from selling certain products 
third parties have claimed  and may in the future claim  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
these intellectual property infringement claims  whether we ultimately are found to be infringing any third party s intellectual property rights or not  are time consuming  costly to defend  and divert resources and management attention away from our operations 
infringement claims by third parties also could subject us to significant damage awards or fines or require us to pay large amounts to settle such claims 
additionally  claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on acceptable terms or substitute similar technology from other sources  we could be prevented from or restricted in selling our products containing  or manufactured with  the infringed technology 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights  and we may be required to spend significant resources enforcing these rights or otherwise suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws in the united states and in certain other countries  and upon confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  and partners to establish and maintain our intellectual proprietary rights in our proprietary technology 
we are required to spend significant resources to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights  however these rights might not necessarily provide us with a sufficient competitive advantage 
our intellectual proprietary rights could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by competitors or others 
our employees  customers or partners could breach our confidentiality agreements  for which we may not have an adequate remedy available 
we also may not be able to timely detect the infringement of our intellectual property rights 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position 

table of contents if we suffer the loss of our manufacturing facility due to catastrophe  our operations would be adversely affected 
we have one manufacturing facility  which is located in lake forest  california 
although we carry insurance for property damage  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for all possible catastrophes  including interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
any significant disruption in our manufacturing operations at the facility  whether due to fire  natural disaster  or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
additionally  as previously discussed  during fiscal we transitioned the manufacturing of our chargesource products to a contract manufacturer located in china 
if any significant disruption occurs in the facility in china  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend upon the services of key personnel  and may not be able to attract and retain additional key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  and executive personnel 
if for any reason our key personnel left our employ and we failed to replace a sufficient number of these personnel  we might not be able to maintain or expand our business 
competition for such highly skilled personnel in our wireless communications and consumer electronics industries is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire or re hire sufficiently qualified personnel in adequate numbers to meet the demand for our products and services 
if we are unable to identify  hire  and integrate these skilled personnel in a timely or cost efficient manner  our operating results could suffer 
we may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our businesses  which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms 
we currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating income will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is not assured that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long term growth of our business 
in particular  we may experience a negative operating cash flow due to the timing of anticipated sales of our products 
we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on acceptable terms or we may seek working capital financing under a revolving line of credit 
we cannot be certain that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and  if our operating results decline or are worse than expected  our stock price could fall 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results for our three business segments 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  the degree and rate of growth in the markets in which we compete and the accompanying demand for our products  limitations in our ability to forecast our manufacturing needs  our ability to introduce  and the timing of our introductions of  new or enhanced products  product failures and recalls  product quality control problems and associated in field service support costs  warranty expenses  availability and cost of components  and changes in average sales prices 

table of contents due to these and other factors  our past results are not reliable indicators of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed due to sales  engineering  and manufacturing overhead 
if we experience a decline in revenue  we may be unable to reduce our fixed costs quickly enough to compensate for the decline  which would magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
if our operating results decline or are below expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our stock may decline significantly 
our stock price has been and will likely remain highly volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology and wireless communications companies in particular  have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry stock price fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
the market price of our stock has exhibited significant price fluctuations  which makes our stock unsuitable for many investors 
our stock price may also be affected by the following factors our quarterly operating results  changes in the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries  changes in the economic outlook of the particular markets in which we sell our products and services  the gain or loss of significant customers  reductions in demand or expectations of future demand by our customers  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors  or our customers  the timing and announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors or by us  and other events affecting other companies that investors deem comparable to us 
all of these factors may contribute to the volatility of our stock price 
the trading volume of our common stock often has been limited and may depress the price for our common stock 
a significant decline in our stock price  even if temporary  could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders 
the trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited 
limited trading volume could depress the price for our common stock because fewer analysts may provide coverage for our stock and because investors might be unwilling to pay a higher market price for a stock that is less liquid 
this limited trading volume  along with market and industry stock price fluctuations and other factors affecting our operations  may depress the price for our common stock or result in greater volatility in the price of our common stock

these new chargesource external power adapters are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor or compact size 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our chargesource business in late january  we began volume production of a small form factor watt ac dc external power adapter designed to the stringent specifications of lenovo  a leading notebook computer oem 
this innovative product is currently being marketed and sold as an oem branded aftermarket accessory 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a non exclusive distribution arrangement with kensington  thereby terminating our exclusive distribution agreement 
under the non exclusive agreement  we have the right to penetrate all channels with multiple partners and kensington has the right to purchase our products without volume minimums 
kensington is also able to purchase mobile power products from our competitors 
due to the transition to a non exclusive distribution model  we have experienced and may continue to experience disruption in the sale of our chargesource products over the next several quarters 
chargesource revenue for fiscal decreased significantly to million compared to million for fiscal however  on a sequential basis  chargesource revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased approximately million compared to the prior fiscal quarter 
this sequential increase is attributable to new orders for our existing product line and the initial shipments of the lenovo product 
the current level of chargesource sales is insufficient to fully absorb our fixed manufacturing and supply chain overhead 
our ability to drive increased sales is dependent upon  among others  the following factors successful development and release for manufacture of certain ac and ac dc external power adapter products designed to address the requirements of our retail and oem accessories channels  securing additional retail distribution partners under non exclusive arrangements  and market and customer acceptance of our new products expected to be available by the end of the first quarter of our chargesource products are based on proprietary patented construction technology that enables the production of slim and light power sources for many rechargeable mobile devices from standard wall outlets  as well as power outlets in airplanes  cars  and other modes of transportation 
as of january   we have a backlog of orders from lenovo of  units  and therefore expect our revenue to increase in the first quarter of fiscal wireless test solutions our wts business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and service providers 
radio frequency engineers  network improvement professionals and technicians use these test tools to deploy and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance  and resulting quality of service  of the wireless networks once deployed 
wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
despite this greater emphasis  current demand for our wts products has decreased compared to the prior fiscal year driven by widespread industry consolidation  delays in purchasing decisions by our customers  increased competition  and increased pricing pressure 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our wts business current demand for our next generation mobile test equipment was soft across all our regions as wireless carriers delay deployment of capital for such mobile test tools 
wts revenue for fiscal decreased compared to the prior fiscal year  underscoring the challenges of our wts business  which include a consolidating customer base comprised of a relatively small number of wireless carriers and 
table of contents equipment vendors  as well as uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of anticipated orders from this customer base 
additionally  we have experienced increased competition in our european region from swissqual and others 
we expect our ability to compete on a global basis to be driven by our ability to offer products that cover all current wireless technologies  as well as the timely integration of new technology and functionality into our product platform 
during fiscal  we entered into a cooperative alliance with ascom  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we have developed harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards 
these harmonized products and solutions are now available to the worldwide marketplace 
late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received a purchase order from at t valued at approximately million for the symphony multi system  jointly developed by ascom and comarco 
we began delivery on this order during the first quarter of fiscal  and expect to complete delivery during the first half of fiscal call box our call box business designs  manufactures  and maintains emergency call boxes 
our call boxes provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to call boxes  we provide installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  there are approximately  call boxes that we maintain under long term agreements that expire at various dates through january wireless carriers have begun reallocating spectrum away from analog  or first generation  wireless technologies to digital  or g and g  wireless technologies 
as a result  state and local governmental agencies are continuing to upgrade their existing call box systems to digital to maintain the functional efficiencies of their call box systems 
our upgraded call boxes are configured to accommodate g gsm and cdma wireless technologies 
during fiscal   and  we executed on multiple upgrade contracts 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our call box business during fiscal  we upgraded  call boxes from analog to digital and or text telephony tty technologies provided by wireless carriers and recorded revenue totaling approximately million 
this upgrade revenue also included revenue related to retrofit  site mitigation  and call box removal activities performed in conjunction with the upgrade of the call boxes 
during fiscal  we upgraded approximately  call boxes and recorded revenue totaling approximately million  which also included revenue related to retrofit  site mitigation activities  and call box removal activities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we were awarded a contract by kern county  california to upgrade their existing analog call box system  consisting of approximately units 
this contract is valued at approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of revenue and completed units 
we expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal  which includes site mitigation valued at million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we were awarded the amended contract to upgrade the call boxes owned by the riverside county safe  located in california  to digital and tty technologies 
this upgrade is valued at approximately million 
we began work during the fourth quarter of fiscal  recording revenue of million  and expect to complete the project during the first quarter of fiscal we anticipate a decline in call box revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal  as we expect to substantially complete the upgrade of the installed base by the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments 
all of our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe the following are the most significant and involve a higher degree of uncertainty  subjectivity  and judgments 
these policies involve estimates and judgments that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and judgments may significantly impact our annual and quarterly operating results 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
generally  our products are shipped fob named point of shipment  whether it is lake forest  our corporate headquarters  or hong kong  the shipping point of our chargesource products 
shipments to swissqual  our former exclusive wts distributor in europe  are shipped delivery duties unpaid ddu 
under ddu  title and risk of loss for the goods shipped passes to the buyer at destination 
our wts products are integrated with embedded software 
accordingly  we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element  typically maintenance  based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we amortize the revenue allocated to the maintenance element evenly over the term of the maintenance commitment made at the time of sale 
we expense as incurred the costs associated with honoring the maintenance commitment 
the revenue attributable to the delivered product is the residual amount after subtracting the revenue allocated to the undelivered element from the sales price 
the revenue attributable to the delivered product is recognized following the policy for product sales described above 
we recognize service revenue as the services are performed 
maintenance revenue from extended warranty sales is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically to month periods 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
for our wts business  management must make judgments  for example  regarding uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance because some orders may include acceptance test provisions that require we defer revenue upon shipment until such time as the client has accepted the equipment 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
stock based compensation effective february   the start of our fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and  therefore  have not revised prior periods results for the adoption of this accounting statement 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to be measured based on the award s fair value on the date of grant  and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes option pricing model is based on a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected forfeiture rates  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if the assumptions change  stock based compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
for fiscal year  stock based compensation was determined under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock based compensation plans 

table of contents software development costs we had million of gross capitalized software as of january   which has been fully amortized 
capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of revenue 
we capitalize software developed for sale or lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
technological feasibility is generally demonstrated by the completion of a working model 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products and expense the costs associated with new releases  which primarily consist of enhancements or increased functionality of software embedded in existing products 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project and in estimating the economic life of the related product 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to our customers 
each quarter we compare capitalized software development costs to our estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
we also continually evaluate the recoverability of software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts and establishes reserves for uncollectible receivables based upon specific identification of account balances that have indications of uncertainty of collection 
indications of uncertainty of collections may include the customer s inability to pay  customer dissatisfaction  or other factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on excess quantities on hand based upon historical and forecasted component usage 
as demonstrated during prior periods  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense in conjunction with the evaluation and measurement of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary timing differences result in the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on a net basis and included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess on a periodic basis the probability that our net deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered 
if after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence  a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance is provided with a corresponding charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are estimated to be more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any required valuation allowance 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of incurring cumulative losses for a three year period  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately million  or the entire deferred tax asset balance existing as of the beginning of fiscal this valuation allowance was established based on management s overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize  and hence  utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  carry forward temporary differences and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises 
due to the current and prior years operating losses  the adjusted net deferred tax assets remain fully reserved as of january  valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we no longer amortize goodwill from acquisitions  but continue to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of january   we had million of goodwill recorded in our audited consolidated balance sheet 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology applied to the particular unit 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  in accordance with accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprise wide basis to determine recoverability 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of january   and identified impairment related to our call box acquisition goodwill in the amount of million 
the impairment review is based upon a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenue and costs for the reporting units  as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if we fail to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur additional charges for impairment of goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives  we amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives and assess any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also annually review the useful lives of each of our intangible assets 
as of january   we had million of non goodwill acquired intangible assets recorded in intangible assets  which relates to intellectual property rights 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 

table of contents impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required

allocated corporate overhead consists of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our accounting and finance  human resources and benefits  and other administrative personnel  as well as professional fees  directors fees  and other costs and expenses attributable to being a public company 
these costs are typically allocated to our three businesses based on each business s percentage share of total company costs and expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  allocated corporate overhead doubled to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal in fiscal  allocated corporate overhead decreased by million or percent

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wts products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
in the event kensington or any other customers of our chargesource business are unable to perform due to their inability to take delivery of the ordered products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
such significant change would negatively impact our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
should the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products become unable to manufacture our chargesource products at the level currently anticipated  our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our consolidated financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as adjustments to both short term investments and the deferred compensation liability 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sale  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
