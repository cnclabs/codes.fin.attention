item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview repros therapeutics inc the company  rprx  or we  us or our  was organized on august  we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule drugs for major unmet medical needs 
we have a proven track record of efficient and rapid advancement of our therapeutic candidates through clinical development 
our current product pipeline includes proellex phase for the treatment of anemia associated with uterine fibroids phase for the chronic treatment of uterine fibroids phase for the treatment of endometriosis androxal planned phase b trial to treat men with aihh  with concomitant plasma glucose and lipid elevations planned phase b trial in men with low testosterone levels wanting to improve or maintain their fertility and or sperm function our lead drug  proellex  is a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and is being developed for the treatment of uterine fibroids  anemia associated with excessive menstrual bleeding relating to uterine fibroids  or anemia associated with uterine fibroids  and endometriosis 
during the first quarter of we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  for proellex for the new indication of anemia associated with uterine fibroids 
during the first quarter of we also initiated two patient registration phase pivotal clinical trials with proellex for this new indication  which will be conducted in approximately sites in the united states and in several sites outside the united states 
our goal is to file a new drug application  or nda  for this indication around year end during the first quarter of we also initiated two registration phase pivotal clinical trials with proellex for the chronic treatment of uterine fibroids and two open label safety studies 
we are also currently conducting a phase clinical trial with proellex for the treatment of endometriosis 
uterine fibroids  anemia associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis affect a significant number of women of childbearing age in the developed world 
there is no currently approved effective long term drug treatment for uterine fibroids or endometriosis 
in the united states alone   women per year undergo a hysterectomy as a result of severe uterine fibroids 
our second product candidate  androxal  is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound 
we intend to initiate two proof of concept phase b clinical trials with androxal in the second quarter of one of these clinical trials will be in men with adult onset idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  or aihh  with concomitant plasma glucose and lipid elevations  all of which are components of metabolic syndrome 
recent published studies in older men show a link of low testosterone with higher incidences of insulin resistance  diabetes and consequently mortality rates 
based on a retrospective review of our recently completed six month clinical trial with androxal for the treatment of low testosterone due to secondary hypogonadism  our findings showed that androxal therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mean glucose levels in men with a body mass index  or bmi  and glucose levels md dl  an outcome not seen in the placebo or androgel arms of this study 
androgel is the current leading therapy for testosterone replacement 
the second phase b androxal clinical trial will be in men of reproductive age with low testosterone levels who want to improve or maintain their fertility and or sperm function while being treated for low testosterone 
we believe androxal will be superior to the existing drugs used to normalize testosterone as only androxal has the property of restoring both luteinizing hormone  or lh  and follicle stimulating hormone  or fsh  levels 
lh and fsh are the pituitary hormones that stimulate testicular testosterone and sperm production  respectively 
according to the urology channel  recent estimates show that approximately million men in the united states experience testosterone deficiency 

table of contents we were previously developing androxal in the united states to treat testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism by restoring normal testosterone production in males with functional testes and diminished pituitary function  a common condition in the aging male 
based on a type c meeting held with the food and drug administration  or fda  on october  we believe we do not have a clear clinical path to develop androxal for this indication in the us at this time 
although we believe androxal could be developed outside of the us  due to the limited european market for this indication and our limited internal resources we do not intend to pursue approval outside of the us at this time 
we also continue to maintain our patent portfolio of our phentolamine based products for the treatment of sexual dysfunction 
we continue to try to create value from these assets in various ways which includes product out licensing 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received approximately million in net proceeds which we have used and intend to continue to use for the clinical development of proellex and androxal 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking  and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients  and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates 
we do  however  expect these costs to increase substantially in future periods as we continue later stage clinical trials  initiate new clinical trials for additional indications and seek to obtain regulatory approvals 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have not generated any substantial revenue from commercial sale of our current product candidates 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we  or a potential partner  complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
we cannot be certain when or if any of our current product candidates will ever generate cash flow 
as of december   the company had accumulated losses of million and had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded our activities to date primarily from equity financings and corporate collaborations 
based on our current planned clinical programs  we will need to raise additional capital by the fourth quarter of we believe we can secure additional cash resources through either the out licensing of proellex or through the sale of our equity securities 
we have prior experience under similar situations as the current situation  in raising funds from corporate alliances as well as equity financings 
our preference is to complete an appropriate licensing deal with proellex which we feel would be the least dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we believe that we will secure sufficient capital to continue our currently planned clinical programs without any significant delay or impact on such programs  assuming that the results of our current ongoing open label safety trial with proellex for the treatment of uterine fibroids and our us phase clinical trial with proellex for the treatment of endometriosis are favorable 
if the results of these trials are unfavorable  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining additional capital in amounts sufficient to continue to fund its operations through either the out licensing of proellex  the sale of equity securities  or other alternative sources of funding  which outcome would have a material adverse effect on the company 
therefore  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
it is possible that our current clinical trial activities will be more costly and take longer than we anticipate  accordingly  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be necessary prior to the time anticipated 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under our ticker symbol  rprx 
effective january   we voluntarily withdrew the listing of our common stock from nyse arca  inc  formerly the pacific exchange  in order to streamline administrative requirements and reduce expenses 
we are an accelerated filer and are subject to additional financial regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley  which requires us to include in this annual report a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
these additional activities have resulted in increased costs to us and will result in future increased costs as we maintain compliance with these requirements 
we have full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 

table of contents our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  and depend  among other factors  on our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the value of the tax asset associated with this accumulated deficit can be substantially diminished in value to us due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  among other things  on successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
investments trading securities management determines the appropriate classification of investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each subsequent balance sheet date 
securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
securities classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value 
gains and losses on trading securities  realized and unrealized  are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method 
any other securities are classified as available for sale 
at december  all securities were classified as trading securities 
our investments typically include corporate bonds and notes  euro dollar bonds  taxable auction securities and asset backed securities 
our policy is to require minimum credit ratings of a a and a p with maturities of up to three years  excluding taxable auction securities 
these securities are classified as trading securities and are valued in our financial statements at their fair value 
the average life of the investment portfolio  excluding taxable auction securities  may not exceed months 
capitalized patent costs we capitalize the cost associated with building our patent library for proellex and androxal 
as of december   other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of  patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over years  or the lesser of the legal or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent costs was  and zero in  and  respectively 
of the  in capitalized patents   related to patents for proellex and  related to androxal 
r d expense research and development  or r d  expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
stock based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans at december   the non employee directors stock option plan  or director plan and the stock option plan  or plan 
we account for our stock based compensation plans under fasb statement no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r generally requires the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
under 
table of contents sfas r  we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
we follow the expanded guidance in sfas r for the development of our assumptions used as inputs to the black scholes model 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
income tax estimates and patents actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows we have had losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an nol requires the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we review for the impairment of capitalized patent costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
we have determined that our capitalized patent costs are not impaired as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position that will partially defer the effective date of sfas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas on november   the fasb agreed to a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas for other non financial assets and liabilities 
earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we are assessing sfas no 
and have not determined yet the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this pronouncement permits entities to use the fair value method to measure certain financial assets and liabilities by electing an irrevocable option to use the fair value method at specified election dates 
after election of the option  subsequent changes in fair value would result in the recognition of unrealized gains or losses as period costs during the period the change occurred 
sfas no 
becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   with early adoption permitted 
however  entities may not retroactively apply the provisions of sfas no 
to fiscal years preceding the date of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
may have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas  business combinations 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
this statement further establishes principals and requirements for how the acquiring entity recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and the company cannot estimate any impact this statement may have on the company s results of operations or financial position as any potential business combinations after the implementation date are unknown 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for entities that consolidate a 
table of contents noncontrolling interest  sometimes called a minority interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   but is not expected to have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as the company does not currently consolidate any noncontrolling interest entities 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for increased to million as compared to  for interest income increased to million for as compared to  for the increase in interest income is primarily due to an increase in marketable securities as a result of the completion of our public offering on february  in which we received approximately million in net proceeds 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses include contracted research  regulatory affairs activities and general research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in as compared to million in the increased expenses for are primarily due to an increase in our clinical and preclinical activities of  an increase of  in consulting fees  an increase of  in personnel costs  and an increase in non cash stock option compensation expense of  partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing activities of  general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease in expenses is primarily due to a decrease of  in professional services

total revenues for decreased to  as compared to  for research and development grants for were zero as compared to  for which was the remaining amount under our small business innovative research  or sbir  grants 
interest income decreased to  for as compared to  for the decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower cash balances 
research and development expenses

r d expenses increased to million in as compared to million in the increased expenses for are primarily due to increased spending in our clinical development programs million for proellex and million for androxal  an increase of  in personnel costs  an increase in non cash stock option compensation expense of  and a  increase in consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses increased to million for as compared to million for the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase of  in non cash stock option compensation expense  an increase of  in professional services and an increase of  in costs associated with meeting the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from private placements and public offerings of equity securities and with funds received under collaborative agreements 
we completed a public offering on february  of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
our primary use of cash to date has been in operating activities to fund research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses 
we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the increase in cash balance as of december  as compared to december  is primarily due to the completion of our follow on public offering of  shares on february  in which we received approximately million in net proceeds 

table of contents excluding maturities and purchases of marketable securities  net cash of approximately million  million  and million was used in operating activities during   and  respectively 
the major uses of cash for operating activities during was to fund our clinical development programs and associated administrative costs  net of interest income  of million 
cash used in investing activities was  in primarily for investments in technology rights related to our proellex and androxal patent portfolios 
cash provided by financing activities in was approximately million relating to the follow on public offering of  shares on february  and the exercise of  stock options 
the company leases laboratory and office space  and equipment pursuant to leases accounted for as operating leases 
the lease for the company s laboratory and office space expires in june rental expense for the years ended december   and  was approximately   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases with original terms in excess of one year as of december   are as follows in thousands total we have had losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december  we had approximately million of nols for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits expired in the year due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code the value of this tax asset to us can be substantially diminished 
for additional information relating to our nols  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded our activities to date primarily from equity financings and corporate collaborations 
we will require substantial funds for research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to commence sales and marketing efforts if appropriate  if the fda or other regulatory approvals are obtained 
we believe that our existing capital resources under our current operating plan will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least september  there can be no assurance that changes in our current strategic plans or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of our products  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by development stage companies  the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the costs associated with any future collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing or other funding arrangements  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the success of our potential future sales and marketing programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting and defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions of our planned business  and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for our activities are based on certain assumptions  including the assumption that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sold at their current fair values million before september   that the development and regulatory approval of our products can be completed at projected costs  and that product approvals and introductions will be timely and successful 
there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans  acquisitions or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
to satisfy our capital requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds in the public or private capital markets 
we may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
there can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of such financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of holders of our common stock 
because of the above factors  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
cash  cash equivalents and investments were approximately million at december  these assets were primarily invested in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper with maturities of less than months  which are classified as trading securities 
we do not invest in derivative securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no significant gain or loss on any security is expected to be recognized in earnings due to the expected short holding period 
the company held million in taxable auction securities at december  since december  the company has sold  or has received a call for mandatory redemption of  its position in all taxable auction securities except for two securities  which are valued at million in the accompanying financial statements 
while each security had successful auctions subsequent to year end  in february auctions for both of these securities failed 
as a result of the failed auctions  the company will contractually receive a 
table of contents higher interest rate day libor  and day libor multiplied by  respectively during the related day auction period 
the company expects that it will be able to liquidate its position in these securities at par million total through a sale of the securities in future auctions or through the redemption of the securities by the counterparty within twelve months of december  accordingly  the company has classified these securities as current assets 
each of the two remaining taxable auction securities carry aaa ratings 
the company will continue to monitor the value and classification of its taxable auction securities each reporting period for a possible impairment if a decline in fair value occurs
