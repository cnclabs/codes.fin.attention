b financial information about business segments during the fourth quarter  we reorganized into three operating segments north american dispute and investigative services  north american business consulting services  and international consulting operations 
prior segment data has been restated to reflect the changes 
these segments are predominately defined by their geography but may include members from global teams 
the business is managed and resources are allocated on the basis of the three operating segments 
the north american dispute and investigative services segment provides a wide range of services to clients facing the challenges of disputes  litigation  forensic investigation  discovery  and regulatory compliance 
the clients of this segment are principally law firms  corporate general counsels  and corporate boards

services are sold principally through vertical industry practices 
the clients are principally c suite and corporate management  government entities  and law firms

certain unallocated expense amounts  related to specific reporting segments  have been excluded from the segment operating profit to be consistent with the information used by management to evaluate segment performance 

table of contents c narrative description of business overview we market our services directly to senior and mid level executives including corporate counsels  law firms  corporate boards  corporate executives and special committees 
we use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all segments 
our future performance will continue to depend upon the ability of our consultants to win new engagements as well as our ability to retain such consultants 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  an on site presence affords our consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
we derive our revenues primarily from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a substantial majority of our revenues are generated under rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
those incremental revenues may affect quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of training and recruiting the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits  and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs for corporate management and administrative personnel including finance  marketing  information technology and office support  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our office locations 
service offerings we provide wide and varied service offerings to our broad client base 
we consider the following to be our key professional services dispute  investigative  financial  operational and business advisory services  risk management and regulatory advisory services  and transaction advisory solutions services 
industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries and to the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the construction  energy  financial services  insurance and healthcare industries 
additionally  we have a strong client presence in the public sector  including federal  state and local governmental agencies 
we have a long history of work for defendants  insurers and reinsurers in product liability matters 
human capital as of december   we had  employees comprised of  consultants  project employees and administrative employees 
revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative 
table of contents and experienced professionals at all levels 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts to recruit professionals with significant subject matter expertise and or consulting experience 
consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
we try to retain our consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  and benefits 
independent contractors supplement our consultants on certain engagements 
we find that hiring independent contractors on a per engagement basis allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  we have acquired and seek to acquire consulting businesses to add highly skilled professionals  to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond termination 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation to include salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  and other cash and equity incentives from certain programs to ensure that it is competitive within the industry  is consistent with our performance  and provides us with the ability to achieve target profitability levels 
our compensation structure is reviewed and approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
our bill rates to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of the consulting staff 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates according to the supply and demand of the then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have greater personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
we believe that our independence  experience  reputation  industry focus  and broad range of professional services enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
d other matters concentration of revenues revenues earned from our top clients amounted to percent  percent and percent of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there were no clients that accounted for more than percent of our total revenues for the years ended december   and the mix of our largest clients may change from year to year 
non us operations we have offices in canada  asia  and the united kingdom 
in addition  we have clients based in the united states that have international operations 
the united kingdom accounted for percent of our revenue during the year ended december  no country  other than the united states and the united kingdom  accounted for more than percent of our total annual revenues in any of the three years ended december   and our non us subsidiaries  in aggregate  represented approximately percent  or million  of our total revenues in compared to percent  or million  in and less than percent for

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
such factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our inability to retain and  as necessary  strengthen our executive management team would be detrimental to the success of our business 
we rely heavily on a small group of senior executives and retaining their services is important to our future success 
as we continue to grow the business  the executive management team will face increasing challenges and the possible need to supplement or expand the existing team  as well as put in place a necessary succession plan 
any failures in this regard could impact  among other factors  our revenues  growth and profitability 
our inability to retain highly skilled consulting professionals could have a material adverse effect on our success 
we rely heavily on our consulting staff and management team 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense and our inability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants and managers could have a serious effect on our ability to meet client needs 
a loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious negative effect on us 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
our revenue  and thereby our profitability  is largely based on the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours our professionals work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  revenues  project profit margins and our profitability will suffer 
pricing 
table of contents pressures could result in changes in pricing policies and project profit margins 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate headcount without significant underutilized personnel  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources  and our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our growth strategies 
our use of equity based compensation could impact our ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
any significant volatility or sustained decline in the market price of our common stock or availability due to usage restrictions could impair our ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge 
we face significant challenges in achieving and managing growth 
failure to meet these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 
the increased scale and complexity of our businesses may require additional management systems that we may not be able to implement in a timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on our management team  management processes and our information technology systems 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair our financial results  competitive position and ability to retain our professionals 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on our business and the results of operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
nevertheless  even with adequate controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions 
the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
regulatory and legislative changes affecting us  our clients  competitors  or staff could have an impact on our business 
many of our clients are in highly regulated industries such as the healthcare  energy  financial institutions and insurance industries 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could impact the market for our service offerings and could render our service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
this change could either increase or decrease our position compared with our competitors 
our client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated 
our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on us 
we might not meet our current or future commitments if we do not continually secure new engagements 

table of contents many of the client engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
some of our work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
additionally  the above mentioned factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing  which can impact our financial results 
our client engagements and revenues are frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of and hurricane katrina 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing  which can impact our financial results 
we have invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which we may fail to recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have developed specialized systems and processes that provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of our service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
our intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were negligent or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we carry professional liability insurance  but our insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify higher risk engagements and higher risk clients in time to avoid unnecessary risks or to limit our potential exposure  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  expert witness engagements  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  
table of contents engagements where we deliver an actuarial opinion with respect to insurance company loss reserves  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of bond financings 
as we become larger  we increasingly encounter professional conflicts of interest 
as we become larger  the potential for conflicts of interest also increases 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including a conflict of interest  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations 
we may also have a hard time retaining such consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability 
our international operations create special risks 
we have offices in three countries outside the us and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue our international expansion  and our international revenues are expected to account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial and business risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  burdensome regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses 
if we are not able to quickly adapt to our new markets  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to consummate future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 
we maintain a million unsecured credit facility including a term loan agreement and a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
in addition  the current agreement may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business if a decline in financial performance occurs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to effect future acquisitions or to otherwise meet our working capital needs 
furthermore  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  we and our financial results would be adversely impacted  which could result in all of the effects described above 
we may not be able to acquire businesses in the future and already acquired businesses may not achieve expected results 
we have developed our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
there has been increasing competition for acquisition targets  as possible acquirers also seek to expand their businesses through acquisitions 
the increased competition may continue to make it more difficult for us to complete 
table of contents acquisitions or to complete acquisitions on as favorable terms as in the past 
those factors may also make it more difficult to achieve an acceptable return of our capital on certain business acquisitions 
the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire  which may adversely affect us 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could adversely affect our financial performance 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various municipal  state and federal entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to  the following government entities reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them  or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular government agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely affect our competitive position  failure to comply could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 
we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain related laws  which generally prohibit us companies from engaging in bribery of  or other prohibited payments to  foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
corruption  bribery  pay offs  and other fraudulent practices involving foreign officials occur from time to time in the markets in which we operate 
there is no assurance that employees and agents have not engaged and will not engage in misconduct for which we might be held responsible 
if our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe monetary penalties and other legal consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business  properties  prospects  financial conditions and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  corporate acquisitions  real estate and other business transactions 
the costs and outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and may be worse than we can foresee 
this could have a material adverse effect on us

item properties 
we have approximately operating leases for office facilities  principally in the united states

our revenues  margins and profits are generally not materially impacted by macro economic business trends  although a long term decline in the us economy would likely impact our business 
examples of impacting events are natural disasters  legislative and regulatory changes  capital market disruptions  crises in the energy  healthcare  financial services  insurance and other industries  and significant client specific events 
we derive our revenues primarily from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a substantial majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits  and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our primary offices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues as the related professional services are provided 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services 
the recording of these fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable  or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also earn 
table of contents incremental revenues 
these incremental revenue amounts are generally contingent on a specific event  and the incremental revenues are recognized when the contingencies are resolved 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
we test goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment 
this annual test is performed in the second quarter of each year by comparing the financial statement carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value 
we also review long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing and reviews may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization during the periods presented 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  employee training methodology and materials  backlog revenue and trade names 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption  ranging up to nine years 
share based payments we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  such as our stock option and restricted stock plans  in the financial statements based on their fair value 
we treat our employee stock purchase plan as compensatory and record the purchase discount from market price of stock purchases by employees as share based compensation expense 
management judgment is required in order to estimate the fair value of certain share based payments 
income taxes we account for deferred income taxes utilizing statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  as amended 
sfas requires an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
when appropriate  in accordance with sfas  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of fin requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risks relates to changes in interest rates associated with our borrowings under the line of credit  and our investment portfolio  classified as cash equivalents 
our general investment policy is to limit the risk of principal loss by limiting market and credit risks 
at december   our investments were primarily limited to a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank for a notional value of million through june  this agreement effectively fixed our libor base rate for million of our indebtedness at a rate of during this period 
we expect the interest rate derivative to be highly effective against changes in cash flows related to changes in interest rates and have recorded the derivative as a hedge 
as a result  gains or losses related to fluctuations in fair value of the interest rate derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense as the variable interest expense on our indebtedness is recorded 
there was no ineffectiveness related to this hedge for the year ended december  as of december   we had a million liability related to this interest rate derivative and recorded a million unrealized loss  net of a tax benefit of million  to accumulated other comprehensive income during other than the deferred purchase price obligations  notes payable  borrowings under the credit agreement  and the million interest rate swap agreement  we did not have  at december   any other short term debt  long term debt  interest rate derivatives  forward exchange agreements  firmly committed foreign currency sales transactions  or derivative commodity instruments 
our market risk associated with the credit agreement relates to changes in interest rates 
as of december   borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  in general  based at a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
based on borrowings under the credit agreement at december   each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a  change in annual interest expense  after considering the impact of our interest rate swap agreement entered into on july  we operate in foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the united kingdom pounds sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively
