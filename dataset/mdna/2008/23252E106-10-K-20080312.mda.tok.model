based on this reevaluation  we reduced the valuation allowance by  effective july  we further reduced the valuation allowance by  in during the period from the establishment of the valuation allowance in  to the july  reduction of the valuation allowance  our income tax provision was limited to state taxes and federal alternative minimum taxes 
the effective tax rate excluding changes in the valuation allowance was in subsequent to july  and in actual cash outlays for taxes  however  continue to be reduced by the available operating loss carryforwards  consistent with prior periods

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to operating cash flows which were used to finance higher inventory balances of the new t and vr and the outsourcing of parts

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserves for warranty obligations  reserves for legal matters and product liability  recoverability of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
all products are warranted for up to three years for labor and up to ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to ten years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from management s estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company will record a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no loss is recorded 
as additional information becomes available  the company will continue to assess whether losses from legal matters are probable  possible  or remote  and the adequacy of accruals for probable loss contingencies 
product liability reserve 
due to the nature of its products  the company is involved in certain pending product liability claims and lawsuits 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage subject to deductibles 
reserves for self insured retention  including claims incurred but not yet reported  are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  based on management s review of outstanding claims and claims history and consultation with its third party claims administrators 
if actual results vary from management s estimates  adjustments to the reserve would be required 
recoverability of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  management is required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the fair value of the business supports the carrying value of goodwill and net operating assets 
this analysis includes assumptions and estimates about future sales  costs  working capital  capital expenditures  and cost of capital 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
in  the company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
effective july   management reevaluated the need for this valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  due to the existence of various factors 
based on this reevaluation  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  effective july  as part of its quarterly process to reevaluate the need for this valuation allowance  effective september  the company further reduced the valuation allowance by  the net deferred tax asset balance of  at december  represents the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized and the remaining valuation allowance at december  is  management will continue to assess the need for the remaining valuation allowance in future periods 
approximately  of income before income taxes is needed to fully realize the company s recorded net deferred tax asset and  of future taxable income is needed to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions relating to the likely utilization of the deferred tax asset change in the future  the valuation allowance may change accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio as of december  is comprised of variable rate debt denominated in us dollars 
changes in interest rates have an impact on the variable portion of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the company s consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company had variable rate debt with a carrying value of  a basis point change in interest rates would have impacted interest expense by  for the year ended december  the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes and also to reduce volatility of its financing costs 
under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on agreed notational principal amounts 
these agreements are considered highly effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of the company s variable debt  and hedge accounting is used to account for these instruments 
included in the variable rate debt is the wachovia term loan  for which the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective march   which effectively converts the rate from a floating rate based on libor to a fixed rate throughout the duration of the swap agreement 
the company also has an interest rate swap which effectively converts the citizens real estate loan in the amount of  at december  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of throughout the duration of the loan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these instruments 
foreign currency rates the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on sales made in the uk in british sterling 
at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts of  british sterling for the purchase of
