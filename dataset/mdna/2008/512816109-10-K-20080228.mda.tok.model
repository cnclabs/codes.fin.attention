lamar advertising company the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview the company s net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the company 
the company relies on sales of advertising space for its revenues  and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  which affect the rates that the company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales on its displays 
since december   the company has increased the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates by approximately by completing strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising and transit assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  which included the issuance of  shares of lamar advertising company class a common stock valued at the time of issuance at approximately million 
the company has financed its recent acquisitions and intends to finance its future acquisition activity from available cash  borrowings under its bank credit agreement and the issuance of class a common stock 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
as a result of acquisitions  the operating performances of individual markets and of the company as a whole are not necessarily comparable on a year to year basis 
the acquisitions completed during the year ended december  were in existing markets and have caused no material integration issues 
the company expects to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement the company s business 
growth of the company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays  logo sign and transit contracts  and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to long lived asset recovery  intangible assets  goodwill impairment  deferred taxes  asset retirement obligations and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events and  where applicable  established valuation techniques 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
long lived asset recovery 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
property  plant and equipment of billion and intangible assets of million are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset before interest expense 
these undiscounted cash flow projections are based on management assumptions surrounding future operating results and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangible assets may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
no such impairment charge has been recorded by the company 
intangible assets 
the company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet 
intangible assets primarily represent site locations of million and customer relationships of million associated with the company s acquisitions 
the fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results  including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates  of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the company s intangible assets 
goodwill impairment 
the company had goodwill of billion as of december  and must perform an impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this analysis requires management to make assumptions as to the implied fair value of its reporting unit as compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
in conducting the impairment analysis  the company determines the implied fair value of its reporting unit utilizing quoted market prices of its class a common stock  which are used to calculate the company s enterprise value as compared to the carrying value of the company s assets 
discounted cash flow models before interest expense are also used 
these discounted cash flow models require management to make assumptions including projecting the company s net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates related to the future operating results of the company and the anticipated future economic environment 
based upon the company s annual review as of december   no impairment charge was required 

table of contents deferred taxes 
as of december   the company determined that its deferred tax assets of million  a component of which is the company s net operating loss carry forward  are fully realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities of approximately million that are anticipated to reverse during the carry forward period 
the company bases this determination by projecting taxable income over the relevant period 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
for a more detailed description  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of million as of december  as a result of its adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  this liability relates to the company s obligation upon the termination or non renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition 
the company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which they are incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
in calculating the liability  the company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle  adjusted for inflation and market risk 
this calculation includes of the company s billboard structures on leased land which currently consist of approximately  structures 
the company uses a year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets  including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets  which includes the initial term of the lease  plus any renewal period 
historical third party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on credit rates historically available to the company 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r share based payments sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  restricted stock and performance shares  under the modified prospective transition method 
share based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
sfas no 
r requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the company has elected to use the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected life is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
during  we recorded million as compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases 
we evaluate and adjust our assumptions on an annual basis 
see note stock compensation plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based on the payment patterns of its customers 
management analyzes historical results  the economic environment  changes in the credit worthiness of its customers  and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of the company s allowance 
bad debt expense was million  million and million or approximately of net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if the future economic environment declines  the inability of customers to pay may occur and the allowance for doubtful accounts may need to be increased  which will result in additional bad debt expense in future years 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which changes how business acquisitions are accounted 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets  and tax benefits 
for the company  sfas no 
r 
table of contents is effective for business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december  the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and disclosures of this standard 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in earnings 
statement is effective as of january  the company does not expect any material financial statement implications relating to the adoptions of this statement 
in september  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of statement will change current practice 
statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within these fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued staff positions no 
and no 
which partially defer the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we are assessing the impact of statement  which we do not expect to have an impact on our financial position  results or operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lamar advertising company and lamar media corp 
lamar advertising company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary lamar media corp 
the information below summarizes the company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december   and should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
loans under lamar media corp 
s bank credit agreement bear interest at variable rates equal to the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor plus the applicable margin 
because the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor may increase or decrease at any time  the company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the bank credit agreement 
increases in the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the bank credit agreement would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the company s net income 
at december  there was approximately billion of aggregate indebtedness outstanding under the bank credit facility  or approximately of the company s outstanding long term debt on that date  bearing interest at variable rates 
the aggregate interest expense for with respect to borrowings under the bank credit agreement was million  and the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under this credit facility during was 
assuming that the weighted average interest rate was basis points higher that is rather than  then the company s interest expense would have been approximately million higher resulting in a million decrease in the company s net income 
the company has mitigated the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate long term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
in addition  the company has the capability under the bank credit agreement to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to libor plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months  which would allow the company to mitigate the impact of short term fluctuations in market interest rates 
in the event of an increase in interest rates  the company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure 
the company cannot guarantee  however  that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or that  if these actions are taken  that they will be effective
