results of operations overview our primary business objective is to generate income while preserving principal by investing in real estate loans 
we believe there is a significant market opportunity to make real estate loans to owners and developers of real property whose financing needs are not met by other real estate lenders 
the loan underwriting standards utilized by our manager and vestin originations are less strict than those used by many institutional real estate lenders 
in addition  one of our competitive advantages is our ability to approve loan applications more quickly than many institutional lenders 
as a result  in certain cases  we may make real estate loans that are riskier than real estate loans made by many institutional lenders such as commercial banks 
however  in return  we seek a higher interest rate and our manager takes steps to mitigate the lending risks such as imposing a lower loan to value ratio 
while we may assume more risk than many institutional real estate lenders  in return  we seek to generate higher yields from our real estate loans 
our operating results are affected primarily by i the amount of capital we have to invest in real estate loans  ii the level of real estate lending activity in the markets we service  iii our ability to identify and work with suitable borrowers  iv the interest rates we are able to charge on our loans and v the level of non performing assets  foreclosures and related loan losses which we may experience 
our capital  subject to a reserve  will constitute the bulk of the funds we have available for investment in real estate loans 
we do not have any arrangements in place  except for the funds we received pursuant to the vct i closing  to materially increase the funds we will have available to invest from any other sources 
see discussion under capital and liquidity 
on june   we completed the issuance of million in unsecured trust preferred securities through the special purpose business trust  vct i to merrill lynch international  bear stearns co 
inc and taberna funding llc 
the proceeds derived from the sale of these securities will increase the capital we have available to invest 
these securities have a fixed interest rate equal to through july  and thereafter are subject to a variable rate equal to libor plus per annum  resetting quarterly 
the securities mature on july  and may be called at par by the company any time after july  these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
we are obligated to pay the trust preferred securities with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  redemption or repayment 
our operating results during the past several years have been adversely affected by increases in allowances for loan losses 
at december   the following loans were non performing based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the payment of interest is days past due  rightstar  inc part i part ii  monterrey associates lp  forest development llc  pirates lake  ltd  jeffrey s court  llc  v m homes at the palms  inc and brawley ca  llc 
these loans are currently carried on our books at a value of approximately million  net of allowance for loan losses of approximately million  which does not include the allowances of approximately million relating to the decrease in the property value for performing loans as of december  these loans have been placed on non accrual of interest status and are the subject of pending foreclosure proceedings
