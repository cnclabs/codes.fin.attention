sop requires impaired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of sop under sop  the excess cash flows expected at purchase over the purchase price is recorded as interest income over the life of the loan 
for loan portfolios acquired prior to january   firstcity designated such loans as non performing portfolio assets or performing portfolio assets 
such designation was made at the acquisition of the pool and does not change even though the actual performance of the loans may change 
firstcity accounts for all nonperforming loans acquired after in accordance with sop the following is a description of each classification and the related accounting policy accorded to each portfolio type loans acquired prior to non performing portfolio assets non performing portfolio assets consist primarily of distressed loans and loan related assets  such as foreclosed upon collateral 
accounting for non performing portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
prior to january   portfolio assets were designated as non performing if a majority of all of the loans in the portfolio were significantly under performing in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements at the date of acquisition 
net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets is recognized as income to the extent that 
table of contents proceeds collected exceed a pro rata portion of allocated cost from the pool 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual proceeds divided by total estimated proceeds of the pool 
no interest income is recognized separately on non performing portfolio assets 
all proceeds  of whatever type  are included in income from portfolio assets in determining the gain on resolution of such assets 
accounting for non performing portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
all non performing portfolio assets are purchased at discounts from their outstanding legal principal amount  the total of the aggregate of expected future sales prices and the total payments to be received from obligors 
subsequent to acquisition  the adjusted cost of non performing portfolio assets is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  which represents the net realizable value of the non performing pool 
once it is determined that there is impairment  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the actual future proceeds of the pool could vary materially from the estimated proceeds of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  deterioration of collateral values  deterioration in the borrower s financial condition and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future proceeds of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets 
in the event that actual future proceeds of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in lower net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool 
performing portfolio assets performing portfolio assets consist primarily of portfolios of loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate amount of the borrowers obligation 
prior to january   performing portfolio assets were accounted for using the interest method acquisition discounts for the portfolio as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the portfolio 
performing portfolio assets are carried at the unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans  net of acquisition discounts and allowance for loan losses 
significant increases in expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the internal rate of return irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
income on performing portfolio assets is accrued monthly based on each loan pool s effective irr 
cash flows greater than the interest accrual will reduce the carrying value of the pool 
likewise  cash flows that are less than the accrual will increase the carrying balance 
the irr is estimated and periodically recalculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection model 
gains are recognized on the performing portfolio assets when sufficient funds are received to fully satisfy the obligation on loans included in the pool  either from funds from the borrower or sale of the loan 
the gain recognized represents the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the individual loan in the pool 

table of contents the actual future cash flows of the pool could vary materially from the expected future cash flows of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  changes in collateral values  deterioration in the borrowers financial condition  restructure or renewal of individual loans in the pool  sale of loans within the pool and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future cash flows of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher level of interest income due to greater amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from the performing portfolio assets as well as higher gains recognized on the sale of individual loans from a pool 
in the event that actual future cash flows of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in a lower level of interest income and reduced gains from the sale of assets from a pool  lower levels of interest income as a result of lower amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool due to a decline in the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of loans acquired prior to management s best estimate of irr as of january   is the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
if it is probable that all cash flows estimated at acquisition plus any changes to expected cash flows arising from changes in estimates after acquisition would not be collected  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
prior to january   impairment charges would be taken to the income statement with a corresponding write off of the receivable balance 
consequently  no allowance for loan loss was recorded prior to january  the company recorded net impairment provisions of  in   in and  in a pool can become fully amortized zero carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as revenue when received 
additionally  the company uses the cost recovery method when timing and amount of collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the portfolio  or until such time that the company considers the collections to be probable and estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
loans acquired after loans acquired with credit deterioration at acquisition  firstcity reviews each loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that firstcity will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  firstcity determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics including loan type  collateral type  geographical location  performance status and borrower relationship 
firstcity considers expected prepayments  and estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows expected at acquisition for each loan and each subsequently aggregated pool of loans 
firstcity determines the excess of the loan s or pool s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over all cash flows expected at acquisition as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the loan s cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment in the loan or pool is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool accretable yield 
over the life of the loan or pool  firstcity continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
firstcity evaluates at the balance sheet date whether the present value of its loans 
table of contents determined using the effective interest rates has decreased below book value and if so  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the present value of any subsequent increase in the loan s or pool s actual cash flows or cash flows expected to be collected is used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increases in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected will be used to recalculate the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for all acquired loans subject to sop to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition that are not expected to be collected 
the company recorded net impairment provisions of million in   in  and none in on these loans 
loans acquired with no credit deterioration loans acquired without evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition for which firstcity has the positive intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and reported at their unpaid principal balance net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums 
interest accrual ceases when payments become days contractually past due 
an allowance for loan losses is established when a loan becomes impaired 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the company recorded net impairment provisions of  in   in  and  in on these loans 
real estate portfolios real estate portfolios consist of real estate acquired from a variety of sellers 
such portfolios are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
costs relating to the development and improvement of real estate for its intended use are capitalized  whereas those relating to holding assets are charged to expense 
income or loss is recognized upon the disposal of the real estate 
rental income  net of expenses  on real estate portfolios is recognized when received 
accounting for the portfolios is on an individual asset by asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
subsequent to acquisition  the amortized cost of real estate portfolios is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  net of costs to sell  which represents the net realizable value of the real estate portfolio 
impairment losses are charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded net impairment losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
loans receivable loans receivable consist of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and non affiliated entities  and purchased and originated sba loans 
the repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral ie loan pools  and distributions made from affiliated entities 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
loan origination fees and costs as well as premiums and discounts are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms 
unamortized net fees or costs are recognized upon early repayment of the loans 

table of contents the company evaluates all loans receivable for impairment on regular basis by reviewing the collectibility of the loans in light of various factors  as applicable  such as estimated future cash receipts of the borrower or underlying collateral  historical experience  estimated value of underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and industry concentrations 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired if it is probable that the company will not ultimately collect all principal or interest amounts contractually due 
loans that experience insignificant payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income and the company ceases to accrue interest on the note 
when ultimate collectibility of the impaired note is in doubt  all cash receipts are generally applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered  and are recognized as interest income thereafter 
impairment losses are charged against an allowance account through provisions charged to operations in the period impairment is identified 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
deferred tax asset as a part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves calculating the company s current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or changes in tax rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets  if any  is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
as a result of the merger  the company has substantial federal nols that can be used to offset the tax liability associated with the company s pre tax earnings until the earlier of the expiration or utilization of such nols 
the company accounts for the benefit of the nols by recording the benefit as an asset and then establishing an allowance to value the net deferred tax asset at a value commensurate with the company s expectation of being able to utilize the recognized benefit in the foreseeable future 
such estimates are reevaluated on a quarterly basis with the adjustment to the allowance recorded as an adjustment to the income tax expense generated by the quarterly operating results 
significant events that change the company s view of its currently estimated ability to utilize the tax benefits result in substantial changes to the estimated allowance required to value the deferred tax benefits recognized in the company s periodic consolidated financial statements 
the company s analysis resulted in no change in  and the company has a net deferred tax asset of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which is composed of a gross deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of the resulting net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income from its continuing operations prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax asset  net of the allowance  will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change 
the ability of the company to realize the 
table of contents deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly

risk factors 
equity investments in acquisition partnerships firstcity accounts for its investments in acquisition partnerships and their general partners using the equity method of accounting 
this accounting method generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings from the partnerships activities as if it had a direct investment in the underlying portfolio assets held by the partnerships 
the revenues and earnings of the partnerships are determined on a basis consistent with the accounting methodology applied to portfolio assets as described in the preceding paragraphs 
firstcity has ownership interests in the various partnerships that range from to 
the company also holds investments in servicing entities that are accounted for under the equity method 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 
generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are comprised of two components previously reported as the company s residential and commercial mortgage banking business and the consumer lending business conducted through firstcity s minority interest investment in drive 
in november  firstcity completed the sale of its interest in drive  and as of december   the company had zero assets remaining from the discontinued consumer operations  but certain income realized from such operations 
the only asset remaining from discontinued mortgage operations is an investment security resulting from the retention of a residual interest in a securitization transaction 
this security is in run off  and the company is contractually obligated to service this asset 
prior to the fourth quarter of  firstcity classified these securities as held to maturity and considered the estimated future gross cash receipts for such investment securities in the computation of the value of such investment securities 
in the fourth quarter of  firstcity s management elected to pursue a strategy to liquidate these assets and carry them as held for sale 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the remaining security is recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the cash flows are collected over a period of time and are valued using a discount rate of and prepayment assumptions of for fixed rate loans and for variable rate loans 
overall loss rates are estimated at of collateral 
the assumptions used in the valuation model consider both industry as well as the company s historical experience and are reviewed quarterly in light of historical evidence in revising the prospective results of the model 
these revised assumptions could potentially result in either an increase or decrease in the estimated cash receipts 
an additional provision is booked based on the output of the valuation model if deemed necessary 
the company recorded no provisions in   in and  in for additional losses from discontinued mortgage operations 
the provision in primarily related to a decrease in the estimated future gross cash receipts on residual interests in securitizations as a result of the actual losses exceeding the losses projected by the valuation model 

table of contents estimates of future cash receipts the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from acquired portfolio asset pools are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of sales of non performing portfolios  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in a pool of portfolio assets 
calculation of the estimates of future cash receipts the company uses a proprietary asset management software program to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset and the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
risks associated with these estimates the company has in the past been able to establish with reasonable accuracy the estimated future cash receipts over the life of a purchased asset pool 
changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  deterioration of collateral values  and other factors described in the risk factors section could cause the estimates of future cash flows to be materially different than actual cash receipts 
the effects of an increase in the estimated future cash receipts would generally increase revenues from portfolio assets by increasing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and increasing the effective yield on a performing or sop portfolio while a decrease in future cash receipts would generally have the effect of reducing revenues by reducing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and creating impairment on a performing or sop portfolio 
in some cases a reduction in the total future cash receipts by collecting those cash receipts sooner than expected could have a positive impact on the company s revenues from portfolio assets due to reduced interest expense and other carrying costs associated with the portfolio assets 
likewise an increase in future cash receipts  although generally a positive trend  could have a negative impact on future revenues of the company if collected over a longer period  resulting in higher levels of interest expense and other carrying costs of the portfolios negating any potentially positive effects 
consolidation policy in addition to consolidating entities in which firstcity has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest  firstcity evaluates the consolidation of entities to which common conditions of consolidation  such as voting interests and board representation  do not apply 
firstcity performs this evaluation pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r provides that  in the absence of clear control through voting interests  board representation or similar rights  a company s exposure  or variable interest  to the economic risks and potential rewards associated with its interest in the entity is the best evidence of control 
in connection with fin r  when evaluating an entity for consolidation  firstcity first determines whether an entity is within the scope of fin r and if it is deemed to be a variable interest entity vie 
if the entity is considered to be a vie  firstcity determines whether it would be considered the entity s primary beneficiary 
firstcity consolidates those vies for which it has determined that it is

generally  firstcity will consolidate an entity not deemed either a vie upon a determination that its ownership  direct or indirect  exceeds fifty percent of the outstanding voting shares of an entity and or that it has the ability to control the financial or operating policies through its voting rights  board representation or other similar rights 
for entities where firstcity does not have a controlling interest financial or operating  the investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity

sfas 
sfas requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in specified situations 
such servicing assets or liabilities would be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  and subsequently measured at amortized value or fair value based upon an election of the reporting entity 
sfas also specifies certain financial statement presentations and disclosures in connection with servicing assets and liabilities 
the company elected to measure the servicing assets  subsequent to the date of sale  by using the amortization method which amortizes servicing assets in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assesses servicing assets for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date 
the adoption of sfas by the company on january  did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s operations are materially impacted by net gains on sales of loans and net interest margins 
the level of gains from loan sales the company achieves is dependent on demand for the products originated 
net interest margins are dependent on the company s ability to maintain the spread or interest differential between the interest it charges the customer for loans and the interest the company is charged for the financing of those loans 
the following describes each component of interest bearing assets held by the company and how each could be affected by changes in interest rates 
the company invests in portfolio assets both directly through consolidated subsidiaries and indirectly through equity investments in acquisition partnerships 
portfolio assets consist of investments in pools of non homogenous assets that predominantly consist of loan and real estate assets 
earnings from these assets are based on the estimated future cash flows from such assets and recorded when those cash flows occur 
the underlying loans within these pools bear both fixed and variable rates 
due to the non performing nature and history of these loans  changes in prevailing benchmark rates such as the prime rate or libor generally have a nominal effect on the ultimate future cash flow to be realized from the portfolio assets 
loans receivable consist of investment loans made to acquisition partnerships and other unrelated entities  and bear interest at predominately fixed rates 
the collectibility of these loans is directly related to the underlying portfolio assets of those acquisition partnerships  which are non performing in nature 
therefore  changes in benchmark rates would have minimal effect on the collectibility of these loans 
sba loans receivable were million at december   of which million were related to the guaranteed portion of these loans 
the guaranteed portion is backed by the full faith and credit of the us small business administration  and is generally sold into the secondary market 
virtually all of the sba loans have variable interest rates 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have a minimal effect on interest income from sba loans for although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect a net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
firstcity had million in debt outstanding at december  the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its variable rate debt  which totaled million or of the company s total debt 
a basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease firstcity s annual interest expense by approximately million annually 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company currently has loans and equity investments in europe  latin america ie mexico  argentina  dominican republic and chile and canada 
in europe and in mexico  the company s investments are primarily in the form of equity and represent a significant portion of the company s total equity investments 
as previously discussed  the revolving acquisition facility with bank of scotland for million allows loans to be made in euros up to a maximum amount in euros that is equivalent to million us dollars 
at december   the company had million in euro denominated debt for the purpose of hedging a portion of the net equity investments in europe 
in november the company acquired a line of credit facility with banco santander  sa that allows loans to be made in mexican pesos up to a maximum of  mexican pesos 
at december   the company had  in mexican peso denominated debt  which was equivalent to million us dollars 
management of the company feels that these loan agreements will help reduce the risk of adverse effects of currency changes on these investments 
a sharp change in the foreign currencies related to the investments in europe  latin america and canada relative to the us dollar could materially adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
a and incremental depreciation of these currencies would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s foreign investments and are indicated in the following table 
these amounts are estimates  consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
estimated decline in valuation of investments resulting from incremental depreciation of foreign currency of dollars in thousands one us dollar equals europe eur mexico mxn argentina ars dominican republic dop chile clp canada cad
