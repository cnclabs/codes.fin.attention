critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments

assets held for sale assets are classified as held for sale when the company has committed to selling the asset and believes that it will be disposed of within one year 
the company determines the fair value  net of costs of disposal  of an asset on the date the asset is categorized as held for sale  and the asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value on that date 
the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company has two parcels of land held for sale at december  the fair value of these properties is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of these assets could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
the company estimates the two parcels of land that were held for sale at december   have an aggregate fair value  net of costs of disposal  that exceeds the carrying value of million 
one of the remaining parcels of land was sold in the first quarter of fiscal at an amount that exceeded its carrying value 
the amount the company will ultimately realize on the remaining parcel of land could differ materially from this estimate 
lease accounting the company determines whether to account for its leases as either operating  capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of the lease agreement 
this determination of classification is complex and requires significant judgment relating to certain information including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community  the company s cost of funds  minimum lease payments and other lease terms 
as of december   the company leased communities and classified each of the leases as an operating lease 
the company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the lease agreement

the amortization of the deferred gains is included in gain on sale of assets in the statement of operations 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are to years for buildings and building improvements  to years for leasehold improvements  to years for land improvements and to years for furniture  equipment and automobiles 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed 
the company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset  including contract changes  local market developments  and other publicly available information 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company analyzed certain long lived assets with operating losses  under the undiscounted cash flow method  for impairment 
based on this analysis the company does not believe there are any indicators that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of december  and income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provision of sfas no

management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance  if considered necessary  based on such evaluation 
while the company currently has a cumulative three year loss of million  it has evaluated future expectations of net income  based upon the last six quarters of profitability  including prospects to realize net gains on the company s appreciated assets 
however  the benefits of the net deferred tax asset might not be realized if there are future operating losses that exceed the anticipated gains on the company s appreciated assets or if the value of the appreciated assets decline in the future 
the company believes based upon this analysis that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is reasonably assured and therefore has not provided for a valuation allowance
