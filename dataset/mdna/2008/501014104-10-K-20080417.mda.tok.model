item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
company overview krispy kreme is a leading branded retailer and wholesaler of high quality doughnuts 
the company s principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme doughnut stores at which over varieties of high quality doughnuts  including the company s signature hot original glazed doughnut  are made  sold and distributed together with complementary products  and where a broad array of coffees and other beverages are offered 
the company s stores include factory stores and satellite stores 
factory stores have a doughnut making production line and are versatile in that many supply multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales 
sales to customers visiting company and franchise factory and satellite stores  including sales made through drive through windows  along with discounted sales to community organizations that in turn sell doughnuts for fundraising purposes 
off premises sales 
daily sales of fresh doughnuts primarily on a branded basis to a variety of retail customers  such as convenience stores  grocery stores mass merchants and other food service and institutional accounts 
doughnuts are sold to these customers on trays for display and sale in glass enclosed cases and in packages for display and sale on both stand alone display units and on customers shelves 
traditional factory stores have the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
commissaries  which are production facilities used principally to serve off premises customers domestically and to supplement factory stores focused on on premises sales internationally  have the highest production capacities of factory stores 
as of february   there were commissaries systemwide  six of which were operated by the company 
other factory stores often engage in both on premises and off premises sales  with the allocation between such channels dependent on the particular capacity of the store and the characteristics of the markets in which the stores operate 
each factory store has significant fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly affected by doughnut production volume and sales 
as of february   there were krispy kreme factory stores systemwide  consisting of company stores and franchise stores 
satellite stores consist primarily of the hot shop  fresh shop and kiosk formats 
the company has begun introducing hot shops  which utilize tunnel oven doughnut heating and finishing technology scaled to accommodate principally on premises sales in a store approximately one half the size of a traditional factory store 
hot shop technology allows customers to have a hot doughnut experience throughout the day 
fresh shops and free standing kiosks are satellite stores that do not contain doughnut heating technology  and are substantially smaller than a traditional factory store 
in each of these three formats  the company typically sells fresh doughnuts and beverages  with the doughnuts supplied by nearby factory stores 
as of february   hot shops  fresh shops and kiosks were open systemwide  the company operated five of those hot shops and three of those fresh shops 
the company views the hot shop  fresh shop and kiosk formats as additional ways to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
the company is working to refine its domestic store operating model to focus on a hub and spoke system  under which multiple satellite stores in a market are provided doughnuts from a single traditional factory store or commissary at which all doughnut production for the market takes place 
the objectives of the hub and spoke model are to  among other things reduce the investment required to produce a given level of sales and reduce operating costs by operating smaller satellite stores instead of larger  more expensive factory stores  achieve greater production efficiencies by centralizing doughnut production to minimize the burden of fixed costs  achieve greater consistency of product quality through a reduction in the number of doughnut making locations  enable store employees to focus on achieving excellence in customer satisfaction and in shop consumer experience  and stimulate an increase in on premises sales of doughnuts and complementary products by increasing the number of retail distribution points to provide customers more convenient access to the company s products 
because the hub and spoke concept has not been completely refined  the company does not expect that the company or its franchisees will open a significant number of domestic factory stores in the near future 
the company has converted several of its traditional factory stores to hot shops using tunnel oven technology to reduce operating costs and increase the number of hours each day the stores offer the company s hot original glazed doughnuts 
certain franchisees also have converted factory stores to hot shops 
the company plans to convert additional factory stores to hot shops in fiscal  and to begin construction of a limited number of satellite locations in order to continue development and demonstrate the operation of the hub and spoke concept 
in addition  the company is developing a strategy to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeast 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
because the company has not completed the development of its detailed refranchising plans and has not entered into any new domestic franchise agreements in several years  the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any such markets or the amount of any proceeds which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreements 
refranchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets 
like other retail and restaurant companies  the company constantly evaluates the performance of its stores and from time to time decides to close locations whose performance no longer meets company standards 
markets outside the united states are a source of growth 
as of february   there were a total of krispy kreme stores including satellites operated internationally  which were located in australia  canada  hong kong  indonesia  japan  kuwait  mexico  the philippines  qatar  saudi arabia  south korea  the united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
the company owned five of the canadian stores and had an equity interest in the franchisees operating stores in mexico and western canada 
the company currently does not expect to own equity interests in international area developers formed in the future 
based on continued research and experience with international stores  the company is focusing international development efforts primarily on opportunities in markets in asia and the middle east 
the development and franchise agreements for territories outside the united states which include the countries listed above provide for the development of over additional stores in fiscal and thereafter 
the company is vertically integrated to help maintain the consistency and quality of products throughout the krispy kreme system 
in addition  through vertical integration  the company utilizes volume buying power  which the company believes helps lower the cost of supplies to stores and enhances profitability 
the supply chain business unit  kk supply chain  produces doughnut mixes and manufactures doughnut making equipment  which all factory stores are required to purchase 
additionally  this business unit operates two distribution centers that are capable of supplying domestic stores and certain international stores with key supplies 
this business unit is volume driven  and its economics are enhanced by the opening of new stores and the growth of sales by existing stores 
the company has three reportable segments as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  as described below 
company stores 
the company stores segment is comprised of the operating activities of the stores operated by the company 
these stores sell doughnuts and complementary products through the sales channels described above under company overview 
expenses for this business segment include store level expenses along with direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
franchise 
the franchise segment consists of the company s store franchise operations 
the company has two principal franchise programs the associate program  which is the company s original franchising program developed in the s  and the area developer program  which was developed in the mid s 
associates generally pay royalties of of on premises sales and of all other sales 
area developers typically pay royalties of to of all sales and one time development and franchise fees ranging from  to  per store 
the company has informed its area developers that it will reduce the royalty rate on off premises sales to in fiscal domestic area developers are required to contribute of their sales to the brand fund 
international area developers generally are required to contribute of their sales to the brand fund 
some associates contribute of their sales to the brand fund 
the company is reducing  for an indefinite period  the brand fund contribution rate for domestic area developers and for participating associates to effective at the beginning of fiscal expenses for this business segment include costs incurred to recruit new franchisees  to assist with store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of these stores  as well as direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
kk supply chain 
the kk supply chain segment buys and processes ingredients it uses to produce doughnut mixes and manufactures doughnut making equipment that all factory stores are required to purchase 
the kk supply chain segment also purchases and sells key supplies  including icings and fillings  other food ingredients  juices  signage  display cases  uniforms and other items 
in october  the company ceased production at its coffee roasting facility and sold its coffee roasting assets  and simultaneously entered into an agreement with the purchaser to supply the company s coffee needs 
all intersegment sales from the kk supply chain segment to the company stores segment have been eliminated in consolidation 
expenses for this business unit include all expenses incurred at the manufacturing and distribution level along with direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
the ftc s trade regulation rule on franchising ftc rule and certain state and foreign laws require the company to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise disclosure document containing information prescribed by the ftc rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations 
the company has amended its franchise disclosure document fdd to conform it to new ftc disclosure requirements  and has submitted the amended fdd for registration in those states in which the company has registered its franchise offering 
the company currently is able to offer franchises in all states except maryland 
several franchisees have been experiencing financial pressures which  in certain instances  became more exacerbated during fiscal the company has guaranteed certain obligations of franchisees in which it has an equity interest  as described in other commitments and contingencies in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a provision for estimated payments under guarantees related to a franchisee of million  during the quarter  the franchisee defaulted on certain of the obligations guaranteed by the company 
during the year ended february   two of the company s other franchisees filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of these bankruptcy cases was substantially concluded in february upon the sale of the franchisee s assets to  and assumption of most of its franchise agreements by  a successor franchisee  the other franchise operation is continuing to operate under court supervision 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal while franchisees have contractual commitments to open over additional stores in fiscal and thereafter  the company believes franchisees also will close additional stores in the future  and the number of such closures may be significant 
royalty revenues and most of kk supply chain revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows

systemwide sales  a non gaap financial measure  include sales by both company and franchise stores 
the company believes systemwide sales data are useful in assessing the overall performance of the krispy kreme brand and  ultimately  the performance of the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein include sales by company stores  sales to franchisees by the kk supply chain business segment and royalties and fees received from franchisees  but exclude sales by franchise stores to their customers 
the table below presents average weekly sales per factory store which represents  on a company and systemwide basis  total sales of all stores divided by the number of operating weeks for factory stores and average weekly sales per store which represents  on a company and systemwide basis  total sales of all stores divided by the number of operating weeks for both factory stores and satellites 
operating weeks represent  on a company and systemwide basis  the aggregate number of weeks in the fiscal year that factory stores or both factory and satellite stores were in operation 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal contained weeks 
to enhance comparability among the last three fiscal years  amounts in the table set forth below for fiscal have been computed based upon the week period ended january  fiscal year dollars in thousands average weekly sales per factory store company systemwide factory store operating weeks company    systemwide    average weekly sales per store company systemwide store operating weeks company    systemwide    excludes intersystem sales between company and franchise stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal overview excluding sales for the rd week  systemwide sales decreased compared to fiscal  reflecting a decrease in average weekly sales per store  partially offset by a increase in store operating weeks 
the systemwide sales decrease reflects an decrease in company stores sales and a increase in franchise store sales 
during fiscal  one new company factory store and new franchise factory stores were opened  nine company factory stores and franchise factory stores were closed  and three company factory stores and four franchise factory stores were converted from factory stores to satellite stores 
the total number of factory stores at the end of fiscal was  consisting of company stores and franchise stores 
satellite stores made up of the total systemwide store count as of february  compared to at january  systemwide average weekly sales per store are lower than company average weekly sales per store principally because satellite stores  which generally have lower average weekly sales than factory stores  are operated almost exclusively by franchisees 
in addition  the increasing percentage of total stores which are satellite stores has the effect of reducing the overall systemwide average weekly sales per store 
revenues for fiscal  revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal excluding revenues for the rd week  revenues for fiscal decreased to million

company stores revenues were million in fiscal excluding revenues for the rd week  company stores revenues were million  a decrease of from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis reflects a decline in store operating weeks partially offset by a increase in average weekly sales per store 
the decrease in store operating weeks reflects the sale or closure of factory stores since the end of fiscal the increase in the average weekly sales per store reflects  among other things  the closure of relatively poorer performing locations and the benefits of consolidating production for wholesale customers into a smaller number of factory stores  as well as the effects of price increases 
on premises sales which include fundraising sales comprised approximately and of total company stores revenues in fiscal and  respectively  with the balance comprised of off premises sales 
the following table sets forth statistical data with respect to on and off premises sales by company stores 
the data have been computed by comparing the weeks ended january  to the weeks ended january  the change in same store sales is computed by dividing the aggregate on premises sales including fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for more than consecutive weeks during the current year but only to the extent such sales occurred in the th or later week of each store s operation by the aggregate on premises sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year 
once a store has been open for at least consecutive weeks  its sales are included in the computation of same stores sales for all subsequent periods 
in the event a store is closed temporarily for example  for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks  such store s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation 
for off premises sales  average weekly number of doors represents the average number of customer locations to which product deliveries are made during a week  and average weekly sales per door represents the average weekly sales to each such location 
weeks ended jan 
 on premises change in same store sales off premises change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises same stores sales were flat for the year  generally reflecting an increase in the average guest check offset by reduced customer traffic 
the decrease in the average weekly number of doors represents a decrease in the grocery mass merchant channel  partially offset by an increase in the average weekly number of doors in the convenience store channel 
the average weekly sales per door fell in both channels 
a decrease in average weekly sales per door generally adversely affects profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
in addition  delivery costs have been rising due to  among other things  rising fuel costs 
franchise revenues 
franchise revenues consist principally of royalties payable to the company by franchisees based upon the franchisees sales and initial franchise fees earned by the company in connection with new store openings by franchisees 
the components of franchise revenues are as follows year ended feb 
 jan 
 dollars in thousands royalties   development and franchise fees   other total revenues   excluding the rd week  franchise revenues were million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal royalty revenues measured on a week basis rose to million in fiscal from in fiscal sales by franchise stores  as reported by the franchisees  were approximately million measured on a week basis in fiscal and million in fiscal the company did not recognize as revenue approximately million of uncollected royalties which accrued during each of fiscal and because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
all of the growth in franchisee sales in fiscal was attributable to an increase in the number of franchise stores outside the united states 
domestic franchisee sales fell in fiscal  principally due to store closings in fiscal and franchisee fees declined approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal franchise fee revenue included approximately  of fees related to amendments to agreements with certain international franchisees 
the development and franchise agreements with these franchisees contemplated development only of factory stores  and were amended to provide for initial franchise fees for satellite stores and to provide for development of satellite stores to be partially creditable against the franchisees store development obligations 
the company did not record initial franchise fees related to these franchisees satellite stores until the company agreed with the franchisees on the amount of initial franchise fee to be paid with respect to these stores 
this decrease in franchise fees was offset by an increase in franchise fees arising from an increase in store openings by franchisees in compared to franchisees opened stores in fiscal the company currently expects that the number of franchise store openings in fiscal will be fewer than in fiscal franchisees closed stores in fiscal the company believes franchisees will close additional stores in the future  and the number of such closures may be significant 
royalty revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on franchise revenues 
kk supply chain revenues 
kk supply chain revenues were million in fiscal excluding the rd week  kk supply chain revenues were million  a decrease from million in fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis was lower sales by domestic franchisees  which resulted in an approximate decrease in sales of mixes  icings and fillings  sugar  shortening and supplies by kk supply chain 
in addition  an increasing percentage of franchisee sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
in certain instances  instead of selling finished doughnut mix to international franchisees  the company sells doughnut mix concentrate  which is combined with other ingredients sourced locally to produce doughnut mix 
while the kk supply chain s profit on sales of concentrate is intended to be similar to the profit which would be earned on the finished mix made from that concentrate  sales of concentrate generate less revenue than would sales of an equivalent amount of finished mix 
in addition  many of the other ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
the kk supply chain revenue decrease was also attributable to a decrease in sales of equipment and equipment services in fiscal compared to fiscal franchisee expansion in fiscal was comprised principally of satellite stores  which require less equipment than do factory stores 
sales of equipment and related services measured on a week basis including signage  beverage equipment  furniture  fixtures and similar items sold through the kk supply chain distribution centers represented approximately and of kk supply chain revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
franchisees opened stores in fiscal the company currently expects that the number of franchise store openings in fiscal will be fewer than in fiscal franchisees closed stores in fiscal the company believes franchisees will close additional stores in the future  and the number of such closures may be significant 
a significant majority of kk supply chain s revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on kk supply chain revenues 
in fiscal  the company divested a kk supply chain manufacturing and distribution facility see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the business conducted by the divested facility was transferred to other kk supply chain locations and  accordingly  the divestiture has had no significant effect on kk supply chain revenues 
the company also is evaluating strategic options related to other aspects of the supply chain 
in particular  we currently are in discussions and conducting product testing with third party mix manufacturers regarding contract mix production for regions outside the southeastern united states 
in addition  the lease on our los angeles facility expires in may  and we currently are considering either relocating the facility or outsourcing distribution in the western united states to a third party 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses  which exclude depreciation and amortization expense  were of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal direct operating expenses by business segment expressed in dollars and as a percentage of applicable segment revenues are set forth in the table below 
such operating expenses are consistent with the segment operating income data set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
amounts shown below for the company stores and kk supply chain segments for fiscal differ from those amounts as previously reported 
as previously reported  the estimated profit earned by the kk supply chain segment on sales to the company stores segment was deducted from company stores direct operating expenses to illustrate the effects of the company s vertical integration on the overall profit earned on company stores revenues 
the company has discontinued that profit attribution technique because management concluded that presenting direct operating expenses on a basis consistent with that used for reporting segment operating results was more relevant to users of the financial statements 
amounts previously reported for fiscal have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation for fiscal in fiscal  the company revised its allocation of corporate overhead costs to its operating segments to make such allocations more consistent with the current cost of providing support services to the operating segments  such revision resulted in an increase of million in costs allocated to segment direct operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal  and a corresponding reduction in general and administrative expenses 
the effect of the change in allocated costs is discussed within the discussion of each segment s direct operating expenses below

company stores direct operating expenses as a percentage of company stores revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase reflects  among other things  higher costs of doughnut mix and certain other ingredients resulting from price increases instituted by kk supply chain in order to partially offset higher raw materials costs  as well as increased direct labor and higher delivery vehicle and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues 
kk supply chain instituted additional price increases in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of a continued rise in the cost of certain materials  of which flour and shortening are the most significant 
the company has been experiencing a decline in the average weekly sales per door in the off premises distribution channel 
a decrease in average weekly sales per door generally adversely affects profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
in addition  delivery costs have been rising due to  among other things  rising fuel costs 
the increase in company stores direct operating expenses as a percentage of company stores revenues is also a result of a million increase in the allocation of corporate overhead costs in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company refined the attribution of the cost of certain insurance and employee benefits among its business segments and general and administrative functions in order to attribute these costs to the company s different operations more precisely 
while the procedural refinement had no effect on total operating income  the company estimates the refinement had the effect of increasing company stores direct operating expenses by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  with a corresponding decrease in general and administrative expenses 
franchise direct operating expenses 
franchise direct operating expenses include costs to recruit new franchisees  to assist in store openings  and to monitor and aid the performance of franchise stores  as well as direct general and administrative expenses and allocated corporate costs 
franchise direct operating expenses rose primarily due to increased costs associated with recruitment and development of international franchisees and related store opening assistance 
the increase in franchise direct operating expenses also reflects a million increase in the allocation of corporate overhead costs in fiscal compared to fiscal kk supply chain direct operating expenses 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses as a percentage of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment eliminations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the cost of raw materials used in the production of doughnut mix and of other goods sold to company and franchise stores was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal in particular  the prices of flour and shortening and the products from which they are made rose significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal during  kk supply chain increased the prices charged to company and franchise stores for doughnut mixes  shortening and other goods in order to mitigate increased costs  however  those price increases did not fully offset the rise in kk supply chain s costs compared to fiscal the company has implemented additional price increases in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of continuing increases in the cost of certain raw materials  particularly flour and shortening 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses include bad debt provisions related to certain franchisee receivables of approximately million approximately of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to approximately million approximately of revenues before intersegment eliminations in fiscal as of february   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts from affiliated and unaffiliated franchisees totaled approximately million 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses in fiscal reflect a million increase in the allocation of corporate overhead costs compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company refined the attribution of the cost of certain insurance and employee benefits among its business segments and general and administrative functions in order to attribute these costs to the company s different operations more precisely 
while the procedural refinement had no effect on total operating income  the company estimates the refinement had the effect of increasing kk supply chain direct operating expenses by approximately  for fiscal compared to fiscal  with a corresponding decrease in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million of total revenues in fiscal compared to million of total revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses include professional fees paid to the interim management firm engaged by the company in january through march  and professional fees related to the internal and external investigations and litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  totaling approximately million in fiscal and approximately million net of estimated insurance recoveries of approximately million in fiscal the professional fees for fiscal include approximately million related to the warrant to acquire million shares of the company s common stock issued to the interim management firm as part of its compensation for services rendered to the company  as more fully described under warrant issued in exchange for services in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal include approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter for severance costs related to the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer  of which approximately million relates to share based compensation including accelerated vesting of certain equity awards 
in fiscal  the company revised its allocation of corporate overhead costs to its operating segments to make such allocations more consistent with the current cost of providing support services to the operating segments 
such revision resulted in an increase of million in costs allocated to segment direct operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal  and a corresponding reduction in general and administrative expenses 
in addition  in fiscal the company refined the attribution of the cost of certain insurance and employee benefits among its business segments and general and administrative functions in order to attribute these costs to the company s different operations more precisely 
while the procedural refinement had no effect on total operating income  the company estimates the refinement had the effect of decreasing general and administrative expenses by approximately million in fiscal  with a corresponding increase in segment direct operating expenses  the substantial majority of which is reflected in company stores direct operating expenses 
exclusive of the effects of unusual professional fees  of officer severance pay and of changes in the allocation of corporate overhead  insurance and benefits costs  general and administrative expenses were million of revenues and million of revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease reflects  among other things  a decline in other professional fees of million 
in fiscal  the company incurred increased accounting  legal and other costs associated with work on the company s financial statements and filings with the commission  the initial cost of strategic initiatives related to product  customer and market research and initiatives designed to achieve cost reductions related to the procurement of goods and services 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the reduction in the number of company factory stores operating in fiscal compared to fiscal and to a lower depreciable base of property and equipment resulting from impairment charges in the current and prior years related to stores which continue to operate 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased depreciation charges related to the company s mix manufacturing and distribution facility in effingham  illinois  which the company divested in january  the estimated useful life of which was adjusted downward at the end of the second quarter of fiscal as a consequence of the company s decision to divest the facility 
total depreciation expense related to the effingham facility was approximately million in fiscal impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal impairment charges related to long lived assets totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal  of which approximately million and million  respectively  related to the company stores segment 
approximately million of the fiscal charges in the company stores segment were recorded in the fourth quarter 
the charges relate to stores closed or expected to be closed  as well as charges with respect to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
the company closed nine factory stores in fiscal and eight factory stores in fiscal the company tests other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing decisions  the effects of changing costs including the impact of rising commodity costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of a change in circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
the company records impairment charges associated with stores in the accounting period in which a store closing decision is made or in which the carrying value of the store is otherwise determined to be nonrecoverable 
in addition  during fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to its manufacturing and distribution facility in effingham  illinois  which the company divested as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
such charge is net of a credit of approximately million recorded upon the sale of the facility in the fourth quarter to adjust earlier estimates of its net realizable value 
finally  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million fiscal to reduce the carrying value of its kk supply chain coffee roasting assets to their estimated fair value upon disposition 
the company sold these assets for approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal impairment charges related to goodwill were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  substantially all of which relate to the company stores segment 
such charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the goodwill impairment charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value  which the company estimates using the present value of expected future cash flows 
such charges reflect reductions in the company s forecasted sales and earnings in certain of the reporting units comprising the company stores and kk supply chain segments  which caused a reduction in the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
such reductions reflect current operating results  including the effects of higher materials and labor costs  as well as recent trends in operating results 
the company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of december lease termination costs represent the net present value of remaining contractual lease payments related to closed stores  after reduction by estimated sublease rental  and are recorded when the lease contract is terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
lease termination costs were approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal the company received  in connection with its assignment of leases related to closed stores in fiscal  lease termination charges related to other closed stores offset the credit to earnings resulting from these assignments 
the company is developing a strategy to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeast 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
because the company has not completed the development of its detailed refranchising plans and has not entered into any new domestic franchise agreements in several years  the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any such markets or the amount of any proceeds which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreements 
refranchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets 
settlement of litigation on october   the company agreed to settle a federal securities class action and to settle  in part  certain shareholder derivative actions  as more fully described in item  legal proceedings  and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
as part of the settlement  the company issued to the plaintiffs  shares of the company s common stock and warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at a price of per share

the company experienced a decline in revenues and incurred net losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
the revenue decline reflects fewer company stores in operation  a decline in domestic royalty revenues and lower sales of mixes and other ingredients resulting from lower sales by the company s domestic franchisees 
lower revenues have adversely affected operating margins because of the fixed or semi fixed nature of many of the company s direct operating expenses

based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
in february  the company completed a refinancing using the proceeds of the secured credit facilities described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  which are the company s principal source of external financing 
these facilities consist of a million term loan maturing in february and a million revolving credit facility maturing in february the secured credit facilities contain significant financial and other covenants 
based on its operating plan  the company projected that it would not be able to comply with the financial covenants in fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company executed amendments to the secured credit facilities which  among other things  relaxed the financial covenants contained therein for fiscal and the financial covenants as of february   and the amended financial covenants for future years  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
while the company was in compliance with the financial covenants as of february   and the company expects to be able to comply with the amended financial covenants based on its operating plan  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
as a result of amendments and waivers in fiscal and  the company paid fees of approximately  and the interest rate on the loans has increased from libor plus to libor plus with a libor floor of 
the increase in rates will result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense based on the current level of borrowings

failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in the credit facilities  or the occurrence or failure to occur of certain events  would cause the company to default under the facilities 
in the absence of a waiver of  or forbearance with respect to  any such default from the company s lenders  the company could be obligated to repay outstanding indebtedness under the facilities in advance of its scheduled maturity  and the company s ability to access additional borrowings under the facilities would be restricted 
in the event the company were to fail to comply with one or more such covenants  the company would attempt to negotiate waivers of any such noncompliance 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to negotiate any such waivers  and the costs or conditions associated with any such waivers could be significant 
in the event that credit under the secured credit facilities were not available to the company  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of credit would be available to the company or  if they are available  under what terms or at what cost 
many factors could adversely affect the company s business

one of these bankruptcy cases was substantially concluded in february upon the sale of the franchisee s assets to  and assumption of most of its franchise agreements by  a successor franchisee  the other franchise operation is continuing to operate under court supervision 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal franchisees have contractual commitments to open over additional stores after fiscal  however  the company believes franchisees also will close additional stores in the future  and the number of such closures may be significant 
royalty revenues and most of kk supply chain revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business

in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist of the company s guarantees of indebtedness and lease obligations of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and certain potential indemnification obligations also discussed in note contractual cash obligations at february  the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  are as follows payments due in less more than than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities    interest payment obligations      payment obligations on interest rate hedge    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations    guarantee obligations   other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims      k mirror plan liability total      interest rates utilized to estimate interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of february  and have been computed on a pro forma basis to give effect to the amendments to the company s secured credit facilities executed in april represents estimated amounts payable without reduction for any amount due to the company or payable by the company pursuant to an interest rate hedge agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
interest rates utilized to estimate payments on the interest rate hedge are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of february  the preceding table of contractual cash obligations excludes income tax liabilities of approximately million as of february  for unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty in predicting the timing of any such related payments 
capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other corporate purposes opening new company stores in selected markets  principally satellite shops remodeling and relocation of selected older company shops investments in systems and personnel restructuring initiatives the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and infrastructure needs for both personnel and facilities 
these capital outlays are subject to limitations contained in the secured credit facilities 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during the three years in the period ended february   some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
fas requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the fair value of the cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units and affect the recorded balances of goodwill 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balances of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment analyses of goodwill in fiscal  and resulted in impairment charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of february   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million  all of which was associated with the franchise segment 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in fiscal  and  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately million  million and  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for the estimated cost of claims  without regard to the effects of stop loss coverage  using actuarial methods which evaluate known open and incurred but not reported claims and consider historical loss development experience 
in addition  the company records receivables from the insurance carriers for claims amounts estimated to be recovered under the stop loss insurance policies when these amounts are estimable and probable of collection 
the company estimates such stop loss receivables using the same actuarial methods used to establish the related claims accruals  and taking into account the amount of risk transferred to the carriers under the stop loss policies 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these loss accruals and related insurance receivables 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets as required under fas  accounting for income taxes 
at february   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company  that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of loan and lease obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records liabilities for the present value of anticipated payments when the company believes that an obligation to perform under the guarantees is probable 
no liabilities for the guarantees were recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of february   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately million related to such guarantees  which totaled approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain equity method franchisees 
while the company believes that the recorded amounts of such investments are realizable  these franchisees typically do not have an extensive operating history  and the value of the company s investments in the franchisees cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
as of february   the company s investment in equity method franchisees was approximately million 
stock based compensation in fiscal the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that stock awards  including stock options  granted to employees and which ultimately vest be recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at the grant date 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
the fair value of stock options which contain market conditions as well as service conditions is estimated using monte carlo simulation techniques 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards which ultimately will vest  and periodically adjust such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value  and techniques other than monte carlo simulation could be used to estimate the value of stock options which are subject to both service and market conditions 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
during first quarter of fiscal as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
the new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
fas is effective for the company in fiscal in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
management does not intend to adopt any fair value measurement options permitted by fas and  accordingly  does not expect fas to have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap 
as a result of fas  there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap  which is expected to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable 
the company must adopt fas in fiscal management does not expect adoption of fas to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the prime rate  fed funds rate or libor 
the interest cost of the company s debt is affected by changes in short term interest rates and increases in those rates adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has entered into interest rate derivative contracts having an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the derivative contracts eliminate the company s exposure  with respect to such notional amount  to increases in three month libor beyond through april  and eliminate the company s ability to benefit from a reduction in three month libor below for the same period 
as of february   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in an increase in the company s annual interest expense of approximately  after giving effect to the change in payments due to or from the company from the interest rate hedge described above 
because the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in united states dollars  the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is limited 
the company s investment in its franchisee operating in mexico and the company s operations in canada expose the company to exchange rate risk 
in addition  although royalties from international franchisees are payable to the company in united states dollars  changes in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the foreign currencies used in the countries in which the international franchisees operate will affect the company s royalty revenues 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar and shortening are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one month s to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
other purchase arrangements typically are contractual arrangements with vendors for example  with respect to certain beverages and ingredients under which the company is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of goods  but must purchase minimum percentages of its requirements for such goods from these vendors with whom it has executed these contracts 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat and soybean oil 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient 
quantitative information about the company s unassigned commodity futures contracts as of february   all of which mature in fiscal  is set forth in the table below 
aggregate weighted contract aggregate average contract amount fair contract volume or strike price or strike price value dollars in thousands  except average prices wheat futures contracts  bu 
bu 
 although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate commodity price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that is subject to such contracts varies from time to time 
recently  prices for wheat and soy bean oil have been at or near all time highs and dairy prices have risen 
continued high prices or further adverse changes in commodity prices could adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity 
the following table illustrates the potential effect on the company s costs resulting from hypothetical changes in the cost of the company s three most significant ingredients

the range of prices paid for fiscal set forth in the table above reflect the effects of any forward purchase contracts entered into at various times prior to delivery of the goods and  accordingly  do not necessarily reflect the range of prices of these ingredients prevailing in the market during the fiscal year
