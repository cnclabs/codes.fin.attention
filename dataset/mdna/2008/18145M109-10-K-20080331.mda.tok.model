after payments for the purchase price of clark  deferred underwriter commissions and transaction related expenses  the company had approximately  remaining 
in connection with the acquisition  stockholders owning  of our then outstanding shares of common stock voted against the acquisition and exercised their right to convert their shares into a pro rata portion of the trust account 
the per share conversion price is equal to the amount in the trust account inclusive of any interest thereon as of february   two business days prior to the acquisition  divided by the number of shares of common stock sold in the public offering  or approximately per share

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates
