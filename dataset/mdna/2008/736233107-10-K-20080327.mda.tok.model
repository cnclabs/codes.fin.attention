item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of porter bancorp inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  pbi bank 
porter bancorp  inc is a louisville  kentucky based bank holding company which operates full service banking offices in twelve counties through its wholly owned subsidiary  pbi bank 
our markets include metropolitan louisville in jefferson county and the surrounding counties of henry and bullitt  and extend south along the interstate corridor to tennessee 
we serve south central kentucky and southern kentucky from banking offices in cumberland  butler  green  hart  edmonson  barren  warren  ohio  and daviess counties 
we also have an office in lexington  kentucky  the second largest city in kentucky 
our markets have experienced annual positive deposit growth rates in recent years with the trend expected to continue for the next few years 
the bank is both a traditional community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products and an innovative online bank which delivers competitive deposit products and services through an on line banking division operating under the name of ascencia 
in  we completed a reorganization in which we acquired the minority interests of our three partially owned bank holding companies and consolidated our five subsidiary banks under the common control of our founders into a single bank 
in the reorganization  we terminated the elections by our company and our banking subsidiary to be subchapter s corporations for federal income tax purposes 
as a subchapter s corporation with two shareholders  we historically paid a substantial portion of our net income as dividends to fund the tax liability our shareholders owed on our income and to provide a return on their investment 
dividends paid in  our last year as a subchapter s corporation  represented of our net income 
as a c corporation  we now pay federal and state income taxes directly  but our shareholders no longer have to pay taxes on their share of our income  and we have adjusted our dividend policy accordingly 
the dividends we have paid in and and may pay in the future are subject to our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  future prospects and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
on september   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price per share of 
the aggregate purchase price of the offering was million 
the company sold  newly issued shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  and selling shareholders sold  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  for their own accounts 
the net proceeds to us were million after deducting total expenses of million 
on october   we completed the acquisition of ohio county bancshares  and its wholly owned subsidiary kentucky trust bank 
the aggregate purchase price was million paid in cash and stock 
we acquired million in assets and million in deposits and recorded million in goodwill and million in core deposit intangibles 
this acquisition established our presence in ohio and daviess counties and improved our market position in warren county 
subsequent to year end  we completed the acquisition of paramount bank in lexington  kentucky  in a million all cash transaction 
we acquired million in assets and million in deposits and recorded goodwill of million and million in core deposit intangibles 
this acquisition established our physical presence in lexington  kentucky  fayette county  the second largest market in the state 
we focus on commercial and commercial real estate lending  both in markets where we have banking offices and other growing markets in our region 
commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loans accounted for of our total loan portfolio as of december   and as of december   and contributed significantly to our earnings 
commercial lending generally produces higher yields than residential lending  but requires more rigorous underwriting standards and credit quality monitoring 
overview of the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report 

table of contents for the year ended december   we reported net income of million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  basic and diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to for highlights for the year ended december  were loans grew to billion compared to million at december  total assets increased to billion since the fourth quarter of  fueled by strong loan growth and the acquisition of kentucky trust bank 
deposits grew to billion since the fourth quarter of core customer non interest bearing deposit accounts increased to million from million during million of the increase in core customer non interest bearing deposit accounts was attributable to organic growth 
our efficiency ratio continues to outperform our peers at for compared with for we completed the acquisition of ohio county bancshares  inc  the holding company for kentucky trust bank  effective october  the kentucky trust bank acquisition added six retail banking offices in three kentucky counties  including the bowling green and owensboro markets 
pbi bank signed a definitive agreement to acquire paramount bank in lexington  kentucky during the acquisition closed at the beginning of february and increased our loans and deposits by million 
these items are discussed in further detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses pbi bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio  and the senior loan committee evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance using  among other things  historical loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
while we evaluate the allowance for loan losses  in part  based on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio depend more on credit analysis and recent payment performance 
the allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our increase in commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
we develop allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  we may be required to materially increase our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses and adversely affect our results 
goodwill and intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value  net of goodwill  exceeds book value  then goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years expected to be benefited  which we believe is years 
we review these amortizable intangible assets for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
based on the annual goodwill impairment test as of december   management does not believe any of the goodwill is impaired as of that date 
while management believes no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that 
table of contents date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment revised  on january  among other things  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r requires that management make assumptions including stock price volatility and employee turnover that are utilized to measure compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  such as volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend pay out rates 
valuation of deferred tax asset we evaluate deferred tax assets quarterly 
we will realize this asset to the extent it is profitable or carry back tax losses to periods in which we paid income taxes 
our determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset will be based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income we will earn and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets 
management believes we will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
examinations of our income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact the tax liabilities and resulting provisions for income taxes

non interest expense increased million  or  in comparison to as a result of increased salary and benefits expense and an increase in occupancy and equipment expense primarily related to the kentucky trust bank acquisition

loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed of 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of legal counsel 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans placed on non accrual status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  which typically occurs after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinued  existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid 
table of contents principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense

interest income recognized on accruing non performing loans was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans more than days past due increased  from december  to december  non accrual loans increased million from december  to december  this increase was primarily attributable to two commercial real estate loans to a common borrower and one residential construction loan 
management believes these loans are well secured and has begun the appropriate collection actions to resolve them 
management believes it has established adequate loan loss reserves for these credits 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of individual loans  loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various categories of loans and such other factors that  in management s judgment  require current recognition in estimating loan losses 
the following table sets forth an analysis of loan loss experience as of and for the periods indicated as of december  dollars in thousands balances at beginning of period loans charged off real estate commercial consumer agriculture other total charge offs recoveries real estate commercial consumer agriculture other total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance acquired in bank acquisition balance at end of period allowance for loan losses to total loans net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans 
table of contents our allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses in comprised of three components specific reserves  general reserves and unallocated reserves 
generally  all loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific allowance is required 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once a loan has been identified as impaired  management measures impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
when management s measured value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve 
these specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis based on management s current evaluation of our loss exposure for each credit  given the payment status  financial condition of the borrower and value of any underlying collateral 
loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general reserve and unallocated allowance calculations described below 
changes in specific reserves from period to period are the result in changes in the circumstances of individual loans such as charge offs  pay offs  changes in collateral values or other factors 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount necessary to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio  management s judgment of the amount of the allowance necessary to absorb loan losses is approximate 
the allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination by the regulatory agencies as to its adequacy in comparison with peer institutions 
we make specific allowances for each impaired loan based on its type and classification as discussed above 
we also maintain a general reserve for each loan type in the loan portfolio 
in determining the amount of the general reserve portion of our allowance for loan losses  management considers factors such as our historical loan loss experience  the growth  composition and diversification of our loan portfolio  current delinquency levels  the results of recent regulatory examinations and general economic conditions 
based on these factors we apply estimated percentages to the various categories of loans  not including any loan that has a specific allowance allocated to it  based on our historical experience  portfolio trends and economic and industry trends 
this information is used by management to set the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses at a level it deems prudent 
our emphasis on continued growth of our loan portfolio through the origination of construction  commercial mortgage and family residential loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating the general portion of our allowance for loan losses 
because there are additional risks of losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or types of loans  including general economic and business conditions and credit quality trends  we have established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on our evaluation of these risks 
the unallocated portion of our allowance is determined based on various factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions of our market area  the growth  composition and diversification of our loan portfolio  types of collateral securing our loans  the experience level of our lending officers and staff  the quality of our credit risk management and the results of independent third party reviews of our classification of credits 
due to the relative stability of many of the factors listed above  the unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the total allowance has remained consistent over the periods presented 
as of december  and  the unallocated portions of the allowance for loan losses were  or of the total allowance  and  or of the total allowance  respectively 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to our board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance for loan losses since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as events change 
we used the same methodology and generally similar assumptions in assessing the allowance for both comparison periods 
we decreased the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding to at december  from at december  the level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from these estimates 
we follow a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list which helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans categorized as watch list loans show warning elements where the present status exhibits one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s repayment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  loans are categorized as special mention  substandard or doubtful 
loans classified as special mention do not have all of the characteristics of substandard or doubtful loans 
they have one or more deficiencies which warrant special attention and which corrective action  such as accelerated collection practices  may remedy 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition which may jeopardize the repayment of the debt as contractually agreed 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
once a loan is deemed impaired or uncollectible as contractually agreed  the loan is charged off either partially or in full against the allowance for loan losses  based upon the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of collateral with respect to collateral based loans 
as of december   we had million of loans classified as substandard   classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and none classified as loss 
this compares with million of loans classified as substandard   classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and none classified as loss as of december  the million increase in loans classified as substandard is primarily attributable to the downgrade of credits displaying financial weakness indicated by inconsistent payments 
factors affecting each credit are specific to the borrowers business or related to macro economic events and we continue to monitor these credits regularly 
as of december  we had specific allocations of million in the allowance for loan losses related to these classified loans 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december   compared with million for and million for the total allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans at december   compared with million or of total loans at december   and million or of total loans at december  the increased allowance is primarily due to increases in our loan portfolio of million from december  to december  and million from december  to december  net charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared with  for and million for we acquired a financial institution in and applied generally accepted accounting principles in connection with these acquisitions 
more specifically  we applied the provisions of statement of position accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer to the transaction 
we identified no substantial loan or homogenous group of loans having evidence of deterioration of credit quality as defined by the statement 
as a result  the existing allowance for loan loss in the amount of million was recorded as of the date of acquisition 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance funding and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors 
since these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future portfolio performance 
the allocation is made by analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans

mortgage backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as government national mortgage association ginnie mae  fannie mae and freddie mac 
these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities that are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  those securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be shortened 
if interest rates begin to fall  prepayments will increase 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities we held had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of years 
deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years we have been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short to mid term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives  including brokered and wholesale deposits  that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of their use on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
we primarily rely on our banking office network to attract and retain deposits in our local markets and leverage our online ascencia division to attract out of market deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
during  total deposits increased million compared with during  total deposits increased by million compared with the increase in deposits each year was primarily in money market accounts and certificate of deposit balances 

table of contents to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from continually changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins along with other pertinent economic data 
we continue to offer attractively priced deposit products along our product line to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during various rising and falling rate cycles 
we offer savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed rate certificates with varying maturities 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
our management adjusts interest rates  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties on our deposit products periodically 
the variety of deposit products allows us to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into outside investment alternatives 
however  our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the costs of these funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions

borrowing deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati to supplement our pool of lendable funds  
table of contents meet deposit withdrawal requirements and manage the terms of our liabilities 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage residential loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain standards related to creditworthiness

we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
if we defer these interest payments  we would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
the trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary trusts are currently included in our tier capital for regulatory purposes 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted final rules that continue to allow trust preferred securities to be included in tier capital  subject to stricter quantitative and qualitative limits 
currently  no more than of our tier i capital can consist of trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock

each of the trusts issuing the trust preferred securities holds junior subordinated debentures we issued with a year maturity 
the final rules provide that in the last five years before the junior subordinated debentures mature  the associated trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital 
in addition  the trust preferred securities during this five year period would be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth each year and excluded from tier capital completely during the year before maturity 
liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity risk management also involves ensuring that we meet our cash flow needs at a reasonable cost 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
our asset liability committee continually monitors and reviews our liquidity position 
funds are available from a number of sources  including the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal pay downs on loans and mortgage backed securities  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
during and we utilized brokered and wholesale deposits to supplement our funding strategy 
at december   these deposits totaled million 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from major correspondent banks totaling million on an unsecured basis and an additional million on a secured basis

at december   we had an unused borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we use cash to pay dividends on common stock  if and when declared by the board of directors  and to service debt 
the main sources of funding include dividends paid by pbi bank  management fees received from pbi bank and affiliated banks and financing obtained in the capital markets 
capital stockholders equity increased million to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase was due to the issuance of common stock in our acquisition of ohio county bancshares and net income earned during reduced by dividends declared

we enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit as of december  are summarized below

if the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  we would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
commitments to extend credit we enter into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
we have an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which is comprised of senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given an instantaneous basis point decrease in rates that was sustained for months  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared with a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared with an increase of at december  the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios for the year ended december   as calculated using the static shock model approach change in future net interest income change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 
our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  we cannot assure you that assumed repricing rates will approximate our actual future activity
