item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust reit organized under the texas real estate investment trust act 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties which includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties of approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during we focus on increasing funds from operations ffo and growing dividend payments to our common shareholders 
we do this through hands on leasing  management and selected redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 

table of contents we continue to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements and matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
the turmoil in the current capital markets has adversely affected both the pricing and the availability of certain financial instruments 
however  based on our business plan for the upcoming year  we believe that asset dispositions  joint venture relationships and existing capital resources such as our revolving credit facilities will provide adequate capital to execute our business plan 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers  industrial projects and three other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 
we also owned interests in parcels of unimproved land held for future development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio was at december  compared to at december  historically  occupancy for the total portfolio has never fallen below 
we expect our existing portfolio occupancy to continue at this level due to our tenant diversification and a strong tenant anchor base in another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a cash basis 
in the first quarter of  we articulated a new long term growth strategy with a planned three year implementation 
the key elements of this strategy are as follows a much greater focus on new development  including merchant development  with million in annual new development completions beginning in increased use of joint ventures for acquisitions including the recapitalization or partial sale of existing assets  which provide the opportunity to further increase returns on investment through the generation of fee income from leasing and management services we will provide to the venture 
further recycling capital through the active disposition of non core properties and reinvesting the proceeds into properties with barriers to entry within high growth metropolitan markets 
this  combined with our continuous focus on our assets  produces a higher quality portfolio with higher occupancy rates and much stronger internal revenue growth 
during and  we made excellent progress in the execution of this long term growth strategy as described in the following sections on new development  acquisitions and joint ventures and dispositions 

table of contents new development at december   we had properties in various stages of development  including our merchant development program  which is up from properties under development a year ago 
we have invested million to date on these projects and  at completion we estimate our total investment to be million 
these properties are slated to open over the next one to five years with a projected return on investment of approximately when completed 
in addition to these projects  we have a development pipeline with eight development sites under contract  which will represent a projected investment of approximately million 
due to current economic factors  obtaining new projects over the next year may prove challenging as potential retail anchors are delaying their expansion plans due to the softening of the economy 
we will continue to seek opportunities and monitor this market closely 
merchant development is a new program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels and non operating properties are included in this program 
we generated gains of approximately million from this program during we expect to generate similar gains in and throughout future years 
acquisitions and joint ventures during  we acquired shopping centers  industrial properties  our partner s interest in a retail center and one other operating property for a purchase price of approximately million 
included in that total were seven retail properties and seven industrial properties purchased as part of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 
it is possible that  consistent with our strategy  some of the other acquired properties will also be contributed to future joint ventures 
acquisitions are a key component of our strategy 
however  the turmoil in the credit markets has significantly reduced transactions in the marketplace and  therefore  created uncertainty with respect to pricing 
partnering with institutional investors through joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
we benefit from access to lower cost capital  as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services such as the acquisition  leasing and management of properties  to the joint ventures 
joint venture fee income for was approximately million or an increase of million over this is a direct result of our strategy initiative to develop new joint venture relationships 
we expect continued strong growth in joint venture income during the upcoming year 
dispositions during  we sold shopping centers  one industrial distribution center and one industrial building for million 
also  one shopping center in an unconsolidated joint venture was sold  of which our share of the sales proceeds totaled million 
although lenders for prospective acquirers have tightened their underwriting criteria  we expect to continue to dispose of non core properties during the coming year as opportunities present themselves 
dispositions are part of an ongoing portfolio management process where we prune our portfolio of properties that do not meet our geographic or growth targets and provide capital to recycle into properties that have barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets 
over time  we expect this to produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and much stronger internal revenue growth 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  which begins the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recognized 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
in addition  in circumstances where we would provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we would recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
other revenue is income from contractual agreements with third parties  tenants or partially owned real estate joint ventures or partnerships  which is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  we first apply the guidelines set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
based upon our analysis  we have determined that we have no interests in variable interest entities 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we exercise financial and operating control are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we exercise financial and operating control  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but do not exercise financial and operating control  are accounted for using the equity method 
our investments in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  which  in the opinion of management  is not in excess of the individual property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from disposition 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized  and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 

table of contents acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
we have used estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques to allocate the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements and other identifiable intangibles 
current economic and operational property conditions  known trends and changes expected in current market conditions are considered in the estimates of future cash flows used for purchase price allocation purposes 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and one to years for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized  no later than months from the acquisition date 
the impact of incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition asset values and related estimated useful lives could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties and properties in our merchant development program 
merchant development is a new program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels and non operating properties are included in this program 
these properties are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets until the commencement of rental revenue or no later than one year from the completion of major construction 
these costs include pre acquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are directly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
property also includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that are owned by us and will remain our property after the lease expires 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any identifiable intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
our overall future plans for a property and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting estimated future cash flows of a property that are analyzed for these purposes 
the property carrying amount is adjusted  if necessary  to the estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
interest capitalization interest is capitalized on land under development and buildings under construction based on rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period and the weighted average balance of qualified assets under development construction during the period 
differences in methodologies to calculate applicable interest rates and the cost of qualified assets can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized and  as a result  the amount of depreciation recognized 
deferred charges debt and lease costs are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  which approximates the effective interest method  over the terms of the debt and over the lives of leases  respectively 
lease costs represent the initial direct costs incurred in origination  negotiation and processing of a lease agreement 
such costs include outside broker commissions and other independent third party costs  as well as salaries and benefits  travel and other internal costs directly related to completing the leases 
costs related to supervision  administration  unsuccessful origination efforts and other activities not directly related to completed lease agreements are charged to expense as incurred 
differences in methodologies to calculate and defer these costs can yield differences in the amounts deferred and  accordingly  the amount of amortization recognized 

table of contents sales of real estate sales of real estate include the sale of shopping center pads  property adjacent to shopping centers  shopping center properties  merchant development properties  investments in real estate joint ventures and partnerships and partial sales to real estate joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate 
we recognize profit on sales of real estate  including merchant development sales  in accordance with fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
profits are not recognized until a a sale is consummated  b the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay  c the seller s receivable is not subject to future subordination  and d we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction  and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
we recognize gains on the sale of real estate to joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate to the extent we receive cash from the joint venture or partnership  if it meets the sales criteria in accordance with sfas and we do not have a commitment to support the operations of the real estate joint venture or partnership to an extent greater than our proportionate interest in the real estate joint venture or partnership 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
as these factors change  the allowance is subject to revision and may impact the results of operations 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to our shareholders 
to be taxed as a reit  we must meet a number of requirements including defined percentage tests concerning the amount of our assets and revenues that come from  or are attributable to  real estate operations 
as long as we distribute at least of the taxable income of the reit to our shareholders as dividends  we will not be taxed on the portion of our income we distribute as dividends unless we have ineligible transactions 
the tax relief extension act of gave reits the ability to conduct activities which a reit was previously precluded from doing as long as such activities are performed in entities which have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the irs code 
these activities include buying or developing properties with the express purpose of selling them 
we conduct certain of these activities in taxable reit subsidiaries that we have created 
we calculate and record income taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on the activities in those entities 
we also record deferred taxes for the temporary tax differences that have resulted from those activities as required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we use estimates in preparing our deferred tax amounts and if revised  these estimates could impact our results of operations

table of contents effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are payment of our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  payment of our debt service costs and funding planned growth 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all common and preferred dividend payments and debt service costs  as well as the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
we do not anticipate that the current turmoil in the capital markets will have a significant effect on our ability to obtain capital or to execute our business plan 
we believe that asset dispositions  real estate joint venture relationships and existing capital resources such as our revolving credit facilities will provide adequate capital 
our most restrictive debt covenants limit the amount of additional leverage we can add  however  we believe the sources of capital described above are adequate to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
primary sources of capital for funding our acquisitions and new development programs are our revolving credit facilities  cash generated from sales of properties  transactions with venture partners  cash flow generated by our operating properties and proceeds from capital issuances as needed 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from dispositions of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december   the balance outstanding under our million revolving credit facility was million  and no amounts were outstanding under our million credit facility  which we use for cash management purposes 
our capital structure also includes non recourse secured debt that we assume in conjunction with our acquisitions program 
we also have non recourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain a third party consent  such as assets held in entities in which we have less than ownership

related to our investment in a redevelopment project in sheridan  colorado that is held in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guarantee for the payment of any annual sinking fund requirement shortfalls on bonds issued in connection with the project 
the sheridan redevelopment agency issued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on future retail sales 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the bond liability has been paid in full  including any amounts we may have to provide 
we have evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guarantee is nominal 
however  due to the guarantee  a liability has been recorded by the joint venture equal to amounts funded under the bonds 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts defines ffo as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 

table of contents ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties gain loss on sale of properties of unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations funds from operations attributable to operating partnership units funds from operations assuming conversion of op units weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding diluted newly issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
a tax position may only be recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
there are also several disclosure requirements 
we adopted fin as of january   and its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the key changes to current practice are the definition of fair value  which focuses on an exit price rather than an entry price  the methods used to measure fair value  such as emphasis that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  as well as the inclusion of an adjustment for risk  restrictions and credit standing and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of regarding our financial assets and liabilities 
the fasb has issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 to defer the provisions of sfas relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that delays implementation by us until january  sfas is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value  but may result in certain additional disclosures 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this new standard requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
these changes will be reported in comprehensive income 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective for us as of december   and as a result we recognized an additional liability of  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position the measurement provision is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have assessed the potential impact of the measurement provision of sfas and concluded that its adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement is effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r expands the original guidance s definition of a business 
it broadens the fair value measurement and recognition to all assets acquired  liabilities assumed and interests transferred as a result of business combinations 
sfas r requires expanded disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective for us for business combinations made on or after january  while we have not formally quantified the effect  we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if our property acquisitions fall under the definition of a business 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

sfas requires that a noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated entity be reported as equity and any losses in excess of an unconsolidated entity s equity interest will be recorded to the noncontrolling interest 
the statement requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
sfas is effective on january  and most provisions will be applied retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the fasb authorized a proposed fasb staff position the proposed fsp that  if issued  would affect the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures 
if issued in the form expected  the proposed fsp would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding as additional interest expense 
the proposed fsp has not been issued  but the fasb has indicated that it is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retroactive application 
upon the adoption of the proposed fsp on january   we have estimated the unamortized debt discount as of december  to be approximately million to be included as a reduction of debt and approximately million as accumulated additional paid in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we have estimated incremental interest expense to be approximately million and million for the years ended december  and 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  annual net income and cash flows would decrease by million and million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  and  respectively  and the fair value of fixed rate debt at december  and would decrease by million and million  respectively
