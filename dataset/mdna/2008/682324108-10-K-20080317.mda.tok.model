item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this report

throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  oncothyreon  biomira  we  us and our refer to oncothyreon inc  its predecessor  biomira inc  and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies 
we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 
our lead product candidate is stimuvax  which is a cancer vaccine currently in phase development for non small cell lung cancer 
we have an exclusive  worldwide collaboration agreement with merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development and commercialization of stimuvax 
our pipeline of clinical and preclinical stage proprietary small molecule product candidates includes px  px and 
table of contents px and was acquired by us in october from prolx pharmaceuticals corporation  or prolx 
the most advanced of our small molecule candidates are px  which is currently in phase development for pancreatic cancer  and px for which we initiated a phase clinical trial in advanced metastatic cancer in august in addition to our product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology that we may develop ourselves and or license to others 
in  we entered into exclusive supply and collaboration agreements with merck kgaa to develop and market stimuvax  subject to certain development and co promotion rights we retained 
in connection with entering into these agreements  merck kgaa made an equity investment in us in  was obligated to make additional cash payments  generally contingent on satisfaction of specified milestones  and to pay us a royalty on stimuvax sales  if any 
in august  we announced that we restructured our agreements with merck kgaa such that merck kgaa would fully assume responsibility for the further clinical development and marketing of stimuvax 
under the restated agreements  we converted the us and canadian co promotion interest to a specified royalty rate  which is higher than the rate merck kgaa had agreed to pay in markets outside of north america under the original agreements 
the restated agreements also contain development and sales based milestone payments as well as revised payments related to manufacturing scale up and process transfer 
under the revised agreements  we retained responsibility for the manufacture of stimuvax  including process development and scale up for commercial manufacturing 
the signing of the amended agreements also triggered a milestone payment to us of million  before associated payments to third parties of million  which was received in september in december  we announced that we had completed the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to stimuvax to merck kgaa triggering a payment to us of million 
merck kgaa will exclusively purchase stimuvax from us  with respect to purchases for commercial sales  the purchase price will be subtracted from our royalty 
px  our most advanced small molecule compound  is currently in phase clinical evaluation for pancreatic cancer 
in august  we initiated a phase trial of px in patients with advanced metastatic cancer 
our remaining small molecule compounds are in the preclinical development stage 
we acquired these small molecule compounds in october through the acquisition of prolx 
we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization  and manufacturing rights 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of our cancer products and technologies  the selection and preclinical testing of product candidates  and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies 
we have not developed a therapeutic product to the commercial stage 
as a result  our revenue has been limited to date  and we do not expect to recognize any material revenue for the foreseeable future 
our near term prospects will depend significantly on the development of stimuvax and our small molecule compounds 
in particular  our ability to generate revenue in future periods will depend substantially on the progress of ongoing clinical trials for stimuvax and our small molecule compounds  our ability to obtain development and commercialization partners for our small molecule compounds  merck kgaa s success in obtaining regulatory approval for stimuvax  our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our small molecule compounds  and merck kgaa s and our respective abilities to establish commercial markets for these drugs 
any adverse clinical results relating to stimuvax or any decision by merck kgaa to discontinue its efforts to develop and commercialize the product would have a material and adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our small molecule compounds are much earlier in the development stage than stimuvax  and we do not expect to realize any revenues associated with the commercialization of our products for the foreseeable future 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking 
table of contents regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue the development of our product candidates 
we expect expenditures associated with stimuvax to be substantially offset by payments from merck kgaa 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
we recognized net losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our fiscal losses included million attributable to the acquisition of in process research and development and the subsequent expensing thereof 
we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our research and development activities with respect to our small molecules and processes for commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
to date we have funded our operations principally through the sale of our equity securities  cash received through our strategic alliance with merck kgaa  government grants  debt financings  and equipment financings 
we completed our most recent financing in december  raising approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock and the issuance of warrants 
because we have limited revenues and substantial research and development and operating expenses  we expect that we will in the future seek additional working capital funding from the sale of equity or debt securities 
our predecessor corporation  biomira inc  a canadian corporation  or biomira  listed its common shares on the toronto stock exchange in july in connection with its initial public offering 
in december  biomira listed its securities for trading on the nasdaq global market 
until december   biomira s shares traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol biom in us dollars and on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol bra in canadian dollars 
on december   we became the successor corporation to biomira by way of a plan of arrangement effected pursuant to canadian law 
on december   our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the symbol onty in us dollars and on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol ony in canadian dollars 
in addition  pursuant to the plan of arrangement  shareholders of the former biomira received one share of our common stock for each six common shares of biomira that they held 
for years presented prior to  this management s discussion and analysis and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december  have been prepared after giving effect to the for share exchange implemented in connection with the plan of arrangement 
the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis have been prepared using us dollars as the reporting currency 
revenue and expenses revenue our historical revenue has been derived from our contract research and development activities  payments under our collaborative agreements  and miscellaneous licensing  royalty and other revenues from ancillary business and operating activities 
in addition  in connection with entering into the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax with merck kgaa  we retained responsibility for the manufacture of stimuvax and merck kgaa agreed to exclusively purchase stimuvax from us 
as a result  our financial reporting from the date of the signed amended agreements reflects the revenue related to the supply of stimuvax separately as contract manufacturing revenue 
previously  these amounts were reported under contract research and development revenue 
our collaboration with merck kgaa has contributed the substantial majority of our revenue  accounting for   and of total revenue in the years ended december    and  respectively 
contract research and development 
contract research and development revenue represents merck kgaa s contribution toward shared costs associated with stimuvax clinical trials  clinical trial material provided to merck kgaa related to stimuvax  and for fiscal  shared costs and clinical trial material relating to theratope 
during  merck kgaa cancelled our collaboration with respect to theratope  and the remaining contract research and development revenue that was recognized related to reimbursements for non recurring fixed costs associated with the theratope collaboration 
effective march   we transitioned 
table of contents responsibility for all stimuvax clinical development and regulatory activities to and the related costs thereon to merck kgaa 
in january  merck kgaa initiated a global phase clinical trial under our collaboration assessing the efficacy and safety of stimuvax as a potential treatment for inoperable non small cell lung cancer 
we expect the clinical trial to include approximately  patients in approximately countries 
because of the change in our responsibilities for stimuvax clinical trials  our contract research and development revenue has been recently reduced as we no longer receive reimbursements for shared clinical trial costs 
contract manufacturing 
our contract manufacturing revenue represents amounts that were previously reported as reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs as contract research development revenue 
as a result of our amended and restated agreements with merck kgaa and the fact that we are now responsible for supplying merck kgaa with supplies of stimuvax  our financial reporting from the date of the signed agreements reflects the revenue for the supply of stimuvax as contract manufacturing revenue 
previously  these amounts were reported under contract research and development revenue 
we expect revenue associated with this activity to increase in future periods as patient enrollment increases in the phase clinical trial that merck kgaa is currently conducting for stimuvax 
licensing revenue from collaborative agreements 
licensing revenue from collaborative agreements represents the amortization over a ten year period of upfront payments received under our agreements with merck kgaa as well as amortization of other payments made upon achievement of development milestones relating to signing of the agreements  transfers of know how  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  and commercial development of stimuvax 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue relates to contract manufacturing activities utilizing our various patented technologies and compounds for external customers 
expenses research and development manufacturing 
research and development manufacturing expense consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
these expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  technology access and licensing fees related to the use of proprietary third party technologies  employee and consultant related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation expense  benefits  and related costs  and third party supplier expenses 
to date  we have recognized research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  as they have been incurred 
we do not expect to defer and amortize any research and development expenses unless and until technical and market viability of the associated technologies has been established 
we credit funding received from government research and development grants against research and development expense 
these credits totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these grants were small business innovation research  or sbir  grants that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of prolx on october  we expect to receive an additional million during the remaining grant term and a further million may be available upon application 
we received no government grants eligible for credit against research and development expense in the year ended december  the majority of our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
for example  merck kgaa cancelled our collaboration relating to theratope only after receiving phase clinical trial results 
we had made substantial investments over several years in the development of theratope and terminated all development activities following the cancellation of our collaboration 
similarly  any of our continuing product candidates may be found to be ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial 
table of contents quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative agreements with larger third party pharmaceutical companies to complete the development and commercialization of our small molecule or other product candidates  and it is unknown whether or on what terms we will be able to secure collaboration arrangements for any candidate 
in addition  it is difficult to provide the impact of collaboration arrangements  if any  on the development of product candidates 
establishing collaborative product development relationships with large pharmaceutical companies may or may not accelerate the time to completion or reduce our costs with respect to the development and commercialization of any product candidate 
as a result of these uncertainties and the other risks inherent in the drug development process  we cannot determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of any of our product candidates 
similarly  we cannot determine when  if  or to what extent we may generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate 
the timeframe for development of any product candidate  associated development costs  and the probability of regulatory and commercial success vary widely 
as a result  other than with respect to stimuvax  which is subject to our obligations under the agreements with merck kgaa  we continually evaluate our product candidates and make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to specific candidates 
these determinations are typically made based on consideration of numerous factors  including our evaluation of scientific and clinical trial data and an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial prospects 
we anticipate that we will continue to develop our portfolio of product candidates  which will increase our research and development expense in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
as of the date of the amended collaboration and supply agreements with merck kgaa  we began to report costs associated with manufacturing stimuvax as manufacturing expense 
previously  these amounts were aggregated with other research and development expenses and reported as one line item 
we expect manufacturing expense associated with this activity to increase in future periods as patient enrollment increases in the phase clinical trial merck kgaa is currently conducting for stimuvax 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  and accounting services 
marketing and business development 
marketing and business development expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for marketing and business development personnel  including travel costs  research subscriptions  and other marketing administrative costs 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists of depreciation of the cost of plant and equipment such as scientific  office  manufacturing  and computer equipment as well as depreciation of leasehold improvements 
in process research and development 
in process research and development expense relates to the portfolio of oncology products we acquired in connection with the acquisition of prolx 
these technologies require regulatory approval to be commercialized and  in the absence of such regulatory approval  have no proven alternative future use 
consequently  we expensed their fair value at the time of the acquisition 
during the year ended december   we recognized in process research and development expenses of million in connection with the prolx acquisition 
investment and other income 
investment and other income consists of interest and other income on our cash and short term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses 
our short term investments consist of canadian or us federal  state  or provincial debt securities  investment grade corporate debt securities and commercial paper  and term deposits or similar instruments of trust companies and banks  all with original maturities of between days and one year at the time of purchase 
our short term investments and cash balances are denominated in either united states dollars or canadian dollars  and the relative weighting between united states dollars and canadian dollars will vary from time to time based on market conditions 
table of contents and our operating requirements in the two countries 
we have historically not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to our us and canadian dollars investment assets or cash balances 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest payments under capital lease agreements for computer equipment 
change in fair value of warrants 
change in fair value of warrants relates to outstanding warrants to acquire shares of common stock 
the exercise price of the warrants are denominated in united states dollars share purchase warrants with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than our functional currency  which  prior to january   was the canadian dollar  are recorded as liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are then reflected in our statement of operations 
income tax recovery 
income tax recovery relates to the proceeds realized from the sale of new jersey state tax losses attributable to our us subsidiary operating in the state of new jersey 
with the closing in december of our new jersey operations  we will no longer be eligible to sell our tax losses 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been included in this report beginning on page f and which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  stock based compensation  changes in fair value of warrants  and foreign currency translation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values when there is reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of the arrangement  otherwise  consideration is allocated based on the residual value method 
the applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied to each of the separate units 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when earned 

table of contents revenue from our collaboration with merck kgaa is recognized as follows up front fees and license fees 
up front fees and license fees received in connection with our agreements with merck kgaa are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement or related product life cycle  whichever is shorter 
milestones 
milestone payments under our agreements with merck kgaa are recognized as revenue upon performance of obligations or satisfaction of conditions defined as milestones in the agreements  assuming we have no further involvement or obligation to perform with respect to the milestone under our agreements with merck kgaa 
milestone payments for which we have ongoing involvement or obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated period of our ongoing involvement or performance of our obligation 
contract research funding and contract manufacturing 
effective march   we transitioned responsibility for the clinical development and regulatory activities for stimuvax to merck kgaa 
prior to march   we were responsible for clinical research and development costs related to obtaining regulatory approval in north america  and merck kgaa and we agreed to equal co funding of the eligible costs 
we recognized these reimbursed costs as revenue in the same period the costs were incurred 
subsequent to march   we have continued to receive cost reimbursements from merck kgaa related to transition activities and the supply of clinical trial material 
the reimbursed transition costs are recognized as revenue in the same period the costs are incurred 
the reimbursed clinical trial material costs are recognized as contract manufacturing revenue after the earlier of the expiration of a day return period or formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by merck kgaa 
in august  we signed amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax with merck kgaa 
under the terms of the amended agreements  we have retained responsibility for the manufacture stimuvax and merck kgaa has agreed to exclusively purchase stimuvax from oncothyreon 
the amended agreements transform what were previously reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs to a long term contract manufacturing arrangement 
our financial reporting from the date of the signed amended agreements reflects the revenue and associated clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax separately in the consolidated statements of operations as contract manufacturing revenue and manufacturing expense  respectively 
previously  these amounts were reported under contract research and development revenue and research and development expense  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenue is recognized after shipment of the clinical trial material to merck kgaa and upon the earlier of the expiration of a day return period or formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by merck kgaa 
the associated costs of the clinical trial material is removed from inventory and recorded as manufacturing expense at the same time the contract manufacturing revenue is recognized 
royalties 
royalties based on reported sales of licensed products  if any  will be recognized based on the terms of our agreements with merck kgaa when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not recognized any royalty revenues from product sales under our agreements with merck kgaa 
stock based compensation we maintain an amended and restated share option plan under which an aggregate of  common shares were subject to outstanding options as of december  and an aggregate of  common shares were available for future issuance 
we have generally granted options to acquire our common shares to our employees and directors under the share option plan  and we have granted restricted stock to non employee directors under the restricted share unit plan 
as required by our plan and the rules of the toronto stock exchange  we have historically granted options to acquire shares of our common shares with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common shares in trading on the toronto stock exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
in cases where our board of directors approved grants during a closed trading window under our insider trading policy  however  our board of directors fixed the exercise price based on the closing price of our common shares in toronto stock exchange trading on the first 
table of contents trading day after our trading window opened 
to date  the exercise price for all our stock option grants has been established based on our functional currency  the canadian dollar 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 or fin  and we adopted the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas for stock options granted during fiscal and fiscal  we determined the fair value at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method for purposes of our pro forma disclosures under sfas under apb and associated interpretations  we were required to record as compensation expense the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the stock on the date the stock option was granted over the applicable option exercise price 
during fiscal  we recorded no compensation expense under apb as all options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas r only to awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we also evaluated the need to record a cumulative effect adjustment for estimated forfeitures upon the adoption of sfas r and determined that no adjustment was required 
for stock based compensation accounted for under sfas r  we determined the estimated fair value of our common shares at the time of grant based on the closing price of our common shares in trading on the toronto stock exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the date the board of directors approved the stock option  unless the applicable exercise price was established on a date after board approval  in which case we have used the closing price on the date the exercise price was established 
for purposes of determining the fair value of options granted under sfas r  we determined the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
the following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted year ended year ended december  december  risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend rate expected volatility weighted average grant date fair value per share option cdn cdn

we based the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option on the yield available on government of canada benchmark bonds with an equivalent expected term 
the expected life of options in years represents the period of time stock based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules  historical employee behavior  and expectations concerning future employee behavior 
we determined expected volatility based on a bloomberg weekly report of the volatility of our common shares for a historic period equal to the expected term of the stock option 

table of contents change in fair value of warrants information concerning outstanding warrants to acquire our capital stock as of december  is set forth in the table below 
each of these warrants was issued to investors in connection with private financing transactions  and no market currently exists for any of these warrants 
the exercise price for all of these warrants is denominated in united states dollars

for purposes of determining the fair value of warrants issued under sfas  we used the black scholes option pricing model 
we assumed a zero percent dividend yield 
for purposes of applying the black scholes model  we based the risk free interest rate for the expected term of each warrant on the yield available on government of canada benchmark bonds with an equivalent expected term 
the expected term represents the period of time the warrant is expected to be outstanding  which we estimated based on the contractual term of the warrant and historical exercise experience 
we determined volatility based on a bloomberg weekly report of the volatility of our common shares for a historic period equal to the expected life of the warrant 
foreign currency translation for the fiscal year ended december  and comparative periods presented  our functional currency was the canadian dollar 
as such  revenue and expense transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are translated into canadian dollars at the average exchange rates in effect at the time of such transactions 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates at the balance sheet date 
gains or losses resulting from these translation adjustments are included in other income or expense 
the operations of all of our subsidiaries are considered to be integrated foreign operations and  accordingly  are converted to canadian dollars by translating monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date  non monetary assets and liabilities at the rate in effect when the assets were acquired or liabilities were assumed  and items included in the statements of operations at the average exchange rates in effect at the date of such transactions with resulting exchange gains or losses included in the determination of income 
as our reporting currency is the us dollar  our canadian dollar consolidated financial statements are translated into us dollars 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date while operations and cash flows are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains or losses related to our net assets are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity 
effective january   we changed our functional currency to the us dollar from the canadian dollar to reflect the our migration into the united states effective december   and increasing us dollar denominated revenues and expenditures 
comparatives will not be restated and the change will be accounted for prospectively 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
overview years ended december  change change in millions  except per share amounts revenue expenses in process research and development n m n m change in fair value of warrant liability income tax recovery n m net loss basic and diluted loss per share not meaningful we have continued to experience net losses in each of the years ended december    and our net loss decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  the substantial decrease in our net loss between fiscal to fiscal is attributable in part to the fact that in  we incurred million in in process research and development expense related to the acquisition of prolx in october  and incurred no in process research and development expense in in addition  a reduction in the change in the fair value of warrant liability of million contributed to the smaller net loss in fiscal the balance of our expenses  consisting of research and development  manufacturing  general and administrative  marketing and business development  depreciation  investment and other income  and interest expense have increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in our expenses in is primarily due to legal  accounting and tax advisory fees of million associated with our reincorporation into the united states and certain costs associated with a reduction of administrative staff 
our expenses were also negatively impacted by million attributable to foreign exchange losses 
these negative impacts to our expenses were partially offset by certain positive impacts including lower research and development costs in fiscal our net loss increased from for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  the substantial annual increase in our net loss between fiscal and fiscal is attributable in part to an increase in our expenses  and in part to substantial non cash expenses recognized in fiscal excluding in process research and development expense and the change in fair value of outstanding warrants  our operating expenses  consisting of research and development  general and administrative  marketing and business development  depreciation  investment and other income  and interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we expensed million of in process research and development acquired in connection with the acquisition of prolx 
also contributing to the increase in our expenses were our adoption of sfas r in fiscal and the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  which was our functional currency in each of the fiscal years presented  and increases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar had an adverse effect on our expenses when expressed in us dollars on our consolidated statements of operations 
effective january   the us dollar became both our functional and reporting currency  but we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in canadian dollars associated with our canadian operations and will therefore continue to be subject to foreign currency exchange risks 

table of contents revenue years ended december  change change in millions contract research and development contract manufacturing n m licensing revenues from collaborative agreements licensing  royalties and other revenue not meaningful our contract research and development revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased funding received from merck kgaa associated with stimuvax as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with merck kgaa 
during  we transitioned responsibility for the clinical development and regulatory activities for stimuvax to merck kgaa  which has resulted in reduced contract research and development revenue compared to in august  we signed the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax with merck kgaa 
under the terms of the amended agreements  we have the responsibility of manufacturing stimuvax and merck kgaa has agreed to exclusively purchase stimuvax from us 
the amended agreements transform what were previously reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs to a long term contract manufacturing arrangement 
our financial reporting from the date of the signed amended agreements reflects the revenue and associated clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax separately in the consolidated statements of operations as contract manufacturing revenue and manufacturing expense  respectively 
during  we recognized million in contract manufacturing revenue under the revised agreements with merck kgaa  which partially offset the million reduction in contract research and development revenue described above 
previously  these amounts would have been reflected under contract research and development revenue and research and development expense  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenue is recognized after shipment of the clinical trial material to merck kgaa and upon the earlier of the expiration of a day return period or formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by merck kgaa 
the associated costs of the clinical trial material is removed from inventory and recorded as manufacturing expense at the same time the contract manufacturing revenue is recognized 
in the first quarter of we resumed manufacturing to support the global phase trial of stimuvax and commenced shipments of clinical trial material to merck kgaa in the second quarter of our contract research and development revenue increased by from million to million from fiscal to of the million increase between fiscal and fiscal  million was attributable to increased reimbursements from merck kgaa associated with the commercial development of stimuvax  offset in part by loss of reimbursements associated with theratope when merck kgaa cancelled our theratope collaboration in early we recognized million in contract research and development revenue associated with theratope in fiscal relating to non recurring fixed costs for which we received a lump sum payment from merck kgaa in we accounted for this payment as deferred revenue and recognized the revenue as associated costs were incurred through to september beginning in the second quarter of  we commenced a second phase safety study for stimuvax  and in february  merck kgaa enrolled the first patient in a phase study  each of which contributed to the increased contract research and development revenues during and our licensing revenue from collaborative agreements increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in february  we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in a global phase trial of stimuvax which triggered a cash milestone payment to us from merck kgaa of million before associated payments to third parties of million 
in august  we announced the signing of the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements 
table of contents related to stimuvax with merck kgaa which triggered an additional cash milestone payment to us from merck kgaa of million before associated payments to third parties of million

we have recorded these milestone payments as deferred revenue and are recognizing the payments as revenue ratably over the remaining patent life of the stimuvax product of approximately years 
as a result  our licensing revenue from collaborative agreements increased in compared to between fiscal and fiscal  licensing revenue from collaborative agreements remained unchanged 
the million of licensing revenue from collaborative agreements recognized in both fiscal and represents amortization of the up front fee attributable to stimuvax over the ten year period

as noted previously under the discussion of revenues  effective with the signing of the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax  clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax to merck kgaa have been presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations as manufacturing expense 
previously  these costs were reported under research and development expenses 
as a result  the decrease in research and development expense from to was primarily attributable to the change in our business relationship with merck kgaa reflected in the amended agreements 
research and development expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the million decrease in research and development expense from to was attributable to reductions in our research and development expense following the march transfer to merck kgaa of clinical development and regulatory approval responsibility for stimuvax  offset in part by million of stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas r on january  and million of costs associated with a workforce reduction we implemented in we incur a portion of our research and development expense  particularly relating to salaries and benefits  in canadian dollars 
during the period from january  to december   the canadian dollar appreciated substantially against the united states dollars  which has the effect of increasing our costs when reported in us dollars 
although we adopted the us dollar as our functional currency effective january   we will continue to incur substantial expenses  including research and development expenses  in canadian dollars and will remain subject to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents general and administrative years ended december  change change in millions general and administrative our general and administrative expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expense from to is primarily attributable to legal  accounting and tax advisory professional fees and costs associated with our reincorporation in delaware  which totaled million

the amended agreements transform what were previously reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs to a long term contract manufacturing arrangement 
our financial reporting from the date of the signed amended agreements reflects the revenue and associated clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax separately in the consolidated statements of operations as contract manufacturing revenue and manufacturing expense  respectively

the net decrease reflects operating expenditures of million in offset by million in cash received under our collaborative and contract manufacturing agreements  million used in payment of accrued business acquisition and share issuance costs  and million used in the purchase of plant and equipment

we believe that our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with milestone payments we currently anticipate receiving from merck kgaa under our collaboration agreements  will be sufficient to finance our operations into the second quarter of nevertheless  we expect that we will require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to continue the development of products in our pipeline and to expand our product portfolio 
we would expect to seek additional financing from the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities  and we cannot predict that financing will be available when and as we need financing or that  if available  that the financing terms will be commercially reasonable 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if we require  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing shareholders could experience substantial dilution
