item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the united states and united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  malaysia and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at wal mart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
worldwide oil prices were higher in than in  while the average price for north american natural gas was up only slightly in compared to the average price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil in was  an increase of compared to the nymex natural gas price in averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu  up from changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the company in if the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company had net income in of million  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per diluted share 
in the company s net income was million  per diluted share 
the net income improvement in compared to primarily related to higher earnings generated by both the exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses 
the net cost of corporate activities was higher  however  in than in the lower net income in compared to was caused by a combination of lower earnings in the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing operations and higher net costs for corporate activities 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
income from continuing operations was million  per diluted share  in  million  per diluted share  in  and million  per diluted share  in income from discontinued operations was million  per diluted share  in there were no results from discontinued operations in and in the second quarter the company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western canada for cash proceeds of million  which generated an after tax gain on the sale of million in income from discontinued operations in related to a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale of the western canada properties in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the favorable tax adjustment associated with the sale in has been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  as explained in note p to the consolidated financial statements  net income in and all prior years have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  in consequently  net income in and as presented above increased by million 
per diluted share and million 
per diluted share  respectively  from the amounts previously reported 
vs 
net income in was million  per diluted share  compared to million  per diluted share  in the improvement in consolidated net income in of million compared to was primarily related to higher earnings in both major businesses exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m or downstream 
the net costs of corporate activities were higher in and partially offset the improved results in e p and r m 
earnings in the e p business improved by million in as this business benefited from higher oil sales prices  lower exploration expenses and lower income taxes in compared to e p earnings were adversely affected in by lower sales volumes for oil and natural gas and slightly lower realized natural gas sales prices as well as higher expenses for production  depreciation  depletion and administration 
the r m business generated record company profits in  increasing million compared to the improvement was primarily due to stronger us refining margins in compared to 
table of contents  a fully operational refinery at meraux  louisiana  during  and lower hurricane repair expenses in  but r m earnings in included an unfavorable impact from noncash inventory revaluations 
the meraux refinery was shut down for repairs for the first five months of following significant damage caused by hurricane katrina in late august the company incurred significant repair costs in at meraux following hurricane katrina  certain of which were not recoverable through insurance policies 
in the uk  the company acquired the remaining interest in the milford haven  wales  refinery in late under the company s last in first out accounting policy for inventory  an after tax noncash charge of million was recorded in to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices  which were significantly lower than at the end of the year 
the net costs of corporate activities increased by million in compared to  with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher net interest expense and higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the higher net interest expense was caused by higher average borrowing levels  partially offset by a higher level of interest costs capitalized to e p development projects 
the us dollar generally weakened against other significant foreign currencies used in the company s business in  especially compared to the canadian dollar 
the period included lower corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense in for an educational assistance contribution commitment 
sales and other operating revenues were billion higher in than in mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices for gasoline and other refined products  higher sales prices for crude oil produced by the company  and higher sales volumes for merchandise at retail gasoline stations 
sales volumes for oil and natural gas were lower in than in gain loss on sales of assets in was million unfavorable to as the company had no major asset sales in interest and other income was lower by million in due mostly to higher losses on foreign currency exchange attributable to a continued weakening of the us dollar against the primary foreign currencies affecting the company s operations  which include the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling  the euro and the malaysian ringgit 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the company s refineries  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations 
the higher crude oil purchase volumes in were caused by the meraux refinery being operational throughout following about five months of downtime in for hurricane related repairs 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to and included higher refinery and retail station costs  higher workover and repair costs for gulf of mexico oil and gas fields  and higher costs for oil and gas field operations in malaysia  the uk and ecuador and for synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
exploration expenses were million lower in than in primarily associated with less dry hole and geophysical expenses in malaysia  but partially offset by higher costs in canada for dry holes  geophysical  lease amortization and settlement of two work commitments on the scotian shelf 
selling and general expenses were million higher in than in as higher compensation  insurance and berkana energy administrative costs in the just completed year were almost offset by lower costs associated with an educational assistance program called the el dorado promise 
the company acquired of berkana energy in december  and subsequently sold this investment in january depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million higher in compared to due mostly to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all e p segments and higher depreciation for the meraux refinery and retail gasoline stations 
impairment of long lived assets of million in primarily related to closing underperforming gasoline stations in the us and canada 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in mostly due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as additional kikeh development wells were drilled during the year  and higher anticipated future abandonment costs on existing wells in the us net costs associated with hurricanes was lower in by million mostly due to uninsured repair costs incurred in at the meraux refinery following hurricane katrina in the costs recorded in related to a downward adjustment for anticipated insurance recoveries at the meraux refinery based on recently updated loss limits published by the company s primary property insurer 
interest expense increased by million in mostly associated with a higher average level of outstanding borrowings during the year compared to the amount of interest costs capitalized to property  plant and equipment increased by million in due to higher levels of spending on e p development projects in malaysia  the us and the republic of congo 
minority interest in operations of berkana energy in canada was favorable million in compared to income tax expense was million higher in than in and was mainly attributable to higher pretax income levels 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings rose from in to in the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain 
the tax rates in both years benefitted  however  from overall favorable effects of tax rate changes in foreign countries 
vs 
net income in was million  per diluted share  compared to million  per diluted share  in net income in included income from discontinued operations of million  which was per share 
the million decline in net income in was primarily due to lower earnings in both the company s e p and downstream businesses  plus higher net costs for corporate activities 
the company s e p earnings declined by million in due to several factors  including an after tax gain of million in related to a sale of most mature oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico  plus in  lower sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas caused by lower production levels for these products  lower natural gas sales prices in north america and higher production and administrative expenses 
the e p results were favorably impacted by higher crude oil sales prices  lower exploration expenses  lower hurricane related costs and higher income tax benefits due to various tax rate changes 
company wide  the net costs associated with hurricanes were million higher in compared to hurricane costs in the company s r m business were million higher in due to more uninsured costs associated with repairs at the meraux  louisiana refinery  clean up of a crude oil spill that occurred at the refinery as a result of damages from hurricane katrina  and settlement of litigation associated 
table of contents with the oil spill 
hurricane costs in the company s e p business were lower in by million due to lower costs for equipment and facilities repair  discretionary employee assistance and hurricane related insurance 
earnings in the r m business were million lower in compared to  with the earnings reduction primarily caused by the aforementioned higher hurricane related costs 
excluding the higher hurricane costs  us downstream earnings improved in compared to  while earnings for downstream operations in the uk were down million from record levels in the company continued to expand its retail gasoline station business by adding sites in  with virtually all such additions located at wal mart supercenters 
the net costs of corporate activities were million higher in than these costs increased mostly due to an educational assistance contribution commitment amounting to million after tax  plus the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange movements as the us dollar weakened against most other major currencies used by the company s operations  including the british pound sterling and euro 
in addition  corporate activity costs in were unfavorable because included income tax benefits of million from settlement of us income tax audits 
sales and other operating revenues in were billion higher than in mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices in the latter year for refined petroleum products 
in addition  merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations increased in and the sales price of crude oil was higher in revenue was unfavorably affected in by lower sales volumes of crude oil and lower sales volumes and prices for natural gas 
gain on sale of assets before income taxes amounted to million in compared to million in the prior year included a pretax gain of million related to the sale of oil and natural gas properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf 
interest and other income in was unfavorable to the prior year by million due mostly to higher foreign exchange charges associated with the unfavorable effects of the us dollar weakening against the british pound sterling and euro 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at these gasoline stations 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower volumes of crude oil purchased for feedstock in because the meraux refinery was off line for repairs for the first five months of the year 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to due to higher repairs and other production expenses in the company s e p operations  higher costs to operate retail gasoline stations primarily due to more stations in operation  and higher refinery operating costs mostly associated with increased labor costs at the company s meraux refinery 
exploration expenses were lower in compared to by million primarily due to lower dry hole charges in the current year in the republic of congo  but partially offset by higher dry hole and seismic and geophysical costs in the us selling and general expenses increased million in due to various factors during the year  including costs for an educational assistance contribution commitment  the costs of reorganizing the company s us e p operations  higher costs for professional consultants  and the initial costs to expense the grant date fair value of stock options which began in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million lower in than generally due to lower volumes of crude oil and natural gas sold by the company s e p business 
depreciation expense in the downstream business was higher in mostly due to the continued addition of retail gasoline stations in the us accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in mostly due to higher asset retirement obligations for malaysian operations associated with drilling development wells at the kikeh field during the year 
the reasons for higher costs associated with hurricanes in were included in the previous paragraph 
interest expense increased in by million due to higher average borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the amount of interest costs capitalized to development projects increased by million in compared to due to higher capitalized costs associated with the kikeh field  offshore sabah malaysia  and a field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
income tax expense in was lower than in by million due to lower pretax earnings in and net tax benefits in the year from changes in tax rates in various taxing jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings in was and included a net benefit of million from the reduction of federal and provincial tax rates in canada offset in part by an increase in the tax rate on oil operations in the uk the effective tax rate in was of consolidated pretax earnings 
the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain 

table of contents segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment 
more detailed reviews of operating results for the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table 
millions of dollars exploration and production united states canada united kingdom malaysia ecuador other refining and marketing north america united kingdom corporate and other income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income exploration and production earnings from exploration and production operations were million in  million in and million in e p earnings improved in compared to primarily due to higher average realized oil sales prices for the company s production 
in addition  exploration expenses were lower by million in both years were favorably affected by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in foreign countries 
the results were unfavorably impacted compared to by lower oil and natural gas sales volumes  lower realized natural gas sales prices in north america and higher expenses for production  depreciation  depletion  administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities 
crude oil sales volumes in were lower than in  despite a increase in crude oil production in compared to the lower sales volumes were caused by the timing of sale transactions as the company had a larger inventory of unsold crude oil at year end compared to a year earlier 
the increase in crude oil inventory  which is primarily at the kikeh field in malaysia  is expected to return to normal levels during during  lower oil sales volumes in the us and ecuador were only partially offset by higher oil sales volumes in malaysia and canada 
the lower sales volumes in the us were due to field declines in the gulf of mexico  while lower sales volumes in ecuador were caused by make up sales volumes in that related to a prior year 
higher oil sales volumes in malaysia were mostly caused by start up of the significant kikeh field  offshore sabah  in august  partially offset by lower production at the west patricia field  offshore sarawak 
higher volumes in canada were attributable to better production volumes at the terra nova field in the jeanne d arc basin  offshore newfoundland  which was shut in for repairs for about six months in natural gas sales volumes were lower in than and the reduction was mostly due to field declines for maturing fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana as well as lower natural gas production at uk north sea fields 
the company s average realized oil sales price was higher in than  while the average north american natural gas sales price was lower in the million reduction in earnings compared to was mostly attributable to lower production of crude oil and natural gas  which led to lower sales volumes for these products 
lower natural gas sales prices and higher production and administrative expenses in and a million after tax gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico in also were factors that led to lower e p earnings in e p earnings in were favorably impacted by higher realized oil sales prices  lower exploration expenses  lower hurricane related expenses and income tax benefits associated with tax rate changes enacted during the year 
crude oil sales volumes were down in by compared to  while natural gas sales volumes were down by 
oil sales volumes were lower in primarily due to lower production at maturing fields in the gulf of mexico  lower production at the terra nova field  offshore newfoundland  due to the field being shut in for six months for major equipment repairs  and lower production at west patricia  offshore sarawak malaysia  due to a lower volumetric sharing percentage allocable to the company under the production sharing contract as the field matures 
the decline in natural gas sales volumes in was attributable to both the mid sale of mature gas properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf and lower production from gas fields onshore south louisiana 
the company s average worldwide realized crude oil sales price increased in  while the average realized sales price for north american natural gas decreased

table of contents a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas malaysia crude oil ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in in  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquid production increased by  barrels per day  or  primarily due to start up in august of the kikeh field in block k  offshore sabah  malaysia 
this prolific field came on only five years after discovery 
kikeh produced  barrels of oil per day for the full year and almost  barrels per day in december this field will continue to ramp up production during as more wells are brought on production 
oil production also increased in at terra nova  offshore eastern canada  at syncrude in alberta  and in ecuador 
oil volumes declined in at most other areas  including the us and at hibernia  west patricia  the uk north sea and the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb 
terra nova produced throughout after being off line for major equipment repairs for six months in total production at terra nova was  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in syncrude production totaled  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in the production increase at syncrude was mostly attributable to a third coker unit that started up during oil production totaled  barrels per day at block in ecuador  up barrels per day due to a more significant development drilling campaign in oil production declined in the us from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction was due to declines at various maturing fields in the gulf of mexico 
heavy oil production in the wcsb fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  primarily due to a slower development drilling program for non operated fields in alberta 
oil production at hibernia  offshore newfoundland  was  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in the hibernia field is experiencing production decline 
oil production in the uk was down from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the reduction caused by declining production at the company s primary fields in the north sea 
the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  had net production of  barrels per day in after production levels of  barrels per day in west patricia is also experiencing declining production along with an increased government take under the production sharing contract 
production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids was lower in compared to primarily due to lower volumes produced in the us gulf of mexico and offshore eastern canada 
us oil production of  barrels per day in was down by from levels 
the reduction in the us related to lower volumes at deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico and oil volumes produced in from fields on the continental shelf that were sold in the middle of that year 
us oil production in was virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes  while volumes were adversely affected by downtime associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
terra nova  offshore eastern canada  was off production for about one half of for major equipment repairs 
the floating production  storage and offloading vessel was taken to europe for turnaround and production restarted in mid november production at terra nova was  barrels per day in  down from levels 
production at hibernia totaled  barrels per day  which was below  with the decline due primarily to more downtime for equipment reliability issues in total heavy oil production in wcsb increased in and totaled  barrels per day 
this increase was attributable to an ongoing development drilling program during at the seal field in alberta 
light oil production in the wcsb fell to barrels per day in mostly due to less condensate produced at the rimbey gas field in alberta 
synthetic oil production at syncrude increased in and was  barrels per day 
a third coker unit was started up during  and the new unit permits a larger volume of bitumen to be processed at the plant 
the new coker experienced various start up issues  but was operating near capacity at year end all oil production in malaysia during came from the west patricia and adjoining congkak fields in block sk offshore sarawak 
net oil production from malaysia was  barrels per day in  lower than in as the production sharing contract allocates a smaller portion of gross production to the company s account in both a higher price environment and as prior costs are recovered 
gross production volumes at the malaysian fields fell only in oil production offshore the united kingdom fell to  barrels per day 
the most significant uk decline in occurred at the schiehallion field and was primarily caused by a fire at the facilities used by this field 
total net oil produced at block in ecuador was  barrels per day in 
table of contents  a increase from as a development drilling campaign continued in oil sales volumes in ecuador significantly exceeded production in due to selling  barrels of oil in settlement of a dispute with partners over oil production that was originally withheld from the company 
worldwide sales of natural gas were million cubic feet mmcf per day in  million in and million in natural gas sales in the united states fell in and averaged mmcf per day 
the decline of mmcf per day in was due to declines at various fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
natural gas sales volumes in increased in canada and averaged mmcf per day 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk fell in and averaged mmcf per day 
the lower uk gas sales volumes were attributable to lower gas volumes sold from two oil fields in the north sea 
sales of natural gas in the united states were mmcf per day in  down from the reduced us natural gas sales volume in was attributable to a combination of lower volumes produced onshore south louisiana due to field decline and no volumes produced in at gulf of mexico continental shelf fields that were sold in mid in the gulf of mexico  production at a new field that came onstream in served to essentially offset lower volumes at other deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
us natural gas sales volumes in were virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes  while volumes in were adversely affected by downtime associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
natural gas sales volumes in canada of mmcf per day in were lower than  mostly caused by normal field decline in the rimbey area 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk in were mmcf per day  lower than in the decline for natural gas sales volumes in the uk was wholly attributable to make up gas volumes sold in at an offshore field in order to balance under sold production in earlier years 
excluding the make up volumes in  uk natural gas sales volumes in would have exceeded amounts 
worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years due to the combination of a strong world economy  real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels  and effective production output controls by opec producers 
the company s average realized sales price across all of its oil production was per barrel in  up from the average of per barrel 
in the us  the company realized an average price of per barrel  up from the average sales price for heavy oil produced in canada was per barrel  higher than in hibernia and terra nova sales prices averaged and per barrel  respectively  during  which were increases of and 
synthetic oil production sold for per barrel  up from a year earlier 
uk oil prices increased to per barrel in in malaysia  oil produced at the west patricia field sold for more in than in  with an average of for the just completed year 
the kikeh field came on stream in august and all sales from this field occurred in the stronger price environment during the fourth quarter at an average of per barrel 
the average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the ecuadorian government for block oil was per barrel  an increase of from for most of the year  the government received a share of realized sales prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalates with the monthly us consumer price index 
however  in mid october the government changed its share of such revenue from to 
at year end  the benchmark oil price for block was approximately per barrel 
the company and its partners in block intend to initiate arbitration proceedings claiming that the government does not have the right under the contract to change this sharing arrangement 
the company realized an average per barrel sales price of for crude oil and condensate in  up from the average of per barrel 
the average realized oil sales price in in the us was up at per barrel 
the average sales price of canadian heavy oil was per barrel  also a increase compared to realized average prices per barrel for hibernia and terra nova oil sales in were and  respectively  with each up about from averages 
synthetic oil production was sold at per barrel in  up from prices 
the realized sales price for synthetic oil did not rise as much as other oil because of higher volumes of similar crudes available in the market for which demand did not keep pace with the growth 
average crude oil prices in malaysia of per barrel in were higher than  while uk prices in rose to per barrel 
the average oil price realized in ecuador of per barrel rose only from as the ecuadorian government passed a revenue sharing law that became effective in april  whereby the government received a revenue share of for realized prices exceeding a benchmark price that escalates with the inflation rate 
the company s north american natural gas sale prices in and did not rise in tandem with higher crude oil prices 
the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices fell in to per thousand cubic feet mcf 
in the uk  the average natural gas price rose to per mcf 
north american gas sales prices averaged per mcf in  down from the average 
the sales price for natural gas in the uk was up and averaged per mcf 
based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 

table of contents production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom malaysia ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil production cost per equivalent barrel increased in the us in mostly due to higher workover and field repairs and lower production volumes 
the rate per equivalent barrel in was up from mostly due to higher insurance costs coupled with lower overall production 
the per unit costs for canadian conventional oil and gas operations  excluding syncrude was lower in than primarily due to higher production levels and lower repair costs at terra nova in the field was shut in for major repairs for six months in canadian costs excluding syncrude rose significantly in due to lower production volumes and higher repair costs at terra nova while off line for major repairs  plus a higher mix of more costly heavy oil production versus lighter oils 
higher production costs per barrel for canadian synthetic oil operations in were primarily due to a higher net profit royalty rate and a higher foreign exchange rate 
in higher costs for synthetic operations were mostly attributable to higher coker repair costs and higher compensation costs 
the higher average uk cost per barrel in was mostly due to higher maintenance costs  lower oil production at the north sea fields and a higher foreign exchange rate 
the higher per unit cost in malaysia in was due to the start up phase for kikeh oil and a lower production level for west patricia 
higher costs per barrel produced in the uk and malaysia were mostly attributable to higher facility maintenance costs 
higher per unit operating costs in ecuador in were primarily caused by increasing water handling costs as block wells mature 
higher per unit operating costs in ecuador in compared to were mostly attributable to higher field operating costs in the amazon region where block is located 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry holes expense was million less in than primarily due to a lower level of exploration drilling activity in with mostly new e p management in  much of the year was spent reevaluating exploration drilling prospects on a worldwide basis 
dry holes expense was million lower in than mostly due to less unsuccessful wildcat drilling in the republic of congo  but partially offset by higher unsuccessful drilling costs in the gulf of mexico 
geological and geophysical g g expenses were million less in than primarily due to lower spending on d seismic in blocks sk and h  and lower geophysical analyses on pm blocks  all in malaysia 
the lower malaysian costs were partially offset by higher seismic costs in in the gulf of mexico and offshore australia  and higher geophysical studies offshore the republic of congo 
g g expenses in were about level with as higher costs in the gulf of mexico were essentially offset by lower spending offshore eastern canada 
other exploration expenses in were million higher than mostly due to a million settlement of unfulfilled work commitments on two expiring scotian shelf leases 
other exploration expenses in were million higher than in mostly due to higher administrative costs for international exploration activities 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to primarily due to amortization of land acquisitions at the tupper property in northeast british columbia 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense in was virtually flat with a million charge for asset impairment in was taken to write down an unused e p administrative office to its estimated fair value 
costs of million and million were incurred in and  respectively  in the company s exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
these costs were related to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  and also included in discretionary assistance to employees in the new orleans area after hurricane katrina 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in compared to was caused by generally higher per unit rates for development capital  the start up of the kikeh field  and an increase in foreign exchange rates in canada and the uk the million reduction in compared to was attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales volumes  partially offset by generally higher per barrel capital amortization caused by higher costs for development operations and negative us reserve revisions 
the company continues to experience high drilling and related costs caused by a strong demand for such services 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the higher accretion costs in were mostly related to higher estimated future abandonment costs for facilities and wells in the gulf of mexico and future abandonment obligations related to additional development wells drilled in the kikeh field in the higher accretion costs incurred in were also mostly associated with development wells drilled at the kikeh field in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was in  in and in both and included net tax benefits due to enacted changes in foreign tax rates 
canada lowered federal tax rates in both years and in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan also lowered tax rates 
the net benefit from these canadian tax rate reductions  which effectively reduced recorded deferred tax liabilities was million in and million in a uk tax rate increase from to on oil and gas profits in increased taxes in the prior year by million 
the effective tax rate in was slightly below the us statutory tax rate of primarily due to the enacted canadian tax rate reduction during the year 
the effective tax rate was lower than in mostly due to the charge in related to the uk tax rate increase 
a benefit for a charitable building donation based on fair value reduced us taxes by million in also in  the company incurred lower exploration and other expenses in tax jurisdictions where tax relief is currently not available 
these tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in malaysia  the republic of congo and indonesia 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently ring fenced and no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for blocks h  p  l and m  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
although the effective tax rate was only slightly higher than the us statutory tax rate of  the annual rate was lower than in mostly due to net benefits from the aforementioned tax rate changes 
the effective tax rate in was higher than the average us statutory rate due to unrecognized income tax benefits on certain exploration and other expenses in malaysia and the republic of congo 
at december   approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
virtually all of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s various deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
further drilling  facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed 
in block k malaysia  of both oil and natural gas reserves of million barrels and billion cubic feet  respectively  at year end for the kikeh field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and continued development drilling  and of the million barrels of oil reserves at the kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of drilling operations directed by another company 
also in malaysia  there were billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore sarawak at year end  pending completion of development drilling and facilities

a partial sale of the company s working interest in the republic of congo was pending government approval at december  once approved  the company s commitment for field development will be reduced by approximately million 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  and maintains lines of credit with banks 
table of contents and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements

based on its budget  the company anticipates utilizing a significant portion of its long term borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities during the year to fund certain ongoing development projects 
the level of additional borrowings are subject to change based on actual levels of cash flows and capital spending 
at february   the company s long term debt rating by standard poor s was bbb and by moody s investors service was baa 
the company has a rating of a low from dominion bond rating service 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in  to in and to in environmental murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the company s operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the us safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells regulations of the us department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of water discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where murphy operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills 
cercla  commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites 
as discussed below  murphy is involved in a limited number of superfund sites 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous 
rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
the us environmental protection agency epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used 
several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the epa s mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline are effective in and both of the company s us refineries have been expanded and are now capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline 
each of the us refineries must begin to produce the epa required ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd beginning in the meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ulsd for approximately half of its diesel production  but the superior refinery is not yet capable of meeting the ulsd standard 
the company s management is currently studying alternatives available for fully meeting this ulsd standard at meraux and superior 
the energy independence and security act was signed into law in december the act through epa regulation requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
this act greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet its obligation 
world leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions 
as part of these discussions  the kyoto agreement was adopted in that has been ratified by certain countries in which the company operates or may operate in the future  with the united states being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement 
the us may ratify all or a portion of the agreement in 
table of contents the future 
the agreement became effective for ratifying countries in and these countries have implemented regulations or are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents 
the company is unable to predict how final regulations associated with the agreement will impact its costs in future years  but it is reasonable to expect these regulations to increase its compliance costs to some degree 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including three refineries  five terminals  and approximately service stations  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
in addition the company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
the epa currently considers the company to be a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at both superfund sites 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other superfund sites 
the company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
however  based on information currently available to the company  the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december  the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and various industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last several years  prices for oil field goods and services have risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant  and prices could continue to be adversely affected in the future 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services  although the company anticipates escalation in prices for certain equipment and services as long as oil prices remain strong

significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities 
year end prices usually do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of the annual report 
an unfavorable oil reserve revision in the us in was mostly related to poor performance at one deepwater field in the gulf of mexico 
favorable oil reserve revisions in in canada relate primarily to better performance at the hibernia and terra nova fields 
favorable oil revisions in malaysia relate to west patricia and kikeh well performances 
the oil reserve revisions in in the us  canada  malaysia and ecuador were based on performance of various local wells 
the reserve revision in malaysia in was mostly due to extension of proved oil in the kikeh reservoir 
the us oil reserve revision in was mostly due to poor well performance at one deepwater gulf of mexico field 
oil reserve revisions in in canada  the uk and ecuador were due to better field performance  while the malaysia revision was caused by higher oil prices that reduce volumes allocable to the company for cost recovery under production sharing contracts 
downward revisions to us natural gas reserves in and were mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
the favorable natural gas reserve revision in canada in is mostly attributable to well performance at the natural gas field owned by a consolidated 
table of contents subsidiary 
the downward revision to natural gas reserves in malaysia is based on higher contractual sales prices at year end compared to the significant upward revision of natural gas reserves in malaysia in related to gas associated with the kikeh field that will be sold to the local government beginning in the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
costs for one exploration well in progress at year end amounted to million 
in january  the well was determined to have successfully found hydrocarbon deposits and will be further evaluated for commerciality 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
dry hole expense related to wells drilled in a prior year was million in  there were no dry holes in or that were drilled in prior years 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
although the company does not believe it had any significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at december   one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices  significantly lower future production  significantly higher future costs  significantly lower future margins on refining and marketing sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
murphy holds a interest in block ecuador  where the company and its partners produce oil for export 
on october   the government of ecuador enacted into law a levy that increases from to its share of oil sales prices that exceed a threshold reference price that was about per barrel at december  the company and its partners in block intend to initiate 
table of contents arbitration proceedings with an international arbitrator as permitted by its participation contract 
while arbitration proceedings are ongoing the block partners are actively negotiating contractual changes with the ecuadorian government 
should the arbitration  negotiations and other designated security arrangements fail to permit the company to recover its investment  the company could have to record an impairment charge to reduce its investment in block in a future period 
the company s carrying value of fixed assets in ecuador at december  amounted to million 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h  pm  p  l and m in malaysia  exploration licenses in the republic of congo and certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are adjusted as necessary  generally based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds available within each country  and after cash flow analyses are performed to discount projected benefit payment streams 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on higher bond yields during  the company has increased the primary us plans discount rate from in to in and beyond 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in compared to as the effects from a growing employee base may not be fully offset by the effects of a higher discount rate 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 

table of contents contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company has entered into an agreement to lease production facilities for the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the above table 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end includes an operating lease of the kikeh floating  production  storage and offloading vessel fpso  an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract 
the kikeh fpso lease calls for future monthly net lease payments over the next eight years 
the processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
under the contract  the company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility 
if actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through is less than a specified quantity  the company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time 
through  actual production from the medusa field has exceeded the contractual minimum volumes 
the company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the meraux refinery through the contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid 
future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
a strong global economy  which fueled demand for energy  led to generally stronger prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products during due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil and north american natural gas prices  especially in light of a potentially weakening world economy in early  routine monitoring of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to increase over capital expenditures in are projected to total billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with continued development of producing and nonproducing deepwater fields as well as for the company s gulf of mexico exploration program 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of the kikeh field in block k  where continued drilling will lead to additional wells being brought on production during  and for development of natural gas fields in blocks sk and offshore sarawak where first production is anticipated in the bulk of canadian spending in will relate to natural gas development at the tupper field 
spending in the republic of congo includes continuing development costs for the azurite discovery offshore 
refining and marketing expenditures in should be about million of which about is allocated for the us  including funds for further purchases of land underlying stations at wal mart supercenters and construction of additional retail gasoline stations 
capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 

table of contents the company currently expects to fund its capital budget in using a combination of operating cash flow and available credit facilities 
the company forecasts an increase in long term debt of approximately million in this forecast could change based on actual cash flow generated from operations and actual levels of capital spending 
for example  a significant reduction in sales prices for crude oil and natural gas  without a corresponding decrease in capital spending  could cause the company s long term debt to rise by more than the current forecast 
oil prices weakened slightly in january compared to prices experienced near the end of  but in february oil prices rebounded to higher levels 
these oil prices remained above the prices used in the company s budget 
through early  margins of the company s refining and marketing operations were below amounts included in the company s budget 
the company currently expects production in to average about  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated start up of natural gas production from tupper in western canada and offshore malaysia 
oil production will continue to be ramped up at the kikeh field throughout in addition  continued reliability of facilities at significant non operated fields such as syncrude  hibernia and terra nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
murphy was a party to offsetting short term derivative instruments at december  for a notional amount of  barrels of oil that are intended to manage the purchase price of certain meraux refinery crude oil 
these contracts were marked to market at year end with a net charge of thousand 
a increase or decrease in the price of crude oil would have had no impact on pretax income
