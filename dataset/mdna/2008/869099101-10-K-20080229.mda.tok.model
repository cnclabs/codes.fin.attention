the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

table of contents critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing is discussed in detail in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including estimates of repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in estimates  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings provide additional information regarding recorded interests 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed within the body of this document

supplemental reporting of non gaap based financial measures return on average tangible equity is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable measure is return on average equity  which is calculated using gaap based amounts 
we calculate return on average tangible equity by excluding the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average equity 
management uses the return on average tangible equity in order to review our core operating results 
management believes that this is a better measure of our performance 
in addition  this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average equity to return on average tangible equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity efficiency ratio excluding hann is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable measure is efficiency ratio  which is calculated using gaap based amounts 
we measure our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income  on an fte basis  and noninterest income 
the presentation of an efficiency ratio excluding hann is computed as the efficiency ratio excluding the effect of hann 
management believes this to be a preferred measure because it excludes the volatility of vehicle residual values and vehicle delivery and preparation expense of hann and provides better visibility into our core business activities

table of contents net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  investment securities  and short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and the levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  the rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expense and yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities 
for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates 
table illustrates the changes in net interest income caused by changes in average volume  rates  and yields 
the million increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of increased volume in interest earning assets most notably in loans and leases  partially attributable to the community acquisition 
our net interest margin  however  declined basis points  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  this decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a basis point increase in rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities and an million decrease in average noninterest bearing demand deposits 
the basis point increase in rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities was partially offset by a basis point increase in yields on average interest earning assets

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans and leases  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan and lease growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans of million or greater are internally risk rated  using a standard rating system  by our loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan review personnel 
consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relatively small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
under our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses  loss rates for the last three years on a rolling quarter to quarter basis are determined for a commercial credits including agriculture  commercial  commercial real estate  land acquisition  development and construction and b consumer credits including residential real estate  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer revolving  and leases 
the loss rates are calculated for each affiliate bank  and they are applied to loan balances of the portfolio segments described above 

table of contents in addition to using loss rates  secured commercial non accrual loans of million or greater are reviewed for impairment as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas no 

those loans that have specific loss allocations are identified and included in the reserve allocation 
risk rated loans that are not reviewed for impairment are segregated into homogeneous pools with loss allocation rates that reflect the severity of risk 
loss rates are adjusted by applying other factors to the calculations 
these factors include adjustment for current economic trends  delinquency and risk trends  credit concentrations  credit administration  migration analysis  and other special allocations for unusual events or changes in products 
this methodology provides an in depth analysis of the portfolios of our banks and reflects the estimated losses within the various portfolios 
reserve allocations are then reviewed and consolidated 
this process is performed on a quarterly basis  including a risk rate review of commercial credit relationships at the banking affiliates 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given point in time is difficult  particularly during uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing process in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in conjunction with this continuing evaluation and with respect to the community acquisition  we recorded an million additional provision for loan and lease losses in the fourth quarter of this additional provision represented the estimated impact of applying our loan and lease loss reserve assessment process  which was discussed above  to community s loan portfolio 
furthermore  we evaluated community s loan portfolio at the time of acquisition and identified impaired loans  as defined in statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  totaling million and recorded a valuation allowance of million for those impaired loans 
the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was of period end loans and leases  or million  and of period end loans and leases  or million  at december  however  when the million valuation allowance discussed above is added to the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   the reserve ratio becomes 
in our opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to meet probable incurred loan and lease losses at december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not sustain losses in future periods that could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers may experience increasing difficulty in meeting their payment obligations  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is our policy not to renegotiate the terms of a commercial loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a commercial loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest income received on impaired commercial loans in and  was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no binding outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these impaired loans 

table of contents consumer loans are typically charged off when they are days past due unless they are secured by real estate 
loans secured by real estate are evaluated on the basis of collateral value 
loans that are well secured may continue to accrue interest  while other loans are charged down to net realizable value or placed on non accrual depending upon their loan to value ratio

table of contents table is a presentation of the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and not placed on non accrual 
at december   non performing assets totaled million and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure and million in restructured loans 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure and million in restructured loans 
the increase in non performing assets primarily is the result of million in nonaccrual loans and million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure that we acquired in the community transaction 
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans and leases coverage ratio decreased to at december   from at december  however  when the million valuation allowance discussed above is added to the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   the coverage ratio becomes

prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at december   an increase of million  from million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of the uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
these loans  which are not included in table  totaled million at december   and million at december  the increase 
table of contents of million can be attributed to million in potential problem loans acquired in the community transaction and migrations to our internally monitored loan list that occur in the normal course of business 
depending upon the state of the economy and its impact on these borrowers  as well as future events  such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future

salaries and employee benefits 
the largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which increased by in this increase is primarily the result of the inclusion of minotola operations for the entire twelve months of  as opposed to approximately eight months in  the inclusion of community operations since november   normal annual salary increases  and higher benefit costs 
occupancy and furniture and equipment 
the increase was attributable to the inclusion of minotola operations for the entire twelve months of  as opposed to approximately eight months in and the inclusion of community operations since november  amortization of intangible assets 
the increase was the result of the amortization of intangibles with finite lives that were recognized in the minotola  community and widmann siff acquisitions 
vehicle lease disposal 
the decrease primarily was the result of lower residual guarantee expense 
other expense 
the net decrease primarily was due to the elimination of monthly rental expense as a result of the termination of the sale leaseback transaction on january   which is described under the heading financial condition loans and leases 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in most other expense categories as a result of the inclusion of minotola operations for the entire twelve months of  as opposed to approximately eight months in  and the inclusion of community operations since november  income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively

table of contents investment securities securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost is recorded in the equity section  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income 
accordingly  as a result of changes in the interest rate environment and the portfolio restructurings discussed in the following paragraphs  our total equity was positively impacted by million 
unrealized losses  net of taxes  on available for sale securities totaled million at december   and unrealized gains  net of taxes  on available for sale securities totaled million at december  investment securities available for sale increased million  from december   to december  the fair value of securities acquired in the community transaction was million 
during may and june of  while planning for the community acquisition and the resulting growth and composition of the investment portfolio  our management performed a comprehensive review of our available for sale investments 
management determined that for administrative and operational purposes  small remaining portions in mortgage backed securities odd lots  or securities with remaining par amounts of less than million should be sold 
these odd lots  totaling million  resulted from previous mergers and bank consolidations and from principal amortization over time 
additionally  we determined that all collateralized mortgage obligations  regardless of the remaining par amount  with an aggregate total of million should be sold 
many of these mortgage obligations were acquired in the historic low interest rate environment of through this investment portfolio restructuring is expected to reduce administrative costs of managing odd lots  improve the yield on the investment portfolio  and enhance related net interest margin and net interest income 
the restructuring involved the sale of approximately of our available for sale investment portfolio  and resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million in june there was minimal impact on shareholders equity  as the decline in value of the investments had been reflected previously in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the proceeds from the sales of these securities were reinvested in a diversified mix of federal agency bullet debentures and commercial and residential mortgage backed securities with higher yields  longer duration  and positive convexity attributes 
the sold securities had a weighted average yield of  while the proceeds were reinvested in securities with an expected yield of 
in december  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of million  related to our corporate investment committee s decision to implement a modest restructuring program of our federal agency debenture portfolio in this restructuring program included the january sale of federal agency debentures classified as available for sale with an aggregate book value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  we do not believe that any remaining individual security with an unrealized loss  as of december   represents an other than temporary impairment 
unrealized losses recorded for us government agencies and mortgage backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates 
unrealized losses in other debt securities are attributable to market factors other than interest rates and credit risk 
we have both the intent and the ability to hold the securities for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement

loans and leases loans and leases increased billion  from december  to december  the fair value of loans and leases acquired in the community transaction was billion

average deposit balances by type and the associated average rate paid are summarized in table total deposits increased billion  or  from december   to december  the fair value of deposit liabilities assumed in the community acquisition totaled billion 
deposit growth of for  excluding the impact of the community acquisition  fell short of our expectations due to intense competition within our marketplace to attract new deposits 
we do not rely upon time deposits of million or more as a principal source of funds  as they represent only of total deposits

table of contents federal home loan bank borrowings and long term debt federal home loan bank borrowings increased million from december  to december  the fair value of fhlb borrowings assumed in the community transaction was million 
this increase is due to the fact that the increase in total deposits has been insufficient to support the growth in our loan and lease portfolio 
junior subordinated debentures increased million  from december   to december  the fair value of junior subordinated debentures assumed in the community transactions was million 
in addition  on december   we issued million of retail hybrid trust preferred notes through a newly formed delaware statutory trust  susquehanna capital i 
the only assets of the issuer are capital efficient notes issued by us 
the notes mature in december  are redeemable at our option beginning after five years  and bear interest initially at a rate of per annum through the interest payment date in december and  after the interest payment date in december  at a rate per annum equal to the three month libor plus 
the proceeds from the sale of the cents were used to replenish cash reserves used to pay for the cash portion of the community acquisition and for general corporate purposes

assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 

table of contents capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures reduced by excludable intangibles 
tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we  and each of our bank subsidiaries  have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
for additional information related to our risk based capital ratios  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
market risks the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
however  in addition to general banking risks  we have other risks that are related to vehicle leasing  asset securitizations  and off balance sheet financing that are also discussed below 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity risk the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiaries had approximately billion available to them under collateralized lines of credit with various fhlbs  and million more was available provided that additional collateral had been pledged 
liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity is also evaluated by taking into consideration maturing or readily marketable assets 
unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december   and represented additional sources of liquidity 
as an additional source of liquidity  we periodically enter into securitization transactions in which we sell the beneficial interests in loans and leases and related vehicles to qualified special purpose entities qspes 
the purchase of these assets by the qspes was financed through the issuance of asset backed notes to third party

interest rate risk the management of interest rate risk focuses on controlling the risk to net interest income and the associated net interest margin as the result of changing market rates and spreads 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the repricing and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our goal is to control risk exposure to changing rates within management s accepted guidelines to maintain an acceptable level of risk exposure in support of consistent earnings 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
these methods include basic gap analysis  which points to directional exposure  routine rate shocks simulation  and evaluation of the change in economic value of equity 
board directed guidelines have been adopted for both the rate shock simulations and economic value of equity exposure limits 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups fixed rate  floating rate  and those which reprice only at our discretion strategies are developed to control the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rate risk using the static gap analysis is presented in table this method reports the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a specific point in time 
management uses the static gap methodology to identify our directional interest rate risk 
table also illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated as of december   and these estimates include anticipated prepayments on commercial and residential loans  and mortgage backed securities  in addition to certain repricing assumptions relative to our core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
static gap analysis is widely accepted because of its simplicity in identifying interest rate risk exposure  but it ignores market spread adjustments  the changing mix of the balance sheet  planned balance sheet management strategies  and the change in prepayment assumptions

the financial simulation model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on embedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic values of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing embedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms in addition to general changes in customers needs 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
changes in market rates and general economic conditions will have an impact on an organization s mortgage backed security portfolio 
this will have an associated change on our sensitivity position in changing economic times 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice 
a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our floating rate loan portfolio is primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
the portfolio is funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings 
a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes to the different indices resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  such financial instruments 
basis risk is the result of this inconsistent change in the indices  with historical relationships not always being a good indicator

at december   the unrealized loss  net of taxes  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income was million 
our risk management objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest income and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our hedging strategy 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and a forecasted auto lease securitization 
the derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction

vehicle leasing residual value risk in an effort to manage the vehicle residual value risk arising from the auto leasing business of hann and our affiliate banks  hann and the banks have entered into arrangements with auto lenders liquidation center  inc auto lenders pursuant to which hann or a bank  as applicable  effectively transferred to auto lenders all residual value risk of its respective auto lease portfolio  and all residual value risk on any new leases originated over the term of the applicable agreement 
auto lenders  which was formed in  is a used vehicle remarketer with four retail locations in new jersey and has access to various wholesale facilities throughout the country 
under these arrangements  auto lenders agrees to purchase the beneficial interest in all vehicles returned by the obligors at the scheduled expiration of the related leases for a purchase price equal to the stated residual value of such vehicles 
stated residual values of new leases are set in accordance with the standards approved in advance by auto lenders 
under a servicing agreement with auto lenders  hann also agrees to make monthly guaranty payments to auto lenders based upon a negotiated schedule covering a three year period 
at the end of each year  the servicing agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties 
table of contents for an additional one year term  beyond the current three year term  subject to renegotiation of the payments for the additional year 
during the renewal process  we periodically obtain competitive quotes from third parties to determine the best remarketing and or residual guarantee alternatives for hann and our bank affiliates

 and a net gain or loss is recognized at the time of the initial sale 
the qspes then issue beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated asset backed securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the qspes 
the senior classes of the asset basked securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the time of issuance 
these ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower rated subordinated classes of asset backed securities  as well as subordinated interests retained by susquehanna 
excess cash flows represent the cash flows from the underlying assets less distributions of cash flows to beneficial interest holders in accordance with the distribution priority requirements of the transaction 
we  as servicer  distribute to third party beneficial interest holders contracted returns 
we retain the right to remaining cash flows after distributions to these third party beneficial interest holders 
the cash flows are discounted to present value and recorded as interest only strips 
the resulting interest only strips are subordinate to the rights of each of the third party beneficial interest holders 
we estimate the fair value of these interest only strips based on the present value of future expected cash flows  using management s estimate of the key assumptions regarding credit losses  prepayment speeds  and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved at the time assets are sold to the applicable qspe and adjusted quarterly based on changes in these key economic risk factors 
based upon the information found in the table in footnote  securitization activity  we believe that any adverse change of in the key economic assumptions would not have a significant effect on the fair value of our interest only strips 
in order to facilitate lease securitizations and other off balance sheet financings  hann formed hann auto trust  a delaware statutory trust the origination trust  on september   pursuant to a trust agreement between hann  as settlor and initial beneficiary  and a third party trustee 
the primary business purpose of the origination trust is to enter into lease contracts with respect to automobiles  sport utility vehicles  light duty trucks  and other vehicles and to serve as record holder of title to such leased vehicles 
unlike ordinary accounts 
table of contents receivable or lease paper  a motor vehicle can only be transferred if the transferor signs the back of the certificate of title and certifies the odometer reading  and the transferee applies for a new certificate of title in its own name 
with the use of an origination or titling trust like the origination trust  a party may hold a beneficial interest in a lease and the related vehicle including the related cash flows  but because legal ownership of the vehicle remains with the trust  the vehicle need not be retitled 
the origination trust was created to avoid the administrative difficulty and expense associated with retitling leased vehicles in a securitization  sale leaseback  or other financing of automobile and truck leases and the related vehicles 
upon formation  the origination trust issued to hann the undivided trust interest representing the entire beneficial interest in the unallocated assets of the origination trust 
hann purchases vehicles and related leases directly from motor vehicle dealers 
the motor vehicle dealers title these vehicles in the name of the origination trust at the time of the purchase 
hann initially owns the beneficial interest in all leases and related vehicles 
under the trust agreement for the origination trust  hann may instruct the trustees of the trust to establish a special unit of beneficial interest in the origination trust commonly referred to as a subi and to allocate a separate portfolio of leases and the related vehicles leased under the leases to that subi 
the subi will evidence an indirect beneficial interest  rather than a direct legal interest  in the assets allocated thereto 
under the terms of the trust agreement and the delaware statutory trust act  the holder of a subi will have no interest in the assets allocated to the undivided trust interest or to any other subi  and the holder of the undivided trust interest will have no interest in the assets allocated to any subi 
hann creates and transfers beneficial interests in the origination trust that represent the rights in pools of leases and related vehicles included in securitization  sale leaseback  agency  and other transactions 
the beneficial interests in the origination trust represented by a subi have only been used for securitizations  sale leasebacks  agency transactions  and as a method of permitting affiliates of hann to hold the beneficial interest in a pool of leases and related vehicles 
there are no other transactions using a subi in the origination trust 
the leases  for accounting purposes  are treated as direct financing receivables as a result of a residual purchase agreement with auto lenders 
although we have not retained residual value risk in the automobile leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders  a qspe may suffer residual losses  which we expect would decrease the value of the interest only strips recognized by us

summary of securitization transactions in prior reporting periods home equity loans in september  one of our banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank pa  entered into a term securitization transaction of fixed rate home mortgage loans and adjustable rate helocs the september transaction 
some of the loans sold were originated by two of our other banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank and susquehanna bank dv  and sold to susquehanna bank pa immediately prior to the closing of the securitization 
in connection with the september transaction  susquehanna bank pa sold a portfolio of fixed rate home equity loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million and a portfolio of adjustable rate helocs with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the transferor 
in the transaction documents for the september transaction  susquehanna bank pa provides  among other things  representations and warranties with respect to the home equity loans transferred 
in the event that any such representations and warranties were materially untrue with respect to any assets when transferred  the affected loans must be repurchased by susquehanna bank pa 
we provide a guaranty of such repurchase obligation 
the transferor sold the portfolio acquired from susquehanna bank pa to a newly formed statutory trust the issuer 
the equity interests of the issuer other than a non economic interest representing tax ownership of the securitized fixed rate home equity loan portfolio are owned by the transferor 
the transferor financed the purchase of the portfolio of home equity loans from susquehanna bank pa primarily through the issuance by the issuer of million of floating rate asset backed notes to third party investors 
in connection with the securitization  susquehanna retained servicing responsibilities for the loans 
a portion of the helocs  which generally accrue interest at a variable rate  include a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
the maximum dollar amount of the portfolio balances sold in the september transaction that is subject to this conversion feature was million at the transaction cut off date 
during the draw period  the obligor may request that susquehanna establish fixed rate repayment terms for an amount not to exceed the then outstanding balance under the credit line 
requests must be for amounts which do not exceed the credit limit  and no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the request 
we complete all required underwriting at the time of origination  and no additional underwriting occurs at the time the obligor exercises the fixed rate conversion feature 
the credit limit will include credit advances under the credit line and outstanding balances under the previously requested fixed rate repayments 
the minimum fixed rate repayment request is three thousand dollars 
the obligor may elect to submit fixed rate repayment requests at any time during the draw period 
the obligor is limited to three fixed rate repayment schedules at any time 
the reason for permitting the conversion feature is to be competitive in our marketplace  as many other financial institutions offer this feature 
in the september transaction  one class of the issuer s floating rate asset backed notes was backed by variable rate helocs 
however  approximately of the helocs as of the cut off date for the transaction included a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the outstanding balance from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
if a significant portion of obligors elected to fix the rate of interest on their mortgage loans  then the issuer might have insufficient funds to make payments on the floating rate notes backed by the helocs as rates increase beyond the rate of the fixed rate loans 
to mitigate the effect of this remote risk  the external parties involved in structuring the september transaction and susquehanna worked together to formulate a solution acceptable to the parties 
the parties determined that the issuer s ability to make interest payments on the class of floating rate notes backed by the helocs was unlikely to be materially and adversely affected if the issuer s portfolio of helocs included up to fixed rate loans 
after that threshold was exceeded  however  susquehanna bank pa would be required to repurchase loans with converted balances 
table of contents in an amount not to exceed of the original principal balance of the helocs  which is approximately million 
under the transaction agreements  susquehanna bank pa is neither required nor permitted to repurchase more than of the original principal balance of the converted loans 
however  because up to of the helocs could be held by the issuer as fixed rate loans in excess of the threshold acceptable to the parties  the issuer entered into an interest rate protection agreement with susquehanna  structured in accordance with fas no 
 paragraph  to protect the third party beneficial interest holders above the threshold 
the interest rate protection agreement counterparty is susquehanna  and the agreement provides the issuer with an additional source of funds to make payments on the floating rate notes if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rates of the loans for which the related obligors have exercised their fixed rate conversion feature 
based on our historical experience with helocs with the conversion feature  we determined that it was highly unlikely that more than of the helocs held by the issuer would be converted by the related obligors from variable rate to fixed rate obligations 
this conclusion is based in part on our experience with helocs that have conversion features  which tend to be converted by obligors from variable rate to fixed rate within the first three to six months after origination 
the securitized pool  at the time the loans were transferred to the issuer  was generally seasoned more than six months 
further  we determined that it is highly unlikely that we will have any liability under the interest rate protection agreement provided for in the transaction agreements because we believe that  based upon historical experience and business understanding of obligor behavior  less than of the helocs will be converted by the related obligors to fixed rate loans 
the estimated maximum cost and fair value to susquehanna of complying with the interest rate protection discussed above is considered de minimis

under the transaction documents for the heloc transaction  if the aggregate principal balance of loans converted to fixed rate loans exceeds of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then susquehanna bank pa is required to repurchase converted loans in excess of this threshold until the aggregate principal balance of loans repurchased by susquehanna bank pa for this reason is equal to of the original principal balance of the loans 
if  after giving effect to any repurchase by susquehanna bank pa of loans with converted balances  the aggregate principal balance of fixed interest rate loans exceeds of the aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then an interest rate protection agreement between the issuer and susquehanna becomes operative 
under the interest rate protection agreement  the issuer will be obligated to make fixed payments  which will be based on the fixed rates of the converted mortgage loans  and we will be obligated to make floating payments  which will be based on the indices of the variable rate mortgage loans 
we do not expect to repurchase any converted loans nor enter into any interest rate protection agreements 
in this transaction  the issuer issued floating rate asset backed notes to third party investors  which were backed by variable rate helocs 
however  approximately of the loans as of the cut off date for the transaction included a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the outstanding balance from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
if a significant portion of obligors elected to fix the rate of interest on their mortgage loans  then the issuer might have insufficient funds to make payments on the floating rate notes as rates increase beyond the rate of the fixed rate loans 
to mitigate the effect of this remote risk  the external parties involved in structuring the heloc transaction and susquehanna worked together to formulate a solution acceptable to the parties 
the parties determined that the issuer s ability to make interest payments on the floating rate notes was unlikely to be materially and adversely affected if the issuer s assets included up to fixed rate loans 
after that threshold was exceeded  however  susquehanna bank pa would be required to repurchase loans with converted balances in an amount not to exceed of the original principal balance of the helocs  which is approximately million 
under the transaction agreements  susquehanna bank pa is neither required nor permitted to repurchase more than of the original principal balance of the converted loans 
however  because up to of loans could be held by the issuer as fixed rate loans in excess of the threshold acceptable to the parties  the issuer entered into an interest rate protection agreement with us  structured in accordance with fas no 
 paragraph  to protect the third party beneficial interest holders  above the threshold 
the interest rate protection agreement counterparty is susquehanna  and the agreement provides the issuer with an additional source of funds to make payments on the floating rate notes if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rates of the loans for which the related obligors have exercised their fixed rate conversion feature 
our estimated maximum cost of complying with the interest rate protection is considered de minimis 
based on our historical experience with helocs with the conversion feature  we determined that it was highly unlikely that more than of the helocs held by the issuer would be converted by the related obligors from variable rate to fixed rate obligations 
this conclusion is based in part on our experience with helocs that have conversion features  which tend to be converted by obligors from variable rate to fixed rate within the first three to six months after origination 
the securitized pool  at the time the loans were transferred to the issuer  was generally seasoned more than six months

from time to time  the qspe may purchase the beneficial 
table of contents interests in additional automobile leases and related vehicles from hann 
transfers to the qspe are accounted for as sales under the guidelines of fas no 
the qspe finances the purchases by borrowing funds in an amount up to million from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer the lender 
there were no transfers made to the qspe during neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for credit losses 
however  the qspe s obligation to pay hann the servicing fee each month is subordinate to the qspe s obligation to pay interest  principal and fees due on the loans 
therefore  if the qspe suffers credit losses on its assets  it may have insufficient funds to pay the servicing fee to hann 
additionally  if an early amortization event were to occur under the qspe s loan agreement  hann  as servicer  would not receive payments of the servicing fee until all interest  principal and fees due on the loans have been paid although the servicing fee will continue to accrue 
pursuant to the loan agreement for the transaction  an early amortization event would occur if  among other things  the portfolio failed to meet certain performance tests  or if the qspe were to breach a material representation  warranty or covenant  or were to become insolvent 
in connection with the transaction  susquehanna has entered into a back up servicing agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to service the automobile leases and related vehicles beneficially owned by the qspe if hann is terminated as servicer 
if susquehanna were appointed servicer  it would receive a servicing fee each month 
the debt issued in the revolving securitization transaction will bear a floating rate of interest and the securitized portfolio accrues interest at a fixed rate 
under the transaction  on each monthly payment date  if the weighted average fixed interest rate of the securitized portfolio is less than the minimum required portfolio yield  and the amount on deposit in the yield supplement account is less than the targeted portfolio yield  then payments will begin under the interest rate hedge agreement established with the administrator pursuant to the loan documents 
the interest rate hedge protects the third party beneficial interest holders from interest rate fluctuations and is structured in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
the aggregate notional amount of the qspe s interest rate hedge as of any date will be calculated to equal the expected amortization of the outstanding loan amount on such date 
the targeted portfolio yield is calculated on each monthly payment date using a formula specified in the loan documents that takes into account the aggregate outstanding lease balance of the portfolio  the weighted average remaining life of the portfolio  the weighted average fixed interest rate of the portfolio assets and the minimum required portfolio yield 
the minimum required portfolio yield is calculated on each monthly payment date using a formula specified in the loan documents that takes into account the cost of funds  the average swap rate  and servicing and administration fees paid by the qspe  together with the level of excess spread required by the lender 
the yield supplement account exists as a reserve account to provide the qspe with an additional source of funds in circumstances where the yield on the portfolio assets is less than the minimum required portfolio yield 
events of default include  among other things  failure of the hedge to be maintained 
upon such an occurrence  the lender could accelerate the principal of the loans  and the collateral agent  on behalf of the lender and other secured parties  could exercise standard remedies of a secured creditor  such as seizing and selling the collateral 
we do not foresee any reasonable circumstance where the qspe would not be able to maintain the interest rate hedge and thereby trigger an event of default under the loan documents 
the transaction documents for the revolving transaction contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences  including early amortization events  which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold portfolio to meet certain performance tests measured on a monthly basis relating to losses  delinquencies  vehicle turn in rates  and residual values 
the transaction documents also provide that any assets that failed to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in such transaction documents at the time such assets were transferred to the qspe must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust

agency agreements and lease sales agency arrangements and lease sales generally occur on economic terms similar to vehicle lease terms and generally result in no accounting gains or losses to hann and no retention of credit  residual value  or interest rate risk with respect to the sold assets 
agency arrangements involve the origination and servicing by hann of automobile leases for other financial institutions  and lease sales involve the sale of previously originated leases with servicing retained to other financial institutions 
hann generally is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors  a servicing fee  and in the case of agency arrangements  an origination fee per lease 
lease sales are generally accounted for as sales under fas no 
during the second quarter of  hann entered into an agency arrangement 
in connection with that arrangement  we entered into an agreement under which we guarantee auto lenders performance of its obligations to the agency client the residual interest agreement 
auto lenders has agreed to purchase leased vehicles in the agency client s portfolio at the termination of the leases for the full residual value of those vehicles 
in the event the agency client incurs any losses  costs or expenses as a result of any failure of auto lenders to perform this purchase obligation  we will compensate the agency client for any final liquidation losses with respect to such leased vehicle 
our liability  however  is limited to of the maximum aggregate residual value of all leases purchased by the agency client 
at december   the total residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio for this transaction was million  and our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december   was immaterial 
sale leaseback transaction in december  hann sold and contributed the beneficial interest in million of automobiles and related auto leases owned by the origination trust to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the lessee 
the lessee sold such beneficial interests to a lessor the lessor  and the lessor in turn leased the beneficial interests in the automobiles and auto leases back to the lessee under a master lease agreement that had an eight year term 
for accounting purposes  the sale leaseback transaction between the lessee and the lessor was treated as a sale and an operating lease and qualified as a sale and leaseback under fas no 
during the third quarter of  we notified the lessor of our intention to exercise the early buyout option  and the transaction was terminated january  the early buyout option price was million and was comprised of million of beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles and payment of million in cash  which had been recognized in other operating expense in prior years 
a significant portion of the automobile leases and related vehicles that hann acquired in conjunction with the early buyout option was sold to our banking subsidiaries and included in the vehicle lease securitization transaction that closed february  
table of contents servicing fees under the securitization transactions  agency agreements  and lease sales servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets 
the servicing fees paid to hann under the lease securitization transactions  agency agreements  and lease sales approximate current market value 
hann has not recorded servicing assets or liabilities with regard to those transactions because its expected servicing costs are approximately equal to its expected servicing income 
the parent company acts as servicer for securitized home equity loans and recorded aggregate servicing assets based on the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
the unamortized balance of these assets was million at december  in addition  as part of the community transaction  we acquired mortgage servicing rights with an unamortized balance of million relating to the servicing of mortgages sold to fnma and fhlmc 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
overall however  we enter into securitization transactions primarily to achieve low cost funding for the growth of our loan and lease portfolio and to manage capital  and not primarily to maximize our ongoing servicing fee revenue 
in the future  in regard to lease securitizations  if servicing costs were to exceed servicing income  we would record the present value of that liability as an expense 
our policy regarding the impairment of servicing assets is to evaluate the assets based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
fair value is based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount

in september  the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focused primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use could lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focused primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
in the past  susquehanna used the iron curtain method 
in sab  the sec staff established a model  commonly referred to as a dual approach  that required quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab permitted public companies to initially apply its provisions either by restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january   with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
as susquehanna has always used the iron curtain method  applying the provisions of sab did not result in either restating prior financial statements or recording a cumulative adjustment
