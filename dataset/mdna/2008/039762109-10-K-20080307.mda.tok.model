item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other parts of this report and other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales  operating results and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently known to the company 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company changes in economic  political or social conditions our profitability may be impacted by overall economic conditions  particularly in southern california 
changes in economic conditions such as inflation  employment levels  interest rates and tax rates may reduce consumer spending or influence our customers to shift their spending to our competitors 
in addition  our business may be subject to interruption from acts of terrorism  national emergencies or natural disasters 
competition in the grocery business the retail grocery business is intensely competitive with respect to price  food quality and selection  service and location 
during the past several years  there has been a consolidation in the supermarket industry 
we are in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
there are a number of well established competitors with substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than ours  some of which are also nonunion 
we frequently face the opening of a new or remodeled competitor s store in our trade area 
competition also requires us to periodically remodel our existing stores  at ever increasing costs  in order to maintain their appeal 
an inability to successfully compete with other grocery retailers in our trade areas could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability 
new labor contracts and labor stoppages the majority of our employees belong to unions with which we have signed labor agreements which establish rates of pay  benefits and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in order to continue to attract and retain quality personnel  we may accept terms that increase our operating costs  which in turn  may negatively impact our profitability 
if contract negotiations are not successful  the union could recommend that our employees vote to strike our stores  distribution center and offices 
in february  the company completed negotiations with the ufcw to renew the contract covering the majority of our employees which expired on march  the new contract discontinues the use of a two tier wage structure and provides for  among other things  wage increases and modifications to the pension and health and welfare plans 
our new contract expires march  in july  the ufcw completed negotiation of a new contract with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area 
the wage increases agreed to by these three competitors were somewhat less than the company agreed to for certain job classifications and experience levels 
this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose labor costs are less than our own 
the new agreement between the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers expires on march   one year after gelson s contract with the ufcw expires 
retention of key personnel our success is dependent on our key employees 
we must continue to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel including the replacement of senior management upon retirement 
individuals of this caliber are historically in short supply and this shortage may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and thus  may hinder our ability to operate effectively 
changes in laws or regulations or failure to comply we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and licensing requirements which regulate health and sanitation standards  food labeling and handling  the sale of alcoholic beverages  employment  working conditions  citizenship requirements and public accommodations 
changes to such laws or regulations may adversely affect our profitability by increasing our costs or affecting the sale of certain items 
in addition  we must comply with state and local fire  zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect the operation of our existing stores or could delay or prevent the opening of a new store 
changes in accounting standards  policies and practices the issuance of new pronouncements or changes to existing accounting policies and practices could have a significant impact on our reported results or change the way we account for various transactions 
new policies and changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
availability and retention of retail space we currently lease the majority of our store locations 
typically  our supermarket leases have initial year lease terms and may include options for up to an additional years 
the average term remaining on our supermarket leases  including renewal options  is approximately years 
our revenues and profitability would be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew these leases at reasonable rates 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new trade areas and to operate these stores successfully 
our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations  and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites 
we may not be able to find suitable locations that meet our demographic requirements at a reasonable cost 
the ability of our vendors to supply products and services in a timely manner our business is dependent on our ability to purchase products from a large wholesaler and numerous smaller vendors in a timely manner and at competitive prices 
the largest supplier for our stores is unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has provided product for our stores for approximately thirty three years 
we currently procure approximately of our product from unified 
any disruption in the business of unified or any of our other principal suppliers could negatively impact our sales and profitability 
even where we have access to alternative sources of supply  the failure of a supplier to meet our demands may temporarily disrupt store level merchandise selection 
ability to control insurance coverage costs and claims experience we use a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for coverage associated with losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  fiduciary  employment practices liability  business interruption  crime  earthquake and health care 
if insurance costs increase  it could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications  cost control measures  sales increases or by improving our operating efficiency 
we are self insured for general and auto liability and  in some prior years  for workers compensation as well 
we have stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure on a per claim basis and are insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
the company devotes substantial time and effort to maintaining a safe environment in our stores  warehouse and offices 
however  the cost of both insured and self insured plans is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of premiums and our ability to manage claims 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings from time to time we are the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging injury  food quality or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former or current employees  claims concerning hazardous substances on our current or previously owned properties  class action suits concerning warning labels and other claims 
a lawsuit or claim could result in a decision against us that could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  the cost of defending ourselves against lawsuits and claims  regardless of merit  could have a negative impact on our profitability 
impact of local projects in the vicinity of our supermarkets from time to time  local events or projects take place in the vicinity of our stores that may have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 
stock price volatility the market price of our class a common stock class a could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events including general economic and market conditions  variations in our earnings results  publicity regarding us and our competitors and the grocery business in general 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
furthermore  there is not a significant volume of trading in our class a which subjects our stock price to a higher level of volatility and may adversely impact the liquidity of the stock 
in march  the company merged its stock bonus plan into its k retirement savings plan k plan in order to satisfy the new congressionally mandated diversification requirements 
stock previously held for the benefit of participants in the company s stock bonus plan was transferred to individual participant accounts in the company s k plan 
as of december   participants in the company s k plan held  shares of class a in the k plan 
these participants can elect to sell their shares which may have a negative effect on the price of class a 
fluctuations in our class a price also impact compensation expense as it relates to our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars

overview arden is a holding company which conducts operations through its first and second tier wholly owned subsidiaries  arden mayfair and gelson s  respectively 
gelson s operates full service supermarkets in southern california 
gelson s caters to the upscale customer who expects superior quality  service and merchandise selection 
in addition to the customary supermarket offerings  gelson s offers specialty items such as imported foods  unusual delicatessen items and organic and natural food products 
all gelson s stores include the typical service departments such as meat  seafood  delicatessen  floral  sushi  cheese and bakery 
in addition  some stores offer further services including fresh pizza  coffee bars  gelato bars and carving carts offering cooked meats 
the company s management focuses on a number of performance indicators in evaluating financial condition and results of operations 
same store sales  gross profit and labor costs are some of the key factors that management considers 
both sales and gross profit are significantly influenced by competition in our trade area 
gelson s already faces competition from regional and national supermarket chains most of which have greater resources and a larger market share than gelson s  stores specializing in natural and organic foods  specialty and gourmet markets and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
we anticipate having increased competition from new competitors moving into our trade area 
in addition  if the merger trend among our competitors continues  this may impact our ability to compete  as the newly formed larger competitors may possess stronger bargaining power with vendors and suppliers and have greater market recognition among consumers 
labor and other related payroll costs are the second largest expense after product cost incurred by gelson s  and thus is a financial measure which is carefully monitored by management 
as of fiscal year end  gelson s had approximately  full time and  part time store  warehouse and office employees 
the majority of gelson s employees are members of the ufcw 
in february  the company completed negotiation of a new union contract with the ufcw to replace the contract which expired on march  the three major grocery retailers in our trade area had not reached an agreement by this date 
the new gelson s contract starts the elimination process of the two tier wage configuration and returns it to a single wage structure and provides for  among other things  wage increases and modifications to the company s pension and health and welfare contribution rates 
the company s employees who are members of the ufcw voted to ratify the new contract in a vote held on february and  the new contract expires march  the company contributes to a multi employer health care and pension plan trust on behalf of its employees who are members of the ufcw 
all employers who participate in a multi employer plan are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plan 
consequently  the benefit contribution rates that the company negotiated with the ufcw effective march were subject to change retroactively based on the outcome of the union s negotiations with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area which were completed in july the employees of the three major grocery retailers voted to ratify their contract on july  the new agreement expires march   one year after gelson s contract with the ufcw expires 
if no extension agreement is reached and gelson s contract expires prior to the others  it is possible that gelson s will be required to negotiate separately and suffer a job action if an agreement cannot be reached 
the agreement reached with the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers resulted in a substantial reduction in the average hourly contribution rates for pension and health care 
the majority of the reduction relates to the health and welfare fund which  as of the first quarter of  was overfunded in total  for all employers  by approximately  the reduction in the health and welfare contribution rate is expected to substantially reduce the overfunded status of the fund during the term of the new contract between the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers 
the change in contribution rates for both pension and health care were retroactive to the beginning of march the reduction in the contribution rates has and will continue to result in a substantial decrease in the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expense when comparing periods covered by the current and the expired contracts 
the agreement that the majors reached with the ufcw also provides for hourly wage rates based on job classification and experience that  in some cases  are less than those agreed to by gelson s 
this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose hourly rates are less than our own 
increases in wages provided under the new contract will increase the company s payroll costs unless it is able to offset the increased expense through a combination of sales growth  increased gross margin  management of labor hours  decreased labor turnover and cost savings in other areas 
another component of labor related expense is the cost of workers compensation 
for claims incurred prior to july   the company is primarily self insured through the use of a high deductible policy which provides the company with stop loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis and provides coverage for qualifying costs in excess of per claim limits 
effective july  the company purchased a one year fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy to replace the high deductible program for losses occurring after june  the guaranteed cost program eliminates the company s risk against claims occurring after june  and has resulted in a decrease in workers compensation expense 
effective july  the company entered into another one year fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy at a significantly lower rate compared to the previous policy year which will further reduce sg a expense through june  the company continues to maintain an accrual for claims incurred prior to july under the high deductible program 
that accrual is based on both undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment  the ultimate cost of workers compensation is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of health care costs and the company s ability to manage claims 
in the past  the company s quarterly results have reflected significant fluctuations in operating income as a result of adjustments recorded to reflect the change in the fair value of sars that have been granted to non employee directors and certain employees 
each sar entitles the holder to receive cash upon exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the company s class a  as determined in accordance with the sars agreement  on the date of exercise over the fair market value of such share on the date granted 
fluctuations in the market price of the company s class a from the end of the previous fiscal year impact the recognition or reversal of sars compensation expense in the year being reported upon 
since the company cannot predict future fluctuations in the market price of its stock  it also cannot forecast future sars compensation expense adjustments and the extent to which operating income will be impacted 
results of operations compared to net income in increased to  compared to  during operating income increased to  in compared to  in sales from the company s supermarkets all of which are located in southern california  including revenue from licensing arrangements  subleases  leases and finance charges  were  in this represents an increase of 
from  when sales were  the company has experienced sales growth due to product pricing decisions primarily due to product cost increases partially offset by a decrease in customer count 
sales during were influenced by increased competition in our trade area from new competitors entering our market 
in addition  the merger trend amongst our competitors resulted in larger companies that possess stronger market recognition 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in in calculating gross profit  the company deducts product costs  net of discounts and allowances  and inbound freight charges  as well as warehouse  transportation  purchasing  advertising and occupancy costs in cost of sales 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the company may not be comparable to those of other companies in the grocery industry since there may be differences in recording certain costs as cost of sales or as sg a expense 
sg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in the company s provision for all union pension and health care plans decreased to  in compared to  in due to a reduction in the average hourly contribution rates for pension and health care as discussed above as well as a slight decrease in the number of hours eligible for contributions

the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims as well as for workers compensation in some prior years 
the company has stop loss insurance coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis and is insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion  recorded reserves for general and auto liability claims and workers compensation are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
in addition to high deductible coverage for workers compensation and general and auto liability claims  the company also carries property  business interruption  fiduciary  directors and officers  crime  earthquake  special event and employment practices liability insurance 
management believes  based on recent and past experience  that current insurance coverage meets the reasonable requirements of the company

the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories supermarket nonperishable inventories are recorded using the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo basis or market 
inventory reserves are maintained for dry goods at historical run rates that are adjusted annually  and trued up at each physical count three times per year to ensure adequacy of the reserve 
inventories of perishable items are taken at the end of every month  and balances are adjusted accordingly with the offset recorded in cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows undiscounted and before interest charges are less than carrying value 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets could occur 
to the extent that an asset is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against earnings 
workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims and for all open years prior to july  for workers compensation 
the company purchases stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred are dependent on future developments  in management s opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
the company purchased a fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy for losses occurring after june  this policy replaced the high deductible program for workers compensation 
cost of sales cost of sales reflects the direct costs involved in bringing the company s product to market including product costs  net of discounts and allowances  and inbound freight charges  as well as warehouse  transportation  purchasing  advertising and occupancy costs

vendor allowances promotional and rebate allowances make up the majority of all allowances received by gelson s from its vendors 
with promotional allowances  vendors pay the company to promote their product 
the promotion may be a temporary price reduction  a feature in a print advertisement or newsletter  or placement of the vendor s product in a preferred location in a store 
the promotions are typically two to three weeks long and are recognized when the commitment has been fulfilled 
promotional and vendor cash rebate allowances are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
the company also receives other allowances which are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when they are earned 
occasionally  the company receives rebate allowances in the form of upfront lump sum payments from vendors 
under the terms of these long term agreements which typically extend for several months or years  the company earns the rebates as it purchases product from the vendor 
the upfront payments are recorded as a liability when they are received and are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost as the product is purchased 
in the event that the company does not purchase the minimum amount of product specified in the agreement  the upfront payments must be returned on a pro rata basis to the vendor 
if the contract does not specify that the rebate is earned as product is purchased  then the upfront payments are recorded as a liability when received and recognized as a reduction of cost of sales on a pro rata basis as the product is sold
