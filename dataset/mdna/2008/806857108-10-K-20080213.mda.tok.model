table of contents part ii  item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements relating to our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and resources 
such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under item a 
risk factors of this report 
executive overview oil markets exhibited considerable variation in the opec production cuts of november that provoked the recovery in the price per barrel entering the winter period in the northern hemisphere were overweighed by mild early winter weather conditions that lead to wti west texas intermediate falling to the year low of per barrel by mid january 
however  price for wti ending the year within striking distance of per barrel 
market fundamentals supported this upwards trend as evidenced by the need for an opec production increase in september and by the reduction in the days of forward cover of oecd organization for economic co operation and development oil stocks which had fallen below days by the end of year 
spare production margins remained narrow  driven by geopolitical events and inherent production decline  while non opec production levels continued to be revised downwards as project delays added further uncertainty to performance 
in natural gas markets  the weak prices seen at the beginning of strengthened significantly as colder weather drove demand in north america 
the region s gas supply results from four separate components that include domestic production  lng liquefied natural gas imports  canadian exports to the us  and us exports to mexico 
changes in any of these affect overall supply and during the year higher production and higher imports  particularly of lng  led to above average levels of natural gas storage in the us with consequent weaker commodity pricing later in the year 
maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas continues to face challenges 
in both cases  the aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades gives rise to increasing production decline rates that require constant stemming  while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits in increasingly more remote areas and complex geologies must increase 
within this context  schlumberger revenue in grew by  driven by strong demand for oilfield services  particularly overseas 
year on year growth rates reached in middle east asia  in europe cis africa and in latin america 
in north america however  revenue was essentially flat relative to all oilfield services technologies showed double digit improvement  with drilling measurements  well testing and integrated project management recording the highest overall growth rates year on year 
the business pattern that emerged in with significant differences in growth inside and outside north america marked a change in the oil and gas industry growth cycle 
there were two reasons for this 
north american activity is largely driven by natural gas exploration and production and the number of active drilling rigs proved sufficient to maintain satisfactory levels of production at least in the short term 
in addition  the strong international growth was mainly directed to oil and primarily land based as the available offshore rig fleet reached full utilization particularly in deep water 
new schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in in line with the need for improved well performance for example  particularly through stimulation of natural gas wells  schlumberger introduced the contact family of staged fracturing and completion services early in the year 
these services penetrated a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation technologies 
in north america  contact services demonstrated their ability to place fracture treatments more accurately while stimulating multiple productive sands in a single operation to increase production and lower cost 
contact technologies were also demonstrated and deployed in gabon  kuwait and saudi arabia  with significant production improvements in every case 

table of contents part ii  item within this landscape  schlumberger made further progress in areas where competitive advantage exists in technology and business model 
in russia  schlumberger further expanded operations through the acquisition of tyumenpromgeofizika  a west siberian wireline logging company 
elsewhere in siberia  manufacturing activities increased as wireline and well services began assembly of perforating and pumping equipment in tyumen 
research and engineering activity accelerated with the opening of the new moscow research center and the extension of the engineering center in novosibirsk 
and to address the needs of the increased staff in russia  the siberian training center partially opened for a number of training courses at the end of the year with full operation expected early in russia also benefited from expanding take up of integrated project management services in siberia 
similar operations began in other geomarket regions in europe cis africa  and there was further strong growth in the well construction businesses in latin america  where a new phase of deeper  hotter and more complex operations started in mexico 
these events are consistent with our goal of growing project management services at a much higher rate than the rest of the business 
growth at westerngeco  where full year revenue increased by over  matched the overall trend set by oilfield services 
this was driven by demand for marine seismic and multiclient data sales while q technology revenue increased again to a new high of billion  up versus vessel utilization for the year reached  with half of the marine fleet now equipped with q technology systems 
the strength of the seismic market  particularly in marine services  led us to review our long term plans for the fleet  resulting in the acquisition of eastern echo in november 
the six new high performance  high capacity vessels on order are ideally suited to the exploration and development markets of the future  and all six will be fitted with q technology equipment 
in addition to the acquisitions of tyumenpromgeofizika and eastern echo  technology based growth was furthered through a number of smaller acquisitions made during the year 
these included insensys oil gas fiber optic technology for the expanding subsea market  vips reservoir software and interpretation expertise to accelerate schlumberger strength in geomechanics  innerlogix information management technology for data quality improvement and geosystem electromagnetic technology to expand westerngeco electromagnetics solutions 
the technology portfolio was also boosted by the acquisition of a further share in framo engineering as to take the schlumberger holding to a majority 
framo is a norwegian based company providing multiphase booster pumps  flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems 
we will begin consolidating the results of framo in the first quarter of in early  we reiterated our view that while schlumberger would continue to see high growth through the end of the present decade  growth rates would ultimately slow from the breakneck pace of the earlier part of strong growth was indeed seen in  but the shorter term outlook for has become more complex  with several factors set to influence the business in the coming year 
on the positive side  growth in land activity outside north america will remain strong  and seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand on land and offshore as the industry gears up for an expanded exploration phase 
however  in north america we do not expect levels of natural gas drilling to vary greatly in the absence of severe winter weather 
overall growth will also be restricted by the high utilization of the existing offshore rig fleet and the fact that only limited new builds will enter the market over the next months 
this will make activity vulnerable to operating efficiency 
maintaining and increasing the production base for both oil and natural gas will continue to be challenging 
the aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades requires high levels of activity in order to stem decline  while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits in ever more remote areas and complex geologies must increase 
in the longer term  current levels of drilling are insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates  improve reservoir recovery or add sufficient new production capacity 
the explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years  the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery 
table of contents part ii  item through and beyond the end of the decade  and the industry wide  as well as our own plans to increase both capital expenditure and research and development spending  are clear indicators of future growth

oilfield services fourth quarter results fourth quarter revenue of billion was higher sequentially and higher as compared to the fourth quarter of sequential revenue increases were highest in the middle east asia area led by the arabian  china japan korea and india geomarkets  followed by the latin america area where growth was strongest in the mexico central america  latin america south and peru colombia ecuador geomarkets 
in the europe cis africa area  increases were led by the north sea  caspian and continental europe geomarkets 
growth was also recorded in north america  led primarily by the canada and us gulf coast geomarkets 
among schlumberger technologies  artificial lift systems  completions systems and schlumberger information solutions sis registered strong growth due to seasonal end of year product sales 
fourth quarter pretax operating income of billion increased sequentially and as compared to the fourth quarter of sequentially  growth was driven by demand for higher margin drilling measurements services in the middle east asia area and by increased product sales in artificial lift systems in europe cis africa and middle east asia  and by completions systems product sales in the middle east asia and latin america 
however  these increases were offset by pricing erosion for well stimulation related activities on land in the us  exceptional weather related and operational delays in mexico central america  and weather and seasonal effects in the us west  north sea and east russia geomarkets 
these events resulted in an overall pretax operating margin in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the third quarter of 
table of contents part ii  item north america revenue of billion increased sequentially but decreased as compared to the fourth quarter of pretax operating income of million decreased sequentially and year on year 
sequentially  revenue in the canada geomarket continued to grow led by demand for well services and wireline technologies 
in the us gulf coast geomarket  activity partially recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter with higher demand for wireline  well testing and well services technologies 
in addition  higher sis product sales were recorded across the area 
this performance was largely offset by the continuing pricing erosion in well stimulation related activities in the us land geomarkets  seasonal land access constraints in the west  and by lower activity in alaska 
pretax operating margin for the area declined sequentially from to due to the lower pricing environment for well stimulation related services in the us land and canada geomarkets  as well as lower operating leverage in alaska and canada 
this was partially offset by a more favorable activity mix and higher operating efficiency in the us gulf coast geomarket together with the area wide sis product sales 
latin america revenue of million increased sequentially and as compared to the fourth quarter of pretax operating income of million increased sequentially and year on year 
sequential revenue growth was recorded in all geomarkets primarily driven by ipm activities in mexico central america  peru colombia ecuador and venezuela trinidad tobago 
increased demand for well testing technologies and higher sales of artificial lift systems  completions systems and sis products in latin america south  together with higher sales of artificial lift systems and completions systems products in the mexico central america and peru colombia ecuador geomarkets  also contributed to growth 
pretax operating margin declined sequentially from to primarily due to the activity mix in the mexico central america geomarket  which was affected by higher ipm project startup and third party costs as well as by flooding in the south and operational delays offshore 
these startup costs are expected to continue for the next few quarters 
a lower mix of higher margin drilling measurements activity in venezuela trinidad tobago and higher margin wireline technology in peru colombia ecuador also contributed to this result 
europe cis africa revenue of billion increased sequentially and as compared to the fourth quarter of pretax operating income of million was flat sequentially but increased year on year 
sequentially  the north sea geomarket recorded the highest revenue growth driven by increased demand for wireline and well services technologies together with higher artificial lift systems and sis product sales 
higher demand for drilling measurements technologies in the caspian geomarket  increased artificial lift systems product sales in north russia  and high demand for drilling measurements  well services and well testing technologies in continental europe also contributed to growth 
this performance was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin and subdued activity in nigeria 
pretax operating margin declined sequentially from to due to the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin  and to weather related delays which led to reduced demand for higher margin drilling measurements and well testing technologies in the north sea 
a less favorable activity mix in the west south africa and north africa geomarkets also contributed to this result 
middle east asia revenue of billion increased sequentially and as compared to the fourth quarter of pretax operating income of million increased sequentially and year on year 

table of contents part ii  item the sequential growth in revenue resulted from high demand for drilling measurements and wireline technologies together with higher completions systems  artificial lift systems and sis product sales in the arabian geomarket  higher demand for exploration related drilling measurements technologies and for artificial lift systems products in qatar  increased demand for drilling measurements and well testing services in china japan korea  and higher deepwater exploration driven demand for wireline and drilling measurements technologies together with higher sis product sales in india 
the pretax operating margin of as compared to in the third quarter resulted from the more favorable activity mix in the arabian and india geomarkets being offset by reduced demand for higher margin wireline  well services and well testing technologies in the indonesia  thailand vietnam and australia papua new guinea geomarkets 
total year results full year revenue of billion increased versus  led by area growth of in the middle east asia  followed by in europe cis africa and in latin america while north america remained essentially flat 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than pretax operating margins of improved basis points bps in versus higher activity and expansion of higher margin new technology deployment across europe cis africa  middle east asia and latin america areas were the principal contributors to this performance 
in north america  pricing erosion in pressure pumping well stimulation activities moderated year on year margin growth within the area 
among the geomarkets  the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the north sea  followed by mexico  west south africa  arabian and venezuela trinidad tobago geomarkets 
significant demand was seen for all technologies led by drilling measurements  wireline  well testing  and completions systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 
to adapt the existing schlumberger geomarket structure to expanding activity levels worldwide  qatar was established as a separate geomarket and new geomarkets were established in russia and on land in the us  bringing the total number of geomarkets to north america revenue of billion increased marginally over primarily due to higher demand for drilling measurements  well testing and wireline activities in the us land central  us land north and the us gulf coast geomarkets 
however  this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the area 
activity across us land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs 
however  weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation related pressure pumping capacity led to a year on year decline in pricing in stimulation related activities 
the us gulf coast geomarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities 
in canada year on year revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime 
pretax operating margin declined by bps to primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the area together with lower activity in canada 

table of contents part ii  item latin america revenue of billion in increased over led by a surge in ipm related activity in mexico following the budget related slowdowns in the previous year  followed by the growth in exploration related activities in the peru columbia ecuador and latin america south geomarkets 
the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket also grew with higher rig count driven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges 
the mexico geomarket recorded robust growth with the start of several integrated projects 
peru columbia ecuador and latin america south witnessed strong growth in exploration related activities 
demand was strong for all technologies led by ipm  followed by drilling measurements  wireline and well testing services 
pretax operating margin increased strongly by bps to reach 
this increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix and improved pricing 
europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the north sea  west south africa and north africa geomarkets 
strong revenue increases were recorded in the north sea  west south africa and north africa driven by the expansion of exploration related activities 
geomarkets in russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year 
pretax operating margins increased by bps to reach 
this performance was due to a combination of increased activity  improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most geomarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the east russia and subdued activity in nigeria 
middle east asia revenue of billion in increased over with the largest increases recorded in the arabian geomarket  followed by east mediterranean  australia papua new guinea  qatar  gulf and india 
the australia papua new guinea geomarket recorded the highest growth rate in the area driven by higher exploration related activity 
growth in east mediterranean  qatar  gulf and india resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the arabian geomarket continued to grow  albeit at a lower rate than the previous year  as new rig additions slowed down in saudi arabia 
pretax operating margin increased by bps to an impressive 
this performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of higher margin wireline and drilling measurements new technologies 
total year results revenue of billion increased in versus driven by growth in oilfield services activities as operators responded strongly to increasing global hydrocarbon demand through renewed exploration and increased focus on production operations 
within the geographic areas  north america revenue increased  europe cis africa increased  middle east asia increased and latin america increased 
pretax operating income of billion in grew by over resulting in operating margins climbing by bps to reach 
stronger activity  accelerating higher margin new technology deployment and increased pricing across all areas were the principal contributors to this performance 

table of contents part ii  item among the geomarkets  the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in us land  followed by the arabian  russian  north sea  us gulf coast  canada  west south africa  nigeria and north africa geomarkets 
the growth in russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established geomarkets and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 
significant demand was seen for all technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 
a number of key acquisitions were made during the year 
these included the acquisition of the outstanding of petroalliance services in russia  as well as terratek a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis  odegaard a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software  and reslink a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management  zonal isolation and intelligent well completions 
north america revenue of billion increased over mainly driven by the us land and us gulf coast geomarkets  which benefited from strong well services  drilling measurements and wireline activities coupled with continued pricing improvements 
increasing demand for well testing activities offshore also contributed to growth 
sharply increased activity in the us land geomarket led to strong equipment and personnel utilization  higher pricing and increased demand for high tier  new technology services 
the us gulf coast geomarket rebounded strongly from the effects of the disastrous hurricane season with growth driven by a combination of new exploration and increased production related activities 
canada continued to grow due to strong demand for drilling measurements and wireline technologies 
growth was somewhat offset by lower well services activity in the coal bed methane and shallow gas areas in the second half of the year 
pretax operating income of billion was higher than in led by the us land and us gulf of mexico geomarkets 
the steep growth was primarily due to continuing strength in pricing  particularly for well services  wireline and drilling measurements technologies  and a more favorable activity mix resulting from the deployment of higher margin new technology drilling measurements  wireline and well testing services 
latin america revenue of billion in increased over led by the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket  followed by the latin america south and peru colombia ecuador geomarkets 
growth in the area was impacted by budget related activity slowdowns in mexico together with geopolitical concerns in other parts of the region 
the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for drilling measurements technologies 
well services  wireline  completions and artificial lift technologies also contributed to growth 
in venezuela  discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year 
pending finalization of these new contracts  revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters 
as the costs associated with this work were also deferred  this did not have a significant impact on the area s pretax operating income 
the latin america south geomarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased well services  drilling measurements  ipm and well testing activities  while growth in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket resulted from significant demand for drilling measurements  wireline and artificial lift technologies 

table of contents part ii  item pretax operating income of million in increased versus this increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix in ipm projects and improved operating efficiencies in drilling measurements and well testing services 
europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the north sea  north africa  nigeria geomarkets and in russia 
strong revenue increases were recorded in russia and other cis countries despite the weather related slowdown in the first quarter  due to a combination of organic growth within schlumberger technology lines and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 
renewed customer focus on exploration resulted in steep growth in the north sea and north africa geomarkets  while the west south africa and nigeria geomarkets maintained a robust growth momentum 
pretax operating income of billion in increased compared to all geomarkets contributed significantly through increased activity  improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment 
middle east asia revenue of billion in increased over with the largest increases recorded in the arabian  east africa east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets 
saudi arabia continued aggressive growth rates as activity increased rapidly  distinguishing the arabian geomarket as the fastest growing of all of the geomarkets 
growth in the east africa east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets was principally attributed to higher activity in drilling measurements and wireline services 
the brunei malaysia philippines  australia papua new guinea and thailand vietnam myanmar geomarkets also contributed to growth 
all technologies witnessed solid growth as activity increased and demand for new technology increased with significant progress in the deployment of drilling measurements powerdrive and scope technologies to enable successful drilling of a number of complex borehole trajectories 
pretax operating income of billion in increased compared to the steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all geomarkets  significant price increases and accelerated new technology deployment 
westerngeco fourth quarter results fourth quarter revenue of million increased over the prior quarter and increased compared to the same period last year 
pretax operating income of million decreased sequentially but increased year on year 
sequentially  multiclient revenue increased due to higher sales in north america  africa and asia 
however  this increase was largely offset by a decrease in marine revenue due to vessel transits between projects  several vessel dry docks  and lower vessel utilization 
pretax operating margin declined sequentially from to as the high margin multiclient activity was more than offset by the lower marine vessel utilization

on july   the board of directors of schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before december  subject to market conditions 
this program was completed during the first quarter of on april   the board of directors of schlumberger approved another share repurchase program of up to million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before april  subject to market conditions  of which approximately million shares of common stock have been repurchased as of december  the following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during  and stated in thousands except per share amounts and prices total cost of shares purchased total number of shares purchased average price paid per share during  and  schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of  and  respectively 
on january   schlumberger announced that its board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per share effective commencing with the dividend payable on april  total dividends paid during  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow provided by operations was billion in  billion in and billion in these improvements were driven by the significant revenue and net income increases experienced in and capital expenditures  including multiclient seismic data costs  were billion in  billion in and billion in these increases were a result of the increased activity levels experienced in recent years 
capital expenditures  including multiclient seismic data costs  are expected to approach billion in schlumberger believes that at december   cash and short term investments of billion and available and unused credit facilities of billion were sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents part ii  item summary of major contractual commitments stated in millions payment period contractual commitments total after debt operating leases purchase obligations excludes future payments for interest 
includes amounts relating to the million of convertible debentures which are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business 
although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  except as described below under westerngeco purchase accounting  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 

table of contents part ii  item the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
westerngeco purchase accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  on april   schlumberger acquired the remaining minority interest in westerngeco from baker hughes incorporated for billion in cash 
as a result of this transaction  schlumberger attained ownership of westerngeco 
during the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values  schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for westerngeco s vessels and multiclient seismic data 
in analyzing the fair value of the westerngeco vessels  it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense 
therefore  the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional years on a weighted average basis as of the date of the acquisition 
the impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets  combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels  resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million in the carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to million from million  reflecting the impact of a million fair value adjustment 
these capitalized costs are being charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
schlumberger s policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 
after consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition  schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction  effectively resetting the minimum amortization period 
therefore  the million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next years from the date of the transaction 
surveys comprising the million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately years 
given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before a project commences  schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a year period 
therefore  schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction 
the net impact of the million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated 

table of contents part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
from time to time a third party valuation expert may assist in the determination of fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
in order to estimate the fair value of a long lived asset  schlumberger may engage a third party to assist with the valuation 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

table of contents part ii  item income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and for schlumberger s united states postretirement medical plans was increased from at december  to at december  the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from in to in the change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation  are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was in and a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both and was graded to over the next four years and thereafter 
the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  for the united states pension plans stated in millions change in assumption effect on pretax pension expense effect on dec

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
as a multinational company  schlumberger conducts its business in approximately countries 
schlumberger s functional currency is primarily the us dollar  which is consistent with the oil and gas industry 
approximately of schlumberger s revenue in was denominated in us dollars 
however  outside the united states  a significant portion of schlumberger s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies 
therefore  when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business  the us dollar reported expenses will increase 
a change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in would have changed revenue by approximately 
if the average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by  schlumberger s income from continuing operations would have increased by 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 
schlumberger maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assets liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 
at december   contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of billion in various foreign currencies 
these contracts mature on various dates in schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt 
schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps  where appropriate  to fix or lower borrowing costs 
at december   schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately billion 
schlumberger s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio 
both short term investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately billion at december   are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits  certificates of deposit and commercial paper  euronotes and eurobonds  and are substantially all denominated in us dollars
