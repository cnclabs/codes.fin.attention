cash flows provided by operations totaled million during the fiscal year ended august   compared to million provided by operations during the same prior year period

cash flows used in investing activities totaled million during the fiscal year ended august  compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million during the same prior year period

inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
during fiscal  the company incurred higher prices for purchases of certain commodities  in particular steel  used in the production of its products 
while the cost outlook for commodities used in the production of the company s products is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures by introducing appropriate sales price adjustments and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts  while further refining the company s inventory and raw materials risk management 
table of contents system

market conditions and fiscal outlook strong market conditions  including high agricultural commodity prices  high net farm income and increased demand for the company s highway safety and traffic mitigation products helped make fiscal yet another record setting year for lindsay 
as of the end of fiscal  the company s order backlog was at year end record levels 
in the irrigation segment  the company believes that global population growth will continue to drive the need for higher productivity from agriculture and improvements in the utilization of water resources 
in addition  environmental concerns regarding the run off of seeds and fertilizers used in agriculture  resulting from flood irrigated fields  continue to grow  which will drive the demand for more environmentally friendly solutions 
demand for the company s equipment will benefit from those drivers and from expanded use and development of biofuels 
today  the company s irrigation systems are used in growing most large acreage crops  including corn  where a growing amount of production has been used in ethanol production 
while there will be a growing demand for food and biofuels  there will also be growing demand for utilization of fresh water resources 
agricultural irrigation is the primary use of fresh water  globally  and the most common irrigation method in the world is flood or furrow irrigation  which uses  on average  twice as much water as an efficiently designed mechanical irrigation system 
the company expects that the increasing demands on fresh water resources will drive long term demand for the company s irrigation systems 
in the infrastructure segment  the company believes that population growth and economic development will continue to be the impetus for expansion in demand for the company s products 
the company s unique  patented  moveable barrier systems play a key role in reducing traffic congestion on bridges and roadways in major metropolitan areas around the world 
while the company s crash cushion revenues are more closely tied to new highway construction  most of the company s products in the infrastructure segment are roadway safety oriented 
the company expects to see continued emphasis  globally  on reducing the traffic mortality rates  and increasing investment in highway safety products 
most developing countries have a long way to go to catch up to the standards implemented in the us and europe  and the standards in developed countries are expected to further tighten 
as of august   at the end of the company s fiscal year  the company had an order backlog of million  an increase of from million at august  the irrigation segment backlog increased million million prior to the inclusion of watertronics on strong demand in the domestic and international markets 
the existing backlog represents a strong start to fiscal  and the orders in backlog will be filled primarily during the first quarter of fiscal approximately million of the order backlog represents orders from dealers for inventory  in anticipation of fall and spring demand 
payment for the dealer stock orders will be collected by the earlier of  approximately days after the units are sold to growers  or february  
table of contents at the end of fiscal  the company s balance sheet was in a positive net cash position  with million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short and long term debt 
the company also holds an unsecured million revolving credit note and revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na which  was fully available at year end and will primarily be used for working capital purposes and funding acquisitions 
the company believes these cash and credit resources are sufficient to meet the operating needs of the company 
entering fiscal  the company is now faced with instability in the global financial markets  global recessionary concerns  and a significant reduction in agricultural commodity prices 
these changes  which have occurred quite rapidly  may affect potential customers willingness to invest in agricultural irrigation equipment  and may impact government agencies ability to fund road and bridge infrastructure projects in the near term 
notwithstanding these current issues  the long term drivers for the company s products and services remain strong  and the company believes the financial resources and capabilities are sufficient to weather the instability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses these derivative instruments only to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
exposure to counterparty credit risk is considered low because the company s derivative instruments have been entered into with a creditworthy institution 
the company has manufacturing operations in the united states  france  brazil  italy and south africa 
the company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third party foreign suppliers 
export sales made from the united states are principally us dollar denominated 
accordingly  these sales are not subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk 
however  a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real  and the south african rand in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in order to reduce translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into us dollars  the company  at times  utilizes euro foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its euro net investment exposure in its foreign operations 
at august   the company had one outstanding euro foreign currency forward contract to sell million euro on november  at a fixed price of usd per euro 
the forward spot rate at august  was usd per euro 
the company s foreign currency forward contract qualifies as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations under the provisions of sfas no 
for the year ended august   the company received million related to gains for settled foreign currency forward contracts  which were included in other comprehensive income as a part of currency translation adjustment  net of tax 
in order to reduce interest rate risk on the million bsi term note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with wells fargo bank  na that converts the variable interest rate on the entire amount of these borrowings to a fixed rate of per annum 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
similarly  the company entered into a cross currency swap transaction fixing the conversion rate of euros to us dollars for the snoline term note at and obligating the company to make quarterly payments of million euros per quarter over the same seven year period as the snoline term note and to receive payments of million per quarter 
in addition  the variable interest rate has been converted to a fixed rate of 
this is approximately equivalent to converting the million seven year snoline term note into a million euro seven year term note at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the cross currency swap  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt
