overview we are a leading value added manufacturer of high quality  prepared frozen food products for branded retail  private label  foodservice and airline customers 
our product line includes entr es  plated meals  bulk packed meal components  pastas  soups  sauces  poultry  meat and fish specialties  and organic and vegetarian offerings 
our extensive research and development efforts  combined with our extensive catalogue of recipes and flexible manufacturing capabilities  provide customers with a one stop solution for new product ideas  formulations and product manufacturing  as well as precise replication of existing recipes 
our capabilities allow customers to outsource product development  product manufacturing and packaging  thereby avoiding significant fixed cost and variable investments in resources and equipment 
our customers include prominent nationally recognized names such as jenny craig  inc  h 
j 
heinz company  american airlines  inc  safeway inc  pinnacle foods group llc and panda restaurant group  inc our goal is to be a leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared frozen foods 
we intend to create superior value for our stockholders by continuing to execute our growth and operating strategies  including diversifying and expanding our customer base by focusing on sectors we believe have attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  operating and investing in efficient production facilities  providing value added ancillary support services to customers  offering a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels  and continuing to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions and investments 
during fiscal year  our net revenues increased significantly year on year due to the continued success of retail customer lines 
during the same time period  however  the prices for virtually all food related commodities  especially poultry  dairy and cheese  eggs  wheat  corn products and oils rose dramatically  some to historic levels 
wherever reasonably possible  we have locked in annual raw materials purchase prices by contracting volume to cover anticipated sales 
we are now in the process of negotiating several annual vendor and customer contracts  and we believe margins will improve through reduced purchase prices of raw materials  increased sales prices to customers and a change in mix of customers between retail  foodservice and airlines 
this is in line with our strategy to continue to reduce our reliance on a small number of key accounts and to improve margins 
following completion of plant no 
in april  we strategically filled available capacity with business that carried gross margins lower than our historical average 
with our recent growth  we have moved and intend to continue to move away from some accounts that do not meet our profit objectives towards higher margin business now available to us 
fiscal years  and were week periods 
for the fiscal year ended september  net revenues of million reflected a increase was attributed to volume mix increases and was attributed to pricing increases as compared to the fiscal year ended september  during fiscal year  increased sales in the retail category offset an expected decline in foodservice sales resulting from a customer s decision to diversify its source of suppliers as previously disclosed 
we experienced a increase in net revenues for the fiscal year ended september   to million  compared to million the fiscal year ended october  the increase in net revenues during fiscal year was also due to growth in our retail category 
gross profit was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues during fiscal year to from in fiscal year  after declining from in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenues recovered in fiscal year to near the fiscal year level due to higher margin sales along with on going manufacturing improvements  increased efficiencies and yields  improved and increased financial reviews and controls and modest increases in sales prices to several customers  offset partially by new product development costs 
the earlier decline in gross profit in dollars and as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to increases in raw materials and commodity costs as well as start up costs related to the launch of two new product lines  inefficiencies relating to production during our facility expansion and lower profit margins on panda restaurant group  inc s products 
as previously disclosed  in order to improve our gross profit margins  we continue to analyze our lower margin accounts in order to increase margins or change to more profitable business 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we ceased production for a customer that did not meet our profit objectives  and going forward  we intend to continue to focus on higher margin business 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended was compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year  due primarily to increased net revenues and improvements in gross profit margins as noted above 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues because we were able to administer a greater volume of business with little increase in staffing 
net income of million increased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal year versus in fiscal year and in fiscal year as described under liquidity and capital resources below  during fiscal year we refinanced our then existing debt of million 
the new credit facility with guggenheim corporate funding  llc gcf was a million senior secured credit facility with a five year maturity and was secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
on march   we executed a second amendment to the senior credit agreement allowing for million of additional financing for capital expenditures 
the facility is now a million senior secured credit facility and is structured as a million non amortizing revolving loan  a million amortizing tranche a term loan and a million non amortizing tranche b term loan

for fiscal year  the retail category as a percentage of net revenues increased to from 
during fiscal year  we entered into a five year licensing agreement with better living brands tm alliance alliance for the exclusive right to produce and sell frozen entr es under the eating right tm and o organics tm brands 
the mission of the alliance is to provide health and wellness food and beverage solutions via its two proven multi category lifestyle brands 
we agreed to pay a one time million licensing fee in two installments  of which we paid million in may and will pay the remaining  in may in addition  we paid a  royalty fee prepayment in may and the remaining  royalty prepayment in october the agreement is renewable for two five year terms 
for fiscal year  amortization expense related to the licensing fee was  we anticipate revenue from the licensing agreement to begin in fiscal year also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we rolled out an additional product line of items for safeway inc we anticipate realizing the full impact from the new business beginning in fiscal year foodservice net revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to anticipated reduced volume from one customer and softness in the foodservice industry caused by a slowing economy 
for fiscal year  the foodservice category as a percentage of net revenues decreased to from 
however  we continue our sales efforts in this category and believe that foodservice represents a significant opportunity for us in and beyond 
airline net revenues increased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in airline net revenues was primarily attributable to increases in passenger travel during the early part of fiscal year given record high fuel costs in and airline initiatives to cut costs  going forward we expect a decrease in airline net revenues 
for fiscal year  the airline category as a percentage of net revenues decreased to from as we are transitioning away to opportunities outside of this category 
although we anticipate continued growth in fiscal  the economic forecast for calendar will present challenges along with new business opportunities 
one of our retail customers  h 
j 
heinz company  has indicated that they will be self manufacturing a greater share of their volume requirements 
as a result  h 
j 
heinz company expects to move significant volume out of our facilities beginning january  we are currently projecting a revenue reduction of approximately million for the fiscal year  beginning in our second quarter 
we are in the process now of negotiating with h 
j 
heinz company for new volume and revised pricing for existing and future business 
safeway inc s eating right product line  which we began to produce in february  continues to perform well 
we have also launced a second line for safeway inc that is rolling out to all of their locations later in fiscal year in addition  we have reached an agreement with an existing foodservice customer  which provides for an increase of sales of approximately million over the prior fiscal year 
we believe other retail customers and foodservice opportunities will compensate for anticipated lost sales in both fiscal and calendar year gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year increased million to million  or of net revenues  from million  or of net revenues  for fiscal year gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was higher due to increased sales along with on going manufacturing improvements  increased efficiencies and yields  improved and increased financial reviews and controls and modest increases in sales prices to several customers  offset slightly by costs incurred for new product development 
in addition  in order to improve our gross profit margins  we continue to analyze our lower margin accounts and expect to move away from some of the accounts that do not meet our profit objectives towards higher margin business now available to us 
during fiscal year  we were notified by the us department of agriculture of a recall of beef produced by the hallmark westland meat packing co 
the recall was classified as class ii  meaning the risks of health and or safety issues were remote 
we purchased a small amount of raw beef directly from hallmark westland during the fiscal year and manufactured it into finished goods that were eventually destroyed 
we were subsequently informed that a larger amount of cooked beef was purchased from another vendor a vendor mandated by a customer that had originally purchased raw beef from hallmark westland 
as a result of this government mandated recall  we destroyed or approved destruction of approximately  cases of product resulting in a charge to cost of sales of approximately million during fiscal year gross profit margin was negatively affected by less than 
we believe that we have areas of recourse to recover all or part of the losses incurred relating to the recall 
any recovery will be recorded in subsequent periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased  or to million  or of net revenues  for fiscal year from million  or of net revenues  for fiscal year sg a expenses were driven by higher brokerage fees due to higher retail sales  increased salaries and higher legal fees associated with the claims filed against american pie  llc as noted in the other matters section below 
these increases were partially offset by lower professional service fees  primarily related to a  decrease in fees for sarbanes oxley requirements 
operating income 
operating income increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in operating income was the result of improvements in net revenues and gross profit margins as noted above

net income 
net income for fiscal year was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share for fiscal year we currently expect to continue profitable operations primarily through a growing revenues from profitable product lines  increasing our customer base and replacing lower margin accounts  b improving gross margins by increasing prices to customers where appropriate  streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage our manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  and c reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt through permitted pre payments on our debt 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these initiatives 
as discussed in risk factors contained in item a of this report  we may be unable to improve our operating results if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  declines in air travel  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business

retail net revenues increased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in retail net revenues was due in part to the launch of new private label items in february for safeway inc in addition  we entered into a new agreement with hj heinz company  which was announced in january foodservice net revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year in january  panda restaurant group  inc communicated its intentions to transfer million in annual foodservice production volume from us to another vendor 
as this transfer was delayed  the decrease in sales to this customer during fiscal year was approximately million rather than million as previously announced 
airline net revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decline in airline net revenues was primarily attributable to the loss of sales to delta airlines subsequent to its bankruptcy filing 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year decreased million to million  or of net revenues  from million  or of net revenues  for fiscal year the decrease in margins was attributable to higher raw materials and commodity costs  start up costs relating to simultaneously launching two new product lines  inefficiencies related to production during our facility expansion  and lower profit margins on panda s products 
as noted above  panda did not transition all of the million of business to alternate suppliers as planned 
panda asked us to increase our production volume after chicken contracts were in place for the fiscal year 
as we were required to purchase non contracted chicken at higher spot market costs  our margins were negatively affected 
selling  general and administrative expenses

interest expense 
interest expense decreased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year interest expense declined million from million to million due to lower interest rates as a result of the refinancing in fiscal year and from the capitalization of interest of  on borrowings used in the construction of new plant capacity and line efficiency projects that occurred in fiscal year income tax provision

net income 
net income for fiscal year was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash increased million to million at september  from million at september  our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities and availability under our credit facility described below 
during the fiscal year ended september   our operating activities provided cash of million  compared to cash provided of million during the fiscal year ended september  we used operating cash flows to finance working capital needs primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable of million during fiscal year accounts receivable decreased by  inventory declined by  which reflects the results of our efforts to increase inventory turns 
cash used by prepaid expenses and other assets was million during fiscal year and related primarily to the alliance licensing and royalty agreement discussed above 
in addition  cash provided by accrued liabilities was  during fiscal year at september   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at september  we were able to fund our growth in sales during fiscal year internally  without increasing our external debt  by executing the cash management procedures noted above 
during fiscal year  our investing activities  consisting of additions to capital expenditures and marketable securities  resulted in a net use of cash of approximately million  compared to a net use of cash of approximately million during fiscal year the decrease in cash used was due to prior year additions of property and equipment related to the expansion of the manufacturing capacity of our entr e plant to accommodate additional business opportunities  meet anticipated growth and improve operating efficiency 
the additions to property and equipment were partially offset by  in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities during fiscal year  compared to  during fiscal year we anticipate that cash generated from operating activities and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities will fund revenue growth and working capital needs in the near term 
to continue our current growth rate into fiscal year  we will need additional capacity either through acquisition of another facility or another business within the next twelve months  which likely would result in a large use of cash 
we believe that our cash and financial liquidity positions are sufficient to fund current working capital needs and future growth initiatives 
our current financing  at favorable interest rates  is in place into we have an available revolving line of credit of million  which we believe is adequate to meet immediate requirements 
we are scheduled to make an excess cash prepayment of million on our tranche a debt prior to calendar year end 
we intend to reduce our debt with regularly scheduled debt reduction payments and additional voluntary prepayments where liquidity and loan agreements allow 
during fiscal year  our financing activities used cash of million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal year the net use of cash was due to principal payments on debt  equipment loans and our capital lease obligation of million   and  respectively  as we paid down our revolving loan balance to zero during the second quarter of fiscal year the principal payments were offset by borrowings of million and receipt of  from the exercise of employee stock options  including the related tax benefit

at september   interest rates on the tranche a term loans and tranche b term loans were and  respectively 
as of june   our total debt to ebitda ratio for the last twelve months was less than and  therefore  we qualified for the lowest applicable margin for the alternative base rate and libor loans  which was applicable to our borrowing beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million in interest expense net of  in capitalized interest 
over the term of the loan  the facility had been reduced by mandatory principal payments on the tranche a term loan of million and voluntary principal payments on the tranche b term loan of million

sfas requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas became effective for our fiscal year that began on september  we currently are evaluating the impact adoption may have on our financial condition or results of operations

revised sfas r  business combinations  which replaces fasb statement sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired

sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we currently are evaluating the impact adoption may have on our financial condition or results of operations relating to potential future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for noncontrolling interests  which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently are evaluating the impact adoption may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
unlike statement on auditing standards no 
the meaning of present fairly in conformity with gaap  sfas is directed to the entity rather than the auditor 
the statement is effective in fiscal year  and we do not expect its adoption to impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform on going credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customer could impact its future ability to satisfy its receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically have been relatively small  as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from four customers 
jenny craig  inc  h 
j 
heinz company  panda restaurant group  inc and safeway inc 
accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year and approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year receivables related to jenny craig  inc  h 
j 
heinz company  panda restaurant group  inc through its distributors and safeway inc 
accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our total accounts receivable balance at september  and approximately   and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and write it down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
we write down our inventory for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products and discontinued items and components 
we determine the amount of the write down by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases in the write down of our inventory 
property and equipment 
the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements to our plant no 
in vernon  california are amortized over the lesser of the initial lease term plus one lease extension period  initially totaling years  or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method 
we assess property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of materials purchased and labor expended in betterments and major renewals are capitalized 
costs and related accumulated depreciation of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposals are included in operating income 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at september   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty of income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on october  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was zero at september  we have also adopted the accounting policy that interest recognized in accordance with paragraph of fin and penalties recognized in accordance with paragraph of fin are classified as part of income taxes 
no interest and penalties were recognized in the statement of income for fiscal year other matters we manufactured for one of our customers  american pie  llc  who distributes products under the name claim jumper  pursuant to a written manufacturing agreement that expired automatically on april  thereafter  we manufactured for the customer on a purchase order basis pursuant to increased prices for some products 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we informed the customer that we intended to discontinue production for them 
the decision was based on our evaluation of the overall economics of that account 
the customer represented it would pay price increases for continued manufacturing during a transition period to a new manufacturer 
after completing production for the customer in june  the customer withheld payment of approximately million for product produced and shipped pursuant to the customer s purchase orders 
the customer has made certain claims  including the claim that the customer should not have paid the price increases to which it earlier agreed 
based on information available at this time  and prior to discovery in the litigation referenced below  we consider the customer s claims to lack merit 
after several discussions and subsequent to the closing of our third fiscal quarter  the customer made a partial payment of approximately million against the outstanding receivable balance 
however  prior to fiscal year end  the customer still refused payment of the remaining outstanding receivable balance and we filed a lawsuit against the customer as of september  overhill farms  inc v

this action involves a complaint by us against customer american pie and two of its officers  william r
