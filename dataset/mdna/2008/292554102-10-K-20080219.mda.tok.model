portfolio revenue consists of accretion revenue and zero basis revenue 
accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
all collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered zero basis portfolios are recorded as revenue zero basis revenue 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for certain debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
servicing fee revenue is revenue primarily associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from our subsidiary  ascension capital group  inc ascension  a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 
the following tables summarize collections  revenue  end of period receivable balance and other related supplemental data by year of purchase in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  as of december  collections net revenue revenue recognition rate of total revenue net impairment unamortized balance monthly irr zba total for the year ended december  as of december  collections net revenue revenue recognition rate of total revenue net impairment reversal unamortized balance monthly irr zba total does not include amounts collected on behalf of others 
gross collections and revenue related to the retained interest are included in these tables 
total revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  revenue  excluding ascension s bankruptcy servicing fees for and of million and million  respectively  increased million  or  to million 
the increase in portfolio revenue was primarily the result of additional accretion revenue associated with higher purchasing volumes in compared to and increased accretion revenue related to new operating initiatives 
the increase in portfolio revenue was partially offset by a greater impairment on receivable portfolios  lower revenue recognition rates and a reduction in zero basis revenue 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million  including a million impairment on our healthcare receivables in connection with exiting our healthcare purchasing and collecting activities  compared to a net impairment provision of million in the prior year 
the increase in the impairment provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to three factors 
first  in the fourth quarter  we experienced a shortfall in collections against our forecast  a large percentage of which came from our older pool groups  which have very high monthly irrs 
second  during the last two quarters of  we experienced a trend in which a larger percentage of collections from our legal channel came from multi payment settlements versus single payment settlements 
given the high irrs in our older pool groups  when payments are extended over a longer period of time and the cash flows are delayed  this generally results in an impairment provision  even if we receive the collections in the future 
despite this recent trend in the shift in payment types from single payment settlements to multi payment settlements in our legal channel  we have not experienced any material shifts in our overall payer rates or settlement rates 
finally  since it is reasonable to assume that current economic conditions will have some negative impact on consumers willingness or ability to repay their accounts  we felt it was prudent to reduce some of our near term forecasted collections  which resulted in an increase to the impairment provision 
the lower revenue recognition rates were due to a greater portion of our collections coming from our to portfolio purchases that have lower revenue recognition rates than our and prior purchases  due to a more competitive pricing environment since during the year ended december   million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest was recognized as zero basis revenue  a million decrease from the million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest recognized during the year ended december  the reduction in zero basis revenue was primarily the result of the sale of certain receivables portfolios in from zero basis portfolios and an expected reduction in collections from zero basis portfolios 
in  we sold accounts amounting to approximately billion in face value for million 
this sale resulted in additional zero basis revenue of million for the year ended december  additionally  we expect the revenue from our zero basis portfolios to decline in future quarters as collections from these portfolios diminish 
revenue associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from ascension  a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry  was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the decrease in ascension revenue was due to the high volume of bankruptcy placements in october just prior to the effective date of the bankruptcy reform act the act 
consistent with our revenue recognition policy  the revenue associated with the significant number of chapter bankruptcy placements in october was recognized during the year ended december  we have experienced a significant decline in bankruptcy placements since the effective date of the act 
although bankruptcy placements have not returned to the levels experienced prior to the act  they have increased gradually from the low levels experienced in late and during the year ended december   we invested million to acquire portfolios with face values aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million increase  or  in the amount invested compared with the million invested during the year ended december   to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  operating expenses are explained in more detail as follows salaries and employee benefits total salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in severance expenses largely associated with the reduction in our workforce and the decision to exit our healthcare purchasing and collection activities  offset by decreases of million in salary and wages  million in bonuses  million in payroll taxes and million in health insurance costs due to reduced headcount as a result of the reduction in workforce in september stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of approximately million of expenses related to changes in assumptions used in calculating our stock based compensation  a reduction in expense of million resulting from forfeited shares and a reduction in expense of million resulting from stock options fully vested during the year ended december   offset by additional expenses of million associated with new equity grants issued during the year ended december  and million associated with a modification of certain stock options 
cost of legal collections the cost of legal collections increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  these costs represent contingent fees paid to our nationwide network of attorneys and costs of litigation 
the increase in contingent fees was primarily the result of an increase of million  or  in gross collections through our legal channel 
gross legal collections amounted to million during the year ended december   compared to million collected during the year ended december  the cost of legal collections increased as a percent of gross collections through this channel to during the year ended december   from during the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased upfront court costs expensed associated with our pursuit of legal collections 
upfront court costs expensed were million for the year ended december   including a reduction in expense of million in connection with a change in our expected recovery rate 
upfront court costs expensed were million for the year ended december  see legal outsourcing collections and related costs under supplemental performance data for further discussion of cost of legal collections 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in ascension s legal expense  a decrease in the amortization of a previously acquired deferred revenue asset  a decrease in skiptracing expenses  and a decrease in recruiting expenses  offset by an increase in the number of direct mail campaigns and its related expense 
ascension s legal expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  amortization of a previously acquired deferred revenue asset decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  skiptracing expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  recruiting expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  the cost of direct mail campaigns increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   compared to million during year ended december  collection agency commissions during the year ended december   we paid million in commissions to third party collection agencies  or of the related gross collections of million  compared to million in commissions  or of the related gross collections of million  during the year ended december  the decrease in commissions is consistent with the decrease in collections through this channel 
the increase in commission rate as a percentage of the related gross collection is primarily the result of the mix of accounts placed with the agencies 
commissions  as a percentage of collections in this channel  vary from period to period depending on  among other things  the time from charge off of the accounts placed with an agency 
generally  freshly charged off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of approximately million of increased accounting and consulting service fees related to the filing of our state tax returns  a million net increase in general corporate expenses and million of increased building rent  offset by a million decrease in costs associated with the strategic alternatives process  and a million decrease in litigation settlement costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  depreciation expense remained consistent at million during the years ended december  and amortization expense relating to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of ascension in the third quarter of was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the following table summarizes our interest expense in thousands for the years ended december  change change stated interest on debt obligations amortization of loan fees and other loan costs subtotal contingent interest pay off of future contingent interest total interest expense as of december   we no longer made borrowings under our secured financing facility

prior to may   we shared with the lender the residual collections on purchases made under this facility  net of servicing fees paid to us 
the residual collections paid to the lender were classified as contingent interest 
on may   we entered into an agreement with the lender under our secured financing facility to eliminate all future contingent interest payments  for a one time payment of million 
this agreement released the lender s security interests in the remaining receivables originally financed under the secured financing facility 
this payment  less million accrued on our balance sheet million  or million after the effect of income taxes  is included in total other expense in our statement of operations for the year ended december  the charge reduced earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  subsequent to the second quarter of  we are no longer obligated to pay any contingent interest expense under the secured financing facility and  as a result  no longer record such interest in our statements of operations 
during  we entered into a three year revolving credit facility  to be used for the purposes of purchasing receivable portfolios and for general working capital needs 
this revolving credit facility has been amended several times to meet our needs  and is due to expire in may we have financed portfolio purchases subsequent to december   using our revolving credit facility  which does not require the sharing of residual collections with the lender 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on our revolving credit facility 
other income and expense during the year ended december   total other income was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in other income was primarily attributable to the realization of previously unrecognized gains of million associated with the plan assets of our non qualified employee benefit plan  offset by a million decrease associated with the change in the value of plan assets and plan liabilities 
during the year ended december   we liquidated all of our mutual funds within the plan assets 
as a result  previously unrealized investment gains of million were recognized as other income 
as of december   investments in plan assets consist only of company owned life insurance 
for this investment  the change in the cash surrender value of the insurance policies is recognized in earnings 
provision for income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an effective rate of of pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   consists primarily of a provision for federal income taxes of which is net of a benefit for state taxes of  a blended provision for state taxes of  a provision for the effect of permanent book versus tax differences of  and a benefit of relating to state taxes 
the benefit is primarily due to a new effective state tax rate resulting from the receipt of a favorable ruling from a state tax authority granting us the right to use a more favorable filing methodology  a net beneficial adjustment of million to the state and federal tax payables resulting from the completion of our state tax returns  a beneficial adjustment to our deferred taxes and the recognition of the benefit of certain state net operating losses generated in for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an effective rate of of pretax income 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of state taxes  permanent book versus tax differences  and the effect of an anticipated adjustment related to an internal revenue service tax audit of our income tax return 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was the result of the changing mix of permanent book versus tax differences relative to taxable income  offset by the increase in tax expense related to the tax audit issue noted above

this sale resulted in additional zero basis revenue of million and additional contingent interest expense of million 
the net impact of this sale was to increase pretax income for the year ended december  by million  net income by million and fully diluted earnings per share by 
since the sale of these accounts accelerated collections from future years into  future years collections and the related revenue  operating expenses and contingent interest expense associated with the pool groups from which these accounts were sold  will be reduced

inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three years ended december    and  since inflation rates have generally remained at relatively low levels and our operations are not otherwise uniquely affected by inflation concerns 
critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios 
commencing january   we began accounting for our investment in receivable portfolios in accordance with the provisions of sop sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment  or cost basis  in the pool 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
all portfolios with common risk characteristics purchased prior to the adoption of sop were aggregated by quarter of purchase 
in compliance with sop  we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an effective interest rate  or internal rate of return irr to the cost basis of the pool  which is to remain level  or unchanged throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s effective interest rate over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the effective interest rate  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction in revenue with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios as cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
contingent interest 
prior to may   under the terms of the our secured financing facility  once we repaid the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collected sufficient amounts to recoup our initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we shared the residual collections contingent interest from the receivable portfolios  net of servicing fees  with the lender 
we made estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we recorded a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 
on may   we entered into an agreement with the lender under our secured financing facility to eliminate all future contingent interest payments  for a one time payment of million 
subsequent to that date  we are no longer obligated to make any contingent interest payments under the secured financing facility and as a result  no longer record such interest in our statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on contingent interest 
deferred revenue 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension 
ascension provides bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle secured loans  on which the debtor has filed for chapter or bankruptcy 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew for yearly periods 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the time of account referral 
this initial fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the entire bankruptcy process resulting in the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used instead of actual closure dates 
therefore  the total financial consideration less efforts applied to litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule is recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension is to ensure that the client s claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of ascension s client  and to monitor and or collect the debtor payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy placements is thirty five months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is recognized ratably  including any upfront fees received by the company over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event  with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter and bankruptcy placements is reviewed periodically for changes 
convertible notes hedge 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes due september  the convertible notes 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  we purchased call options to purchase shares of our common stock and sold warrants to sell shares of our our common stock to the parties to which the convertible notes were issued 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  we recorded the net call options and warrants as a reduction in additional paid in capital as of december   and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the call options and warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
forward flow asset 
in connection with our acquisition of a business in june  we entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs over the next five years at a fixed price 
we allocated million of the acquisition purchase price to this agreement  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as forward flow asset 
we allocate a portion of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolio purchases under the forward flow agreement based on the proportion the purchase represents to the total purchase commitment  as adjusted for the time value of money 
we allocated million of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolios purchased during the year ended december  as part of this forward flow agreement  the seller is obligated to sell a predetermined minimum amount of charged off credit card accounts to us 
the forward flow agreement contains penalty provisions if the seller fails to meet such minimum requirements 
any monies received pursuant to such penalty provisions would be applied to the carrying balance of the forward flow asset 
we routinely evaluate the forward flow asset carrying balance for impairment 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has  to date  been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  or recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 
see changes in accounting estimate below for further discussion of deferred court costs 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have hedged the cash flows of a portion of our long term debt by entering into two separate interest rate swap agreements  with an intention to more effectively manage our exposure to interest rate changes by establishing a set level of fixed interest rates 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedge activities  as amended fas in the second quarter of fas requires that qualifying derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative  if any  is recognized in interest expense in the period of change 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r 
under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards  which is consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
we had elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by fas r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of fas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires us to record stock based compensation expense for all new and unvested stock options and restricted stock units that are ultimately expected to vest  as the requisite service is rendered  beginning january  stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to january   is based on the grant date fair value as determined under the pro forma provisions of fas in accordance with fas r  beginning in the first quarter of  we have presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock based compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which establishes recognition and measurement thresholds that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
effective january   we adopted the accounting provisions of fin we were not required to record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
changes in accounting estimate we capitalize deferred court costs in our consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will be ultimately uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  recovered  or we anticipate recovering 
when we first developed our analysis of court cost methodology  we had limited historical collection data with which to accurately model projected court cost recoveries beyond months 
with additional court cost recovery data accumulated over the last several years  we now have enough history to extend our recovery period to months and have done so prospectively beginning october  in connection with this change and with the availability of additional recovery data  we have also enhanced our methodology in determining the recovery rates used in calculating our reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
this change in our court costs reserve methodology is treated as a change in estimate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this change in estimate resulted in a one time reduction in pre tax expense and an increase in our deferred court cost asset of million  an increase in our net income of million  and an increase in our earnings per share of for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
subsequently  the fasb also issued fas  application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement we are currently analyzing the effects of the new standard and its potential impact  if any  on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  fas permits entities to account for most financial instruments at fair value rather than under other applicable generally accepted accounting principles such as historical cost 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the company is currently analyzing the effects of the new standard and its potential impact  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations 
the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
we will adopt this new standard for fiscal years beginning january  in december   the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement is effective prospectively  except for certain retrospective disclosure requirements  for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently analyzing the effects of the new standard and its potential impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
special note on forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which we believe are subject to certain safe harbors 
many statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated into this annual report on form k are forward looking statements 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  intend  plan  will  may  and similar expressions often characterize forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of collections  revenues  income or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
in particular  these statements may be found  among other places  under the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business  and risk factors sections 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we caution that these expectations or predictions may not prove to be correct or we may not achieve the financial results  savings or other benefits anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgement of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control or cannot be predicted or quantified  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
many factors  including but not limited to those set forth in this annual report on form k under part i  item a 
risk factors  could cause our actual results  performance  achievements  or industry results to be very different from the results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by other factors besides those listed here 
however  these are the risks we currently believe are material 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new information or future events  or for any other reason even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements will not be realized 
in addition  it is our policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings  and we do not endorse projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  of which million was subject to variable interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december   of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december
