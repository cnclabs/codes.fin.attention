non us orders increased and included a increase in sales of products manufactured outside of the us  and increases in us exports in safety and security systems and environmental solutions 
the growth in non us orders also reflects favorable currency effects due to a weaker us dollar 
us municipal and government orders increased in as a result of high demand for sweepers and sewer cleaners 
us industrial and commercial orders increased on continued strength in industrial vacuum trucks and waterblasters 
the substantial increase in non us orders includes a large fire truck order for montreal  canada

operating income increased and operating margins increased year over year  on a gross profit increase 
pricing and volume gains overcame higher material and component costs to flow through to earnings 
offsetting the increase in gross profit  was an increase in operating expenses relating to higher sales commissions and selling related expenses  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million and incentive bonuses  at various levels throughout the company  of million 
additionally  a gain of million from the sale of an industrial lighting product line reduced operating expenses in interest expense increased from  primarily as a result of higher interest rates and a greater mix of floating rate debt

net income in included an million loss from discontinued operations versus a million loss in discontinued operations in included the profitable cutting tool operations of the tool reporting segment  which were sold in january also included in discontinued operations are the operations of the north american refuse truck body business operating under the leach brand name 
substantially all of the assets of the leach business were sold during the second half of safety and security systems operations the following table presents the safety and security systems group s results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  in millions total orders us orders non us orders net sales operating income operating margin orders increased over with strength across most market segments 
us orders rose due to strength in light bars and sirens for both police and fire customers

non us orders increased over the prior year on strength in vehicular warning and police products  and the addition of pips technologies 
net sales increased with broad based improvement across the business  particularly for energy related markets 
the mid year addition of pips technologies automated license plate recognition alpr cameras added to sales for the year 
operating income increased over the comparable period 
the operating margin remained at as higher income from the flow through of higher sales volume that includes the addition of pips technologies  improved pricing  and favorable foreign currency movement were offset by increased costs 
table of contents associated with expanding the product portfolio and market reach 
results were also adversely impacted by higher implementation costs associated with profitable large airport parking systems 
orders improved in over the comparable period in with strength across all major product lines  including industrial signaling and communications  hazardous area lighting  police products  warning systems  and parking systems 
net sales increased over  on increased volumes across all product lines  with the exception of airport parking systems  and despite the absence of million of revenue from two industrial lighting product lines which were divested in the third quarter of operating income decreased in and a lower reported operating margin resulted from the inclusion of a million gain on the sale of the industrial lighting product lines in excluding the gain and the operations of the disposed product lines  the operating margin increased slightly  on higher sales volume and improved pricing  offset by higher compensation related charges 
fire rescue operations the following table presents the fire rescue group s results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  in millions total orders us orders non us orders net sales operating income loss operating margin orders in were up over the prior year on continued strong demand and a richer mix of bronto articulated aerial devices 
orders for e one products declined in the first months of the year due to disruptions in the north american dealer channel and changes in leadership 
during the second half of the year  transitions to several new dealers to expand coverage over these territories took place 
us export orders were down slightly  compared to the prior year  due to a large order for montreal  canada in net sales in the year declined from the prior year as lower e one fire apparatus volumes more than offset the growth in international sales of bronto aerial units 
the operating loss incurred in is related to the lower sales volume and lower manufacturing absorption experienced at e one 
bronto s higher production volume and favorable currency movement were not sufficient to overcome e one s shortfall 
the deterioration in the operating margin from the prior year reflects the lower volume of fire trucks produced and sold in orders in improved over  on strong aerial product demand in the bronto articulated aerial apparatus business  particularly in the european and asian markets as these platforms increasingly displace traditional ladders 
the decline in us orders reflects effects of continuing changes in the company s dealer channel structure and policies 
sales increased over the same period in  on higher realized pricing across all product lines mainly due to pricing actions taken in to recover escalating material costs  and due to currency translation on non us dollar denominated orders 
partially offsetting these increases was the adverse impact of lower shipments from the ocala production facility 
the operating income increase in included a million benefit from the recovery of costs from certain suppliers relating to a large contract substantially completed in the benefit was partially offset by million of costs incurred for the closure of a production facility in red deer  alberta

us orders increased over the prior year due to solid demand for industrial vacuum trucks and the impact of higher priced chassis associated with new epa standards 
non us orders increased driven by stronger us exports of sewer cleaners and industrial vacuum trucks primarily to the middle east 
net sales compared to grew on higher unit volumes of primarily vacuum trucks and overall higher pricing due in part to higher priced chassis 
operating income improved modestly over the comparable period however  the operating margin in declined as the favorable benefits of higher pricing and sales volume were more than offset by increased chassis costs  temporarily high material costs  new product development  erp implementation  product launches and initiatives to increase manufacturing efficiency 
in  orders increased over  showing strength and improvement across all product lines  most notably in street sweepers and vacuum trucks 
sales increased over the prior year on volume strength  higher pricing to offset increases in material and component costs and favorable currency movement 
operating income increased over the operating margin benefited from the flow through of increased product demand and pricing and an improvement in production cost absorption  offset by elevated operating costs incurred from executing growth initiatives  including advancing the erp system implementation  global expansion  and new product development 
tool operations the following table presents the tool group s results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  in millions total orders us orders non us orders net sales operating income operating margin orders and net sales in declined and  respectively  from the comparable period in  with weaker die and mold sales impacted by the weak domestic automotive and housing markets

table of contents us orders remained flat in  and non us orders contracted marginally 
sales were similarly impacted 
all businesses continue to feel the impact of a weak automotive market and softness in the us housing market 
operating income declined partially as a result of approximately million of costs associated with a voluntary workforce reduction at the dayton  ohio plant in in addition  a business system conversion implementation error identified in resulted in approximately million of incremental costs associated with lost productivity during the first half of these events affected the operating margin by percentage points  and have since been satisfactorily resolved

the reimbursement essentially offset the legal expenses in associated with this litigation

the company believes that its municipal financial services assets  due to their high overall quality  are capable of sustaining a high leverage ratio 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio for its financial services activities was at both december  and in  the company s aggregate borrowing capacity was maintained 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for will approximate million and that its financial resources and major sources of liquidity  including cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity  will be adequate to meet its operating and capital needs in addition to its financial commitments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents a summary of the company s contractual obligations and payments due by period as of december  in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term obligations long term debt operating lease obligations fair value of interest rate swaps interest payments on long term debt total contractual obligations the company is party to various interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the management of borrowing costs 
as of december   the fair value of the company s net position would result in cash payments of million 
future changes in the us interest rate environment would correspondingly affect the fair value and ultimate settlement of the contracts 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against the variability in exchange rates on cash flows of its foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   there is no unrealized gain or loss on the company s foreign exchange contracts 
volatility in the future exchange rates between the us dollar and euro and canadian dollar will impact the final settlement 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of the company s commercial commitments and the notional amount by expiration period in millions notional amount by expiration period less than total year years years financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit purchase obligations guaranteed residual value obligations funding to support china joint venture total commercial commitments financial standby letters of credit largely relate to casualty insurance policies for the company s workers compensation  automobile  general liability and product liability policies 
performance standby letters of credit represent guarantees of performance by foreign subsidiaries that engage in cross border transactions with foreign customers 
purchase obligations relate to commercial chassis and aerial turntables 
in limited circumstances  the company guarantees the residual value on vehicles in order to facilitate a sale 
the company believes its risk of loss is low  no losses have been incurred to date 
the inability of the company to enter into these types of arrangements in the future due to unforeseen circumstances is not expected to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the company s expected payment for significant contractual obligations includes approximately million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for this liability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
inventory reserve the company performs ongoing evaluations to ensure that reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are properly identified and recorded 
the reserve balance includes both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves at are established based on the identification of separately identifiable obsolete products and materials 
general reserves for materials are established based upon formulas which are established by reference to  among 
table of contents other things  the level of current inventory relative to recent usage  estimated scrap value and the level of estimated future usage 
historically  this reserve policy has given a close approximation of the company s experience with excess and obsolete inventory 
the company does not foresee a need to revise its reserve policy in the future 
however  from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve balance 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on the terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty costs as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the increase in the rate in is primarily due to increased costs in the fire rescue business 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
after the claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to resolve the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from hearing loss litigation see note contained in item of this form k  if the company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the appropriate time 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  sfas no 
also requires the company to test these assets annually for impairment  the company performs this test in the fourth quarter unless impairment indicators arise earlier 
the company continues to amortize definite lived intangible assets over their useful life 
a review for impairment requires judgment in estimated cash flows based upon estimates of future sales  operating income  working capital improvements and capital expenditures 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required against the unit s goodwill 

table of contents the annual testing conducted in  and did not result in any impairment 
although management believes that the assumptions and estimates used were reasonable  a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit is performed along with the impairment test 
the analysis indicated that a change in the operating margin assumption would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment in any group 
postretirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 
the following table summarizes the impact that a change in these assumptions would have on the company s operating income 
in millions assumption change basis basis point increase point decrease discount rate return on assets increase in employee compensation levels the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to published high quality bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure us pension liabilities decreased from in to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation expense effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including the company s stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we base the assumption on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  sfas no 
r also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
therefore  only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we revise the rate if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency options and forward contracts 
the 
table of contents company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within established percentages of between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
of the company s debt at december   was used to support financial services assets  the weighted average remaining life of those assets is typically under three years and the debt is substantially match funded to the financing assets

foreign exchange rate risk the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates 
the company utilizes foreign currency options and forward contracts to manage these risks
