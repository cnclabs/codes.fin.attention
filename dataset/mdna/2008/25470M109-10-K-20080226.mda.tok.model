item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the improvement in free cash flow from to of million resulted from an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of million  or  and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of million  or 
the increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income  net of changes in i deferred tax expense benefit  ii gain on insurance settlement  and iii depreciation and amortization expense 
a million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures  including satellite construction  and equipment under our new subscriber lease program  partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program 
our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy  strategic opportunities or other factors 
cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including sling media  fcc licenses and capital expenditures  partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of marketable investment securities during the decrease in cash flow from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities  partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during cash flow from investing activities for was favorably impacted by a million insurance settlement 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt  and capital lease obligations  mortgages or other notes payable  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of billion 
the decrease in cash flow from financing activities from to of billion principally resulted from the following during february  we redeemed billion principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due during february  we sold billion principal amount of our senior notes due and redeemed the remaining million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due during october  we sold million principal amount of our senior notes due and redeemed the million outstanding principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due during  we repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in cash flow from financing activities from to of billion principally resulted from the transactions discussed above 
the repurchases of our class a common stock unfavorably impacted compared to we repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of million during compared to  shares at a cost of million during other liquidity items auction of spectrum for new services 
the fcc announced on january  that we were qualified to participate in the fcc auction of the mhz band 
the mhz spectrum is being returned by television broadcasters as they move to digital from analog signals in early the spectrum has significant commercial value because mhz signals can travel long distances and penetrate thick walls 
under the fcc s anti collusion and anonymous bidding rules for this auction  we are not permitted to disclose publicly our interest level or activity level in the auction  if any  at this time 
based on published reports  however  we believe that any successful bidders will be required to expend significant amounts to secure and commercialize these licenses 
in particular if we were to participate and be successful in this auction we could be required to raise additional capital in order to secure and commercialize these licenses  which may not be available to us on attractive terms in the current credit market environment 
moreover  there can be no assurance that successful bidders will be able to achieve a return on their investments in the mhz spectrum or to raise all the capital required to develop these licenses 
subscriber turnover 
our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in this year over year increase was mostly driven by churn results from the second half of we believe our subscriber churn rate has been and is likely to continue to be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased competition  an increase in non pay disconnects primarily resulting from adverse economic conditions  operational inefficiencies  continuing effects of customer commitment expirations  and increases in the theft of our signal or our competitors signals  as well as other forms of fraud 
competitor bundling of video services with way high speed internet access and telephone services may also contribute more significantly to churn over time 
additionally  certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers  and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate 
however  these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to lower our subscriber churn rate  or that our subscriber churn rates will not increase 
we believe we can reduce churn by improving customer service and other areas of our operations 
however  given the increasing demand for advanced products such as dvrs and hd  it may not be possible to reduce churn without significantly increasing our spending on customer retention  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and free cash flow 
additionally  as the size of our subscriber base increases  even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines  increasing numbers of gross new dish network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth 
at t and other telecommunications providers offer dish network programming bundled with broadband  telephony and other services 
our net new subscriber additions and certain of our other key operating metrics could be adversely affected if at t or other telecommunication providers de emphasize or discontinue selling our services and we are not able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels 
increases in theft of our signal  or our competitors signals  could in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards  called smart cards  or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content 
however  our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service  and even though we continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult  theft of our signal is increasing 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our service 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during  we replaced our smart cards in order to reduce theft of our service 
however  the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system  and we have since implemented software patches and other security measures to help protect our service 
nevertheless  these security measures are short term fixes and we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
therefore  we have developed a plan to replace our existing smart cards and or security chips to re secure our signals for a longer term which will commence later this year and is expected to take approximately nine to twelve months to complete 
while our existing smart cards installed in remain under warranty  we could incur operational costs in excess of million in connection with our smart card replacement program 
we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  including eliminating certain payment options for subscribers  such as the use of pre paid debit cards  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
subscriber acquisition and retention costs 
our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income loss and free cash flow between periods 
our subscriber acquisition costs  sac and subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition  or for other reasons 
capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been  and we expect will continue to be  partially mitigated by  among other things  the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers 
however  to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes  and the associated costs may be substantial 
to the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete  we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the sac reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment 
several years ago  we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting psk modulation technology 
since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers  our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment 
as we continue to implement psk technology  bandwidth efficiency will improve  significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites 
new channels we add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities 
we have also implemented mpeg technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our hd programming packages and are converting all existing hd satellite receivers to the same technology 
this technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time 
we have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the dish network dbs system to these new technologies  or the period of time over which the conversions will occur 
provided that echostar x continues to operate normally and other planned satellites are successfully deployed  this increased satellite capacity and our psk transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to mpeg while we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions  the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment  at least in the short term 
our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers 
these increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies 
in an effort to reduce subscriber turnover  we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment 
we generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs 
as discussed above  we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes 
as a consequence  our retention costs  which are included in subscriber related expenses  and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers  will increase  at least in the short term  to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements 
our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers  if we introduce other more aggressive promotions  if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for hd receivers or receivers with other enhanced technologies  or for other reasons 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available 
we may  however  decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  if needed in the future

our initial ten year term lease for at least capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites

the commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under capital lease obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under satellite related obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under interest on long term debt in the table above 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  and for products and services related to the operation of our dish network 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the table above 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base 
programming expenses are included in subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
satellite insurance 
we currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own 
we do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure 
we believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover  in a relatively short time frame  transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails 
we could not  however  recover certain local markets  international and other niche programming 
further  programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses 
future capital requirements 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to retain existing dish network subscribers 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support possible strategic initiatives including our plans to expand our national and local hd offering 
our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of  among other things  increased competition for subscription television customers  significant satellite failures  or general economic downturn 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
there can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms 
from time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products  enhance our technical capabilities  improve or sustain our competitive position  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video  data and voice services 
future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital  assume third party debt or other long term obligations 
also  the plan to repurchase our class a common stock extends through december   which could require that we raise additional capital 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is billion 
there can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued current dislocations in the credit markets  which have significantly impacted the availability and pricing of financing  particularly in the high yield debt and leveraged credit markets  may significantly constrain our ability to obtain financing to support our growth initiatives 
these developments in the credit markets may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position and may  as a result  cause us to defer or abandon profitable business strategies that we would otherwise pursue if financing were available on acceptable terms 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are ba and bb on our long term senior notes as rated by moody s investor service moody s and standard and poor s s p rating service  respectively 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
with respect to moody s  the ba rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk 
for s p s  the bb rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues 
however  the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections 
inventory reserve 
management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience  the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  among other things  estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow the guidelines set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
in accordance with sfas  we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revised business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position and results of operations 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
we are required to adopt this statement as of january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we are required to adopt this statement as of january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
seasonality our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the subscription television service industry  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
we do not have any material backlog of our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments as of december   our restricted and unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  c commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and d instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
in connection with the spin off  we contributed billion of our cash and cash equivalents to echostar on january  our restricted and unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended december  of 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
the value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by  among other things  the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets  as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold 
however  the high quality of these investments as assessed by independent rating agencies reduces these risks 
the value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of the billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts 
while an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
consequently  neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes 
as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments are highly speculative and are concentrated in a small number of companies 
during the same period  our strategic investments experienced volatility  which is likely to continue 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio 
the fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments 
we currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale 
we adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within total stockholders equity deficit  net of related deferred income tax 
declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment 
we evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary 
this quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing  among other things  the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount  the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security 
generally  absent specific factors to the contrary  declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary 
declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings  absent specific factors to the contrary 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued as of december   we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of million as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within total stockholders equity deficit 
during the year ended december   we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities of million 
during the year ended december   our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
if the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired  we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value 
we also have several strategic investments in certain equity securities which are included in other noncurrent assets  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
our other investment securities consist of the following as of december  other investment securities in thousands cost method equity method fair value method total generally  we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting 
because these equity securities are generally not publicly traded  it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments  however  these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing  among other things  company business plans and current financial statements  if available  for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment 
such factors may include  but are not limited to  cash flow concerns  material litigation  violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy 
the fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
we also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock  public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company 
the debt which is convertible into the issuer s publicly traded common shares is accounted for under the fair value method with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the black scholes option pricing model including the fair market value of the underlying common stock price as of that date 
during  we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer 
consequently  we account for the common share component of this investment under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of our change to equity method accounting  we evaluate the common share component of this investment on a quarterly basis to determine whether there has been a decline in the value that is other than temporary 
because the shares are publicly traded  this quarterly evaluation considers the fair market value of the common shares in addition to the other factors described above for equity and cost method investments 

table of contents item a 
uantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued during the year ended december   we recognized unrealized net losses on our other investment security of million accounted for under the fair value method of accounting 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recorded aggregate charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain of our other investment securities of million  and established a new cost basis for these securities 
any cumulative translation adjustment associated with these investments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within total stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets until the investments are sold or otherwise liquidated  at which time  they will be released into our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
as of december   we had fixed rate debt  mortgages and other notes payable of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt  and an analysis based on certain assumptions discussed below for our private debt 
in completing our analysis for our private debt  we evaluate market conditions  related securities  various public and private offerings  and other publicly available information 
in performing this analysis  we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads  volatility  and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
