operations we own and operate integrated resorts in las vegas and macao  and have current on going development projects in macao on the cotai strip  and in singapore and pennsylvania

approximately of gross revenue at the venetian  the sands expo center and the congress center for the year ended december   was derived from hotel rooms  food and beverage  and other non gaming sources and was derived from gaming 
the percentage of non gaming revenue for the venetian reflects the integrated resort s emphasis on the group convention and trade show business and the resulting higher occupancy and room rates during mid week periods

key operating revenue measurements operating revenues at our las vegas properties and the venetian macao are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel  which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and the volume of table games and slot machine play 
hotel revenues are not material for the sands macao as its revenues are principally driven by casino customers that visit the casino on a daily basis 
visitors to our macao properties arrive by ferry  automobile  bus  airplane or helicopter from hong kong  cities in china  and other southeast asian cities in close proximity to macao and elsewhere 
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenue casino revenue measurements for las vegas table games drop and slot handle are volume measurements 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of drop or handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
table games drop represents the sum of markers issued credit instruments less markers paid at the table  plus cash deposited in the table drop box 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coin placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
drop and handle are abbreviations for table games drop and slot handle 
based upon our mix of table games  our table games produce a statistical average win percentage calculated before 
table of contents discounts as measured as a percentage of table game drop of to and slot machines produce a statistical average win percentage calculated before slot club cash incentives as measured as a percentage of slot machine handle generally between and 
casino revenue measurements for macao macao table games are segregated into two groups  consistent with the macao market s convention rolling chip play all vip play and non rolling chip play mostly non vip players 
the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non negotiable gaming chips wagered 
the volume measurement for non rolling chip play is table games drop as described above 
rolling chip volume and non rolling chip volume are not equivalent as rolling chip volume is a measure of amounts wagered versus dropped 
rolling chip volume is substantially higher than table games drop 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coins placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
we view rolling chip table games win as a percentage of rolling chip volume and non rolling chip table games win as a percentage of drop 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume  non rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
based upon our mix of table games in macao  our rolling chip table games win percentage calculated before discounts and commissions as measured as a percentage of rolling chip volume is expected to be and our non rolling chip table games are expected to produce a statistical average win percentage as measured as a percentage of table game drop of to 
similar to las vegas  our macao slot machines produce a statistical average win percentage as measured as a percentage of slot machine handle of generally between and 
actual win may vary from the statistical average 
generally  slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis 
credit based wagering for our las vegas properties was approximately of table games revenues for the year ended december  table games play at our macao properties are conducted primarily on a cash basis with only credit based wagering for the year ended december  hotel revenue measurements hotel occupancy rate  which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  and average daily room rate  which is the average price of occupied rooms per day  are used as performance indicators 
revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy 
because not all available rooms are occupied  average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room 
reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re sold to walk in guests 
these rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk in guest revenue 
in cases where a significant number of rooms are resold  occupancy rates may be in excess of and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december   was 
the effective tax rate for the year was significantly lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to a zero effective tax rate on our macao net income as a result of an income tax exemption in macao on gaming operations  which is set to expire at the end of based on macanese law and the treatment of other gaming operators  we believe the income tax exemption will be extended for an additional five year term 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   primarily due to the application of the aforementioned macao income tax exemption 
the effective income tax rate for was higher than the period due to no tax benefit being recorded on certain losses in some foreign jurisdictions and our geographic income mix

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million as compared with cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the main factor contributing to the increase is the payments of leasehold interests in land

capital and liquidity as previously described  we have a number of significant development projects underway in the united states  macao and singapore for which we expect construction to continue through in the united states  the estimated costs to build the las vegas condominium tower and the sands bethworks project are each approximately million  of which we have capitalized approximately million and million  respectively 
in macao  the estimated cost to build our developments on the cotai strip including the venetian macao is approximately billion  of which we have capitalized approximately billion 
in singapore  although construction has started on the marina bay sands  we are continuing to work with the singapore government to finalize various design aspects of the integrated resort and are in the process of finalizing our cost estimates for the project 
we expect that the cost to design  develop and construct the marina bay sands will be in excess of billion inclusive of payments made in for the land premium  taxes and other fees of which we have incurred approximately billion 
we have principally funded our global development projects through borrowings under the bank credit facilities of our operating subsidiaries  operating cash flows and proceeds from the disposition of non core assets 
in  we began to execute our financing strategy to secure additional borrowing capacity to fund our existing and future development projects and operations in asia  including macao and singapore  and the united states 
in april  we increased the size of our macao credit facility to fund our macao development projects from billion to billion by exercising our right to access an additional million of incremental facilities under the accordion feature provided under the macao credit facility 
the incremental million consisted of an additional million of term loans and an increase of million to the revolving credit facility to million 
in connection with the increase in the macao credit facility  the lenders also approved a reduction of the interest rate margin for all classes of loans by basis points  thereby reducing our overall interest expense under the macao credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility portion of the macao credit facility 
we are currently in the preliminary stages of exploring our options with respect to refinancing our macao credit facility  the proceeds of which would be used to refinance the amount currently outstanding under the macao credit facility as well as provide incremental borrowings to continue to fund our development projects on the cotai strip in macao 
in may  we initiated our us refinancing efforts by entering into a billion senior secured credit facility 
a portion of the proceeds of this facility was used to refinance the indebtedness collateralized by our las vegas integrated resort  including the venetian  the palazzo  the shoppes at the palazzo and the sands expo center  and to fund design  development and construction costs incurred in the connection with the completion of the palazzo  which partially opened on december   the shoppes at the palazzo and the las vegas condominiums 
we completed our us refinancing efforts by entering into a million amended and restated 
table of contents ff e credit facility in august  the proceeds of which are being used to finance or refinance the acquisition of furniture  fixtures and equipment located in the venetian and the palazzo 
as of december   we had approximately billion and million of available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility and the amended and restated ff e credit facility  respectively 
the senior secured credit facility permits us to make investments in our foreign subsidiaries and our other development projects outside of las vegas in an amount not to exceed billion  and permits us to invest in our sands bethworks project so long as no more than of any such investment is in the form of equity 
as of december   we have used approximately million of the permitted billion to fund a portion of our required equity contribution to the marina bay sands project and investments with respect to our other asian development projects  including in macao 
in december  we entered into a sgd billion credit facility approximately billion at exchange rates in effect at december  to fund construction costs and expenses at the marina bay sands  which closed and funded in january a portion of the proceeds of this facility  together with a portion of our initial sgd million approximately million at exchange rates in effect at december  equity contribution  were used to repay outstanding borrowings of approximately sgd billion approximately billion at exchange rates in effect at december  on the existing singapore bridge facility 
the remaining funds available for borrowing under the singapore credit facility will be used to fund a significant portion of the design  development and construction costs of the marina bay sands project 
under the terms of the singapore credit facility  we are obligated to fund at least of the total costs and expenses incurred in connection with the design  development and construction of the marina bay sands project with equity contributions or subordinated intercompany loans  with the remaining funded with debt  including debt under the singapore credit facility 
we have funded our current equity contribution requirement through borrowings under our us senior secured credit facility 
due to these substantial development activities  included in current liabilities were construction payables of approximately million as of december  as a portion of the current liabilities will be funded out of our long term borrowing capacity  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million as of december  subsequent to year end  we borrowed approximately million on our credit facilities  of which approximately million was used to pay construction payables outstanding as of december  we held unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  we believe that our existing cash balances  operating cash flows from the venetian and the palazzo and the proceeds from the anticipated sale of the shoppes at the palazzo to ggp and our las vegas condominium units  together with our available borrowing capacity under the us senior secured credit facility and the ff e credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the estimated development and construction costs for the las vegas condominiums and the sands bethworks projects during in addition  we believe that these funds will also enable us to fund our equity contribution requirement for the marina bay sands project and provide additional capital to our macao subsidiaries to fund a portion of our development projects on the cotai strip in macao during this same time period 
existing restricted and unrestricted cash balances at our macao subsidiaries  operating cash flows from the sands macao and the venetian macao and available borrowing capacity under the macao credit facility  together with funds made available under our us senior secured credit facility  will be used to fund current development and construction costs for the cotai strip development activities in the short term 
however  we will need to arrange additional debt and or equity financing in the near term to continue to fund our design  development and construction activities at the remaining cotai strip development projects 
we expect to complete this refinancing in in the near term  we will continue to borrow significant amounts under our existing and future bank credit facilities as we fund our global construction and development projects 
in connection with such borrowing needs  we regularly evaluate conditions in the global credit markets
