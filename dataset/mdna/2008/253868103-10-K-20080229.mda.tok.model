overview our company 
we completed our initial public offering of common stock ipo on november  we believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify  and have elected to be treated  as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
our company was formed on march  during the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our ipo we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the company 
any reference to our  we and us in this filing includes our company and our predecessor 
our predecessor is comprised of the real estate activities and holdings of global innovation partners llc  or gi partners  which gi partners contributed to us in connection with our ipo 
business and strategy 
our primary business objectives are to maximize sustainable long term growth in earnings  funds from operations and cash flow per share and to maximize returns to our stockholders 
we expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and redeveloping technology related real estate 
a significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for redevelopment and new properties 
we target high quality  strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day to day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants and properties that may be redeveloped for such use 
most of our properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems  multiple power feeds  above standard precision cooling systems  raised floor areas  extensive in building communications cabling and high level security systems 
we focus solely on technology related real estate because we believe that the growth in corporate datacenter adoption and the technology related real estate industry generally will be superior to that of the overall economy 
as of december   we own an aggregate of technology related real estate properties  excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture  with million rentable square feet including approximately million square feet of space held for redevelopment 
at december   approximately  square feet of our space held for redevelopment was under construction for turn key datacenter  build to suit datacenter and powered base building space in us and european markets 
we have developed detailed  standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions to ensure that they meet our financial  technical and other criteria 
we expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a key part of our growth strategy 
we intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow 
we will continue to build out our redevelopment portfolio when justified by anticipated returns 
we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or new indebtedness may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties 
debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock and our preferred stock 
we currently intend to limit our indebtedness to of our total market capitalization and  based on the closing price of our common stock on december  of  our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately as of december  our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market 
table of contents value of our outstanding common stock which may decrease  thereby increasing our debt to total market capitalization ratio  excluding options issued under our incentive award plan  plus the liquidation value of our preferred stock  plus the aggregate value of the units not held by us with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of our common stock and excluding long term incentive units and class c units  plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness 
in addition  we may sell properties from time to time that no longer meet our business objectives 
in june  east tufts avenue met the criteria to be presented as held for sale  which resulted in the reclassification of the operating results of this property to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
this property was sold on july  in addition  we sold technology center drive and valley view lane on march  and march   respectively and the results of operations for these properties have also been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
revenue base 
as of december   we owned properties through our operating partnership  excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture 
these properties are mainly located throughout the us  with properties located in europe and one property in canada 
we acquired our first portfolio property in january and have added properties as follows year ended december properties acquired net rentable square feet acquired square feet of space held for redevelopment as of december  properties owned as of december  excludes properties sold in and technology center drive march  valley view lane march and east tufts avenue july 
also excludes a leasehold interest acquired in march related to an acquisition made in excludes space held for redevelopment 
redevelopment space is unoccupied space that requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use 
most often this is shell space 
however  in certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space 
the amounts included in this table represent redevelopment space as of december  in the properties acquired during the relevant period 
as of december   the properties in our portfolio were approximately leased excluding million square feet held for redevelopment 
due to the capital intensive and long term nature of the operations being supported  our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases 
as of december   our original average lease term was approximately years  with an average of eight years remaining 
leasing since the completion of our initial public offering in november has been at lease terms shorter than years 
our lease expirations through december  are of net rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of december  operating revenues from properties outside the united states were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses generally consist of utilities  property and ad valorem taxes  property management fees  insurance and site operating and maintenance costs  as well as rental expenses 
since the consummation of our ipo  our asset management function has been internalized and we currently incur our 
table of contents general and administrative expenses directly 
prior to april  we had a transition services agreement with cb richard ellis investors with respect to transitional accounting and other services 
in addition  as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance  us securities and exchange commission reporting and compliance with the various provisions of sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we engage third party property managers to manage most of our properties 
factors which may influence future results of operations rental income 
the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations 
excluding million square feet held for redevelopment  as of december   the occupancy rate in the properties in our portfolio was approximately of our net rentable square feet 
the amount of rental income generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
included in our approximately million square feet of net rentable square feet  excluding redevelopment space  at december  is approximately  net rentable square feet of space with extensive datacenter improvements that is currently  or will shortly be  available for lease 
since our ipo  we have leased approximately  square feet of similar space 
these turn key datacenters are effective solutions for tenants who lack the expertise or capital budget to provide their own extensive datacenter infrastructure and security 
as experts in datacenter construction and operations we are able to lease space to these tenants at a significant premium over other uses 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million square feet of redevelopment space  or approximately of the total space in our portfolio  including eight vacant properties comprising approximately  square feet 
redevelopment space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use  and in addition  we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for redevelopment space 
we will require additional capital to finance our redevelopment activities  which may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to redevelop space and lease redevelopment space at favorable rates  which we may not be able to obtain 
we intend to purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant redevelopment space in the future 
economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in the technology related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re lease space  otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
as of december   we had no material tenants in bankruptcy 
scheduled lease expirations 
our ability to re lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations 
in addition to approximately million square feet of available space in our portfolio  which excludes approximately million square feet available for redevelopment as of december   leases representing approximately and of the square footage of our portfolio  excluding redevelopment space  are scheduled to expire during the periods ending december  and  respectively 

table of contents market concentration 
we depend on the market for technology based real estate in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional markets can impact our future results 
as of december  our portfolio was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets metropolitan market percentage of total annualized rent silicon valley chicago new york dallas phoenix san francisco los angeles other annualized rent is monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of december  multiplied by operating expenses 
our operating expenses generally consist of utilities  property taxes  property management fees  insurance and site maintenance costs  as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases 
we also incur general and administrative expenses  including expenses relating to our asset management function  as well as significant legal  accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance  us securities and exchange commission reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance 
we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we expand 
interest rates and liquidity 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt  of which approximately million was mortgage debt subject to interest rate swap agreements  and million was outstanding on our line of credit facility 
since  with the exception of recent rate cuts  the united states federal reserve has been increasing short term interest rates  which has had a significant upward impact on shorter term interest rates  including the interest rates that our variable rate debt is based upon 
furthermore  difficulties with sub prime residential housing credit have impacted corporate debt 
liquidity traditionally provided by collateralized debt obligations has significantly decreased 
the affects on commercial real estate mortgages include higher loan spreads  tightened loan covenants and reduced loan to value ratios and resulting borrower proceeds 
potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations  and reduce our access to capital markets 
increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations  which would further increase our interest expense 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash dividends to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial 
table of contents condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report 
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the property and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases  any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our allocation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for example  if we were to allocate more value to land  there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time 
this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of the value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
asset impairment evaluation 
we review the carrying value of our properties when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate potential impairment may exist 
we base our review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
we estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 

table of contents capitalization of costs 
we capitalize pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs related to construction  development and redevelopment  including property taxes  insurance  financing and employee costs relating to space under development 
costs previously capitalized related to any property acquisitions no longer considered probable are written off  which may have a material effect on our net income 
the selection of costs to capitalize and which acquisitions are probable is subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
if we made different assumptions in this respect we would have a different amount of capitalized costs in the periods presented leading to different net income 
revenue recognition rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in our balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that would be received under the remaining terms of the leases 
many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
however  we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses and real estate taxes under our leases for turn key datacenters 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease  effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized  assuming collection is not considered doubtful 
as discussed above  we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
share based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share based awards 
we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
the calculation of the fair value of share based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility  dividend payments and future company results 
these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period

restricted cash primarily consists of interest bearing cash deposits required by the terms of several of our mortgage loans for a variety of purposes  including real estate taxes  insurance  anticipated or contractually obligated tenant improvements and leasing deposits 
our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses  redevelopment costs and other expenditures associated with our properties  dividend payments on our preferred stock  dividend payments to our stockholders and distributions to our unitholders in the operating partnership required to maintain our reit status  capital expenditures  debt service on our loans and  potentially  acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations  restricted cash accounts established for certain future payments and by drawing upon our revolving credit facility 
on august   we modified our revolving credit facility  pursuant to which the total capacity of the revolving credit facility was expanded from million to million and now matures in august  subject to two one year extension options exercisable by us 
as of december   borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at a blended rate of us dollar  euro and british pound sterling  which is based on month libor  month euribor and month gbp libor  respectively  plus a margin of 
the margin can range from to  depending on our operating partnership s total overall leverage 
the revolving credit facility has a million sub facility for multicurrency advances in british pound sterling  canadian dollars  euros  and swiss francs 
on february   we executed an amendment to the revolving credit facility  which increased the limit on the multi currency sub facility from million to million 
we intend to use available borrowings under the revolving credit facility to  among other things  finance the acquisition of additional properties  to fund tenant improvements and capital expenditures  fund 
table of contents development and redevelopment activities and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes 
as of december   approximately million was drawn under this facility  and million of letters of credit were issued  leaving million available for use 
on february   we issued million shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses  of million  including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to temporarily repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  to acquire properties  to fund development and redevelopment activities and for general corporate purposes 
future uses of cash our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
as of december   we have identified from our existing properties approximately million square feet of redevelopment space and we also owned approximately  net rentable square feet of datacenter space with extensive installed tenant improvements that we may subdivide for turn key datacenter use during the next two years rather than lease such space to large single tenants 
turn key datacenter space is move in ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment required to provide a datacenter environment 
depending on demand for additional turn key datacenter space  we expect to incur significant tenant improvement costs to build out and redevelop these spaces
