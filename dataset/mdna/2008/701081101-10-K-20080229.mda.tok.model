item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook summary our business continues to benefit from the favorable market conditions resulting primarily from high commodity prices and worldwide demand 
the price of oil has remained at world record levels for the past few years and shows few signs of retreating  unless there is an unanticipated and precipitous reduction in demand  for example  due to a recession affecting multiple countries currently fueling the demand 
natural gas prices have continued to fluctuate and are more susceptible to factors that affect temporal demand  such as weather 
as a contract driller and provider of rental tools  our financial results are largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas exploration and drilling of major  large independent and national oil companies around the world 
due to the sustained high oil prices most operators have increased their budgets and are actively seeking to increase their reserves to meet worldwide demand for oil  primarily in international locations 
as part of our strategic initiatives  we strive to deploy our international land rigs to those areas and for those operators that we anticipate will generate long term profits 
we have upgraded our domestic barge fleet during the past few years to enhance our ability to provide the safest and lowest total well cost drilling service to operators drilling for natural gas in the gulf of mexico transition zones 
we believe our preferred fleet will continue to generate solid financial results despite moderate softening in natural gas demand 
overview total operating income increased percent over primarily as a result of continued strong performance from our us gulf of mexico operations and rental tools business 
demand in the us for both barge rig and rental tools was consistently high in international operations grew in the second half of the year as we transitioned to new contracts  with revenues in the last six months of the year million percent higher than in the first half 
drilling and rental operating income was up percent million  with overall drilling operations utilization at percent  up from percent in utilization in the us gulf of mexico market was percent compared to percent in  with deep drilling barge utilization at percent 
quail operating profit was also up million over on a revenue increase of million 
we also benefited from the sale of two workover barges  resulting in a gain of million 
in international markets  utilization increased to percent by the end of the year as we commenced operation on substantially all of our new land drilling contracts 
at the end of  we had five rigs drilling in mexico  another rigging up and another moving to location  both of which commenced operation in the first quarter of two rigs in colombia worked most of after commencing operations in the fourth quarter of in the cis region  seven of nine rigs were working by the end of the year 
six of these rigs had completed long term contracts in in our africa middle east region  start up of new country operations was slow and difficult 
in libya  we experienced costly shortages of equipment and other start up issues which delayed commencement 
our customer terminated our three year contract in early january after completion of the first well 
in algeria  we experienced delays in getting the newly constructed rigs into the country and rigged up and incurred significant downtime during the first few months of operations  although both rigs operated throughout the fourth quarter with minimal downtime 

table of contents overview and outlook continued our percent owned saudi arabia joint venture has experienced significant cost overruns due to increases in vendor prices  costs to remedy defects in construction and delays in equipment delivery 
although the joint venture has expended significant non budgeted costs to commission rigs one through four  the rigs were late in starting drilling operations 
the joint venture customer  saudi aramco  initially suspended liquidated damages for six months  but began deducting them from the november and december invoices through a percent reduction of dayrates 
at the request of the joint venture  saudi aramco subsequently agreed to suspend further deductions pending a resolution of this issue 
in the fourth quarter of we accrued million our percent portion of liquidated damages 
we also recorded million in operating losses during the period  and provided a million reserve for advances related to the joint venture 
on december   pkd kazakhstan paid the tax portion of the income tax assessment which is described further in note to the financial statements 
the payment was partially funded by drawing million from our revolving credit agreement 
outlook we anticipate a continuation of favorable market conditions in as a result  we expect strong results in from our international operations as we realize full year benefits of contracts at higher dayrates commencing throughout in mexico  kazakhstan and turkmenistan 
in addition  rig in mexico spud in early february and rig  which has been upgraded  is mobilizing for a contract in kazakhstan and is expected to spud in march rig  a new build  is expected to begin mobilization in march and should commence operations in kazakhstan mid the contract for our barge rig in the caspian sea is up for renewal in april  and we expect to reach an agreement with our customer for a substantial increase in the dayrate 
us operations are also projected to continue to provide strong results in although we expect some softening in utilization and dayrates 
we anticipate our rental tools segment will experience further growth attributable to full year results of additional capital invested throughout in addition  we will continue our bp liberty feed project for bp alaska through the first quarter of  and await the award of the full project which has been presented to its board for sanctioning in april when completed  this rig will be capable of drilling extended reach wells of approximately  feet 
we anticipate continued high operating costs over the next few months for the four rigs currently operating in our saudi arabia joint venture due primarily to continued rental of certain components until they are replaced with permanent capital equipment  which is anticipated to be completed by the end of the second quarter the joint venture also continues to incur significant capital costs associated with the commissioning of the remaining two rigs and is in discussions with saudi aramco to resolve the cost issues associated with the project 
recent events on february   the kazakhstan branch of parker drilling company international limited  a subsidiary of parker drilling  received notice that the atyrau economic court issued a ruling canceling the interest assessment of approximately us million issued by the ministry of finance of the republic of kazakhstan  which was calculated from the date the revenue was received in  and has ruled that the interest should be recalculated from and after october  the date of the assessment  through december   the date the principal tax was paid 
although this would reduce interest to approximately million  we have not adjusted our reserve  pending final resolution

the gross margin amounts  excluding depreciation and amortization  and gross margin percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including drilling and rental gross margin 
management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more accurately reflects cash generated by segment

table of contents results of operations continued us drilling segment revenues for the us drilling segment increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increased revenues were primarily due to a million increase for deep drilling barges  as a result of a full year of operations for ultra deep barge rig  percent fleet utilization in versus percent in and a percent increase in dayrates 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenues for intermediate and workover barges due primarily to the sale of workover barge rigs and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
barge rig was undergoing an upgrade from workover to deep drilling status until late may and newly constructed barge rig began operations in december during we also had two repositioned international land rigs operating in the us market which contributed million to the increase in us drilling segment revenues and we had an additional million related to engineering services contracts 
average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day in as compared to as a result of higher dayrates and additional revenue days on the deep drilling barge rigs  the addition of two land rigs  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million 
this increase includes a million increase for the engineering services contracts referred to above  partially offset by a million decrease for the two land rigs as a result of expenses incurred in moving the rigs out of the us after completion of wells in early international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million during the year ended december  of this increase  million is related to an increase in international land drilling revenues  offset by a million decrease in revenues from offshore operations 
the decline of million in offshore operations is due primarily to the sale of our barge rigs in nigeria in the third quarter of in our americas region  land drilling revenues in mexico increased million to million due to higher dayrates under the new contracts entered into in and higher utilization 
in colombia  revenues were million higher in than in  as rig commenced operation on december  and rig was mobilizing at the end of  whereas both rigs operated most of land revenues in the cis decreased by million as a result of completion of the two rig  tco contract in million  the release of our three rigs in turkmenistan million during the third quarter of  and a reduction in revenues related to our sakhalin island operations million primarily related to lower reimbursable revenues and the completion of a water reinjection well project in july 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan  where rig operated all year in the rig was released in late december from the tco contract and commenced operations at the end of march and the addition of rigs and from the tco contract  both of which began drilling in the third quarter of  and increases related to the full year operation of rig  which began drilling in western kazakhstan in late million 
in our asia pacific region  revenues decreased million due mainly to completion of contracts in bangladesh for rig million and for two of our rigs in new zealand million 

table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  for international land operations increased by million 
in mexico  gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  improved by million due to higher dayrates under new contracts and to lower expenses in  as included costs to close down operations and relocate seven rigs outside mexico 
in colombia  gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million as two rigs drilled most of  compared to virtually no rigs operating in colombia in the comparable period of in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan  gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million as two rigs operated all of the period of  compared to one rig in the comparable period of and also as a result of pre mobilization standby and operating revenues for rigs and that moved into the field in rig  also operating in kazakhstan  contributed an increase of million for the period of  as this rig was not working in the region in the comparable period in the increases were partially offset by million in losses incurred in our africa middle east region as our libya operations incurred a million loss mainly due to start up costs being written off as a result of an abrupt contract termination by our customer after completion of one well and in algeria where excessive downtime and delayed start ups contributed to a loss of million for the year 
other gross margin decreases related to the completion of contract wells under our tco contract  the release of rigs in turkmenistan  and relocation of rig and to us operations  all of which occurred in international offshore revenues declined million to million during the year ended compared to this decrease was due primarily to the sale of our nigerian barge rigs in the third quarter of revenues for barge rig in mexico increased million due to a higher dayrate 
gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  for international offshore operations increased million as a result of the higher dayrate in mexico combined with lower costs in the caspian sea  partially offset by the sale of the nigeria barge rigs 
rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the increase was due primarily to an increase in rental revenues of million from our texarkana operations net of reductions at our odessa facility for customers formerly served by that location  million from international rentals  million from our evanston  wyoming operations and million from our new iberia location  partially offset by a decline of million from our victoria  texas operation 
revenues increased primarily due to higher demand and higher rental tool sales 
rental tools gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million for the current period as compared to gross margin percentage  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased to percent in the current period as compared to percent in other financial data gain on asset dispositions increased by million  due primarily to the gain on the sale of the two workover barge rigs in the first quarter of interest expense declined million during the year ended december  as compared to due to lower average rates on our outstanding debt and capitalization of million in interest on rig construction projects in there was million of capitalized interest for the year ended december  interest income decreased million when compared to due to lower levels of cash available for investment 
our equity loss related to our percent owned joint venture in saudi arabia was million  consisting of million in accrued liquidated damages  a operating loss and a million reserve for advances to the joint venture 
general and administration expense decreased million as compared to the year ended as a result of a change  in going forward in our method of estimating the amount of corporate shared services costs allocable to operations 
the current method is based on a third party study of actual shared service time spent on each operation  whereas the previous method was less precise and based on each operation s portion of total revenues 

table of contents results of operations continued other financial data continued in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we reported the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions and for the year ended december   we recognized a minimal change in the fair value of the derivative positions

table of contents results of operations continued us drilling segment revenues for the us drilling segment increased million to million as compared to the year ended december  the increased revenues were primarily due to a million increase for our barge drilling operations where we had higher dayrates  that more than offset lower utilization 
barge rig was undergoing an upgrade from workover to deep drilling status until late may and we also had maintenance and upgrade time for barge rigs  and newly constructed barge rig also began operations in december during the last half of we also repositioned two international land rigs into the us market which contributed million to the increase in us drilling segment revenues 
as of december  this segment consisted of barge rigs ten deep drilling barge rigs  four intermediate drilling barge rigs and five workover barge rigs  and two land rigs 
two of the workover barge rigs were reflected as assets held for sale as of december  and were sold in early january see note average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day in as compared to as a result of approximately percent higher dayrates on all barge rigs  the addition of two land rigs and effective operating cost controls  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization increased million to million

international drilling segment international drilling revenues decreased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the completion of long term contracts and the transition to new contracts throughout the year 
international land drilling revenues decreased million and offshore operations declined million 
the international land drilling revenues decrease was attributable primarily to completion of contracts in mexico million  kazakhstan tco contract million  and the partial completion of our contracts in turkmenistan million  resulting in the release of two of three rigs  and new zealand million due to downtime for rig in the second quarter of the sale in of rigs in colombia and peru also caused a decline of million in revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by increases from new international land contracts  a portion of which are attributable to release of above mentioned rigs that were re located to other operating areas

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by sfas no

we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 

table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically assess whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill is impaired based generally on the estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation to which goodwill has been assigned is less than its carrying value  we deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in dayrate and utilization assumptions used in the fair value calculations could result in fair value estimates that are below carrying value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
we also test for impairment based on events or changes in circumstances that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill at each year end 
our annual impairment tests of goodwill for  and indicated that the fair value of operations to which goodwill relates exceeded the carrying values as of december   and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability claims and health benefits 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 

table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we provide for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
our accounting policy for income taxes is also affected by fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted january  this interpretation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately anticipate actual outcome 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
accounting for derivative instruments 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas established accounting and disclosure requirements for most derivative instruments and hedge transactions involving derivatives 
sfas also requires formal documentation procedures for hedging relationships and effectiveness testing when hedge accounting is to be applied 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on our senior floating rate notes 
the senior floating rate notes were redeemed in full on september  both swap agreements were terminated or expired prior to redemption 

table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued we did not use hedge accounting treatment for these interest rate swap agreements as we determined that the hedges would not be highly effective as defined by sfas the ineffectiveness of the hedges was caused by embedded written call options in the interest rate swap agreements that did not exist in the notes 
accordingly  we recognized the volatility of the swap agreements on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives 
for the year ended december   there was no significant change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives 
these non cash items are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as changes in fair value of derivative positions 
on july   we terminated one swap scheduled to expire in september and received million 
the second swap was not renewed and expired on september  for additional information see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we reported the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions and for the year ended december  we recognized a minimal change in the fair value of the derivative positions 
on july   we terminated one swap scheduled to expire in september and received million 
the second swap was not renewed and expired on september  long term debt the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of senior notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible senior notes due was million on december
