you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  results of operations and related information  adoption of new accounting pronouncements  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 
overview of business we are a leading international producer of premium fine papers and technical products 
we also produce bleached kraft pulp in canada  where we own approximately  acres of timberlands and have non exclusive rights to harvest wood from approximately  acres of other timberlands 
we have three primary operations our fine paper business  our technical products business and our pulp business 
in managing this diverse paper and pulp business  management believes that achieving and maintaining a leadership position for our fine paper and technical products businesses  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing currency  commodity and other risks are important to the long term success of the business 
the pulp cycle and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining leadership for our fine paper and technical products businesses have been an important part of our past performance 
our fine paper business has long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our technical products business is recognized as a leading supplier in the tape  filtration  component materials  graphics identification  and wall covering markets 
maintaining our leadership is important to our results  particularly in light of the competitive environment in which we operate 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets 
our paper business competes directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified in most of our markets 
in our pulp business  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  intense competition from suppliers of softwood pulps and southern hemisphere suppliers of hardwood pulps 
we expect our competitors to continue to be aggressive in the future 
cost control 
to improve and maintain our competitive position  we must control our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
a portion of our investments in capital improvements are intended to achieve cost savings and improvements in productivity 
cyclical nature of the pulp industry 
revenues in the pulp industry and our pulp business tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising market prices  leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced market prices and excess and idle capacity until the cycle is repeated 
general economic conditions 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by general economic conditions 
downturns and improvements in the us and european economies or in our export markets affect the demand for our products 
foreign currency and commodity risk 
sales of pulp by our pictou mill are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operation 
however  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because most of the costs relating to our pulp business are incurred in canadian dollars 
these risks could have a material impact on our results of operations if not effectively managed 
the following charts illustrate changes in currency and pulp prices that occurred during the periods covered by this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pulp price history average quarterly prices

our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for approximately percent of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin  and ripon  california are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers 
our technical products business is a leading producer of transportation and other filter media  durable  saturated and coated base papers for a variety of end uses and nonwoven wall coverings 
we sell our technical products globally via five sbus in product categories  and we focus on major categories where we believe we are a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  label  abrasive  transportation and other filter media  nonwoven wall coverings  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used for customer specific applications in furniture  book covers and original equipment manufacturers products 
our customers are located in more than countries 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in munising  michigan and near munich and frankfurt  germany 
our pulp business consists of a mill located in pictou  nova scotia together with related timberlands the pictou mill 
the pictou mill is comprised of a single line pulp facility which produces primarily softwood pulp  as well as timberlands encompassing approximately  acres of owned and  acres of licensed or managed land in nova scotia 
in  the pictou mill produced approximately  metric tons of bleached kraft pulp 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations for the years ended december   and executive summary during  we completed several complementary strategic initiatives we sold  acres of woodlands in nova scotia  we divested our terrace bay pulp operations and we acquired the german technical and specialty paper business of fibermark  inc fibermark 
during the first quarter of  our strategic initiatives continued with the purchase of fox river as defined below to add scale  well known brands and integration benefits as we combine fox river with our existing fine paper business 
these strategic initiatives substantially changed the composition of our business and reduced our exposure to the cyclical pulp market 
for the year ended december   our paper businesses fine paper and technical products represented more than percent of our consolidated net sales 
this compares to our paper businesses representing approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for the first quarter of  prior to the transfer of the terrace bay pulp operations 
in february  we committed to a plan to sell the pictou mill and our remaining woodland assets in nova scotia 
we believe it is probable that a sale of the pictou mill and the woodland assets will be completed within months 
following is a more detailed discussion of the completed strategic activities sale of woodlands in june  our wholly owned subsidiary  neenah paper company of canada neenah canada sold approximately  acres of woodlands in nova scotia to atlantic star forestry ltd and nova star forestry ltd collectively  the purchaser for net cash proceeds of million 
neenah canada also entered into a fiber supply agreement the fsa with the purchaser to secure a source of fiber for the pictou mill 
following the sale  neenah canada has approximately  acres of owned and  acres of licensed or managed woodlands in nova scotia 
pursuant to the terms of the fsa  the purchaser is required to make available to the pictou mill sufficient woodlands acreage to yield  metric tons of softwood timber annually 
the fsa expires in december and neenah canada has the option to unilaterally extend the fsa for an additional five years 
also  the fsa can be extended for an additional five years upon the mutual agreement of neenah canada and the purchaser 
the sale qualified for gain recognition under the full accrual method described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas 
as a result  neenah canada recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately million and deferred approximately million  which represents neenah canada s estimated maximum exposure to loss under the fsa 
divestiture of terrace bay we suspended manufacturing at our terrace bay  ontario pulp operation in february when the mill s fiber supply was exhausted as a result of a strike initiated in january by workers employed by the woodlands operations that supplied wood fiber to the mill 
in august  neenah canada transferred the terrace bay  ontario pulp mill and related woodlands operations terrace bay to certain affiliates of buchanan forest products ltd 
buchanan 
buchanan acquired substantially all of the assets of terrace bay and assumed responsibility for substantially all of the liabilities related to its future operation in exchange for a cash payment of million 
at closing  in addition to certain working capital amounts  neenah canada retained pension and long term disability obligations for current and former mill employees and post employment medical and life insurance obligations for current retirees 
in december  neenah canada settled its pension obligations under the ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan the ontario plan and terminated the plan 
upon termination of the ontario plan  neenah canada recognized a non cash pre tax settlement loss of million 
see executive summary results of discontinued operations 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  neenah canada reached an agreement to settle a proposed class action lawsuit alleging the wrongful reduction and or elimination of certain retiree benefits following the transfer of terrace bay to buchanan 
we agreed to pay the plaintiffs approximately million canadian dollars as part of the settlement and recorded a charge of million to continuing operations 
acquisition of neenah germany in october  we purchased the stock of fibermark services gmbh co 
kg and the stock of fibermark beteiligungs gmbh collectively  neenah germany for million in cash  including million paid in the first quarter of primarily for the adjusted value of working capital at the acquisition date 
the transaction was financed through available cash and debt drawn against our existing revolving credit facility 
the neenah germany assets consist of two mills located near munich  germany and a third mill near frankfurt  germany that produce a wide range of products  including transportation and other filter media  nonwoven wall coverings  masking and other tapes  abrasive backings  and specialized printing and coating substrates 
the results of neenah germany are being reported as part of our technical products segment and have been included in our consolidated financial results since the acquisition date 
acquisition of fox river in march  we acquired the stock of fox valley corporation and its subsidiary fox river paper company  llc collectively  fox river for million in cash net of cash acquired 
included in such acquisition costs were amounts for the repayment of debt  the payment of deferred employee compensation obligations of the acquired companies and fees and expenses directly related to the acquisition 
we financed the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt drawn against our existing revolving credit facility 
the fox river assets consist of four us paper mills and various related assets  producing premium fine papers with well known brands including starwhite  sundance  esse and oxford 
the acquisition of fox river strengthens our fine paper business by providing added scale and the ability to offer a broader array of premium branded products and better service to our customers 
we believe that the added scale provided by fox river will result in improved earnings but profit margins that are lower than those historically reported for our existing fine paper business 
the results of fox river are being reported as part of our fine paper segment and have been included in our consolidated financial results since the acquisition date 
during the second quarter of  we closed the housatonic mill  located near great barrington  massachusetts 
in june  we announced plans to permanently close the fine paper mill located in urbana  ohio the urbana mill 
manufacturing operations at the urbana mill ceased in september converting operations at the urbana mill are expected to be phased out over the first six months of the closure of the housatonic and urbana mills  will allow us to maximize cost efficiencies by shifting fine paper manufacturing to utilize available capacity at our other fine paper mills 
in addition  we have completed the process of identifying and notifying certain fox river sales and administrative employees who were terminated as the acquired business was integrated with our existing fine paper business 
in conjunction with the acquisition of fox river  we recorded liabilities of approximately million for the cost of post acquisition restructuring activities in accordance with emerging issues task force issue recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
such costs include severance benefits  contract termination costs and environmental clean up and monitoring costs 
for the year ended december   we made payments of approximately million related to post acquisition restructuring activities 
results of continuing operations for the year ended december   our operating results benefited from the strategic initiatives described above as consolidated net sales increased percent 
consolidated net sales were million higher in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volume in our paper businesses from the acquisitions of neenah germany and fox river 
consolidated operating income of million for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to a gain of million on the sale of woodlands in the prior year 
excluding the gain on sale of the woodlands and the related recognition of million of the deferred gain on the sale of woodlands in the current year  operating income increased by million 
the increase versus the prior year was primarily due to incremental earnings of neenah germany  higher average selling prices  particularly prices for softwood pulp at our pictou mill  and the absence in of losses on pulp price hedges in the prior year 
the benefits of increased volume from fox river were largely offset by a less favorable product mix due to the inclusion of fox river volume with relatively lower margins  the addition of direct selling and administrative costs for fox river  and costs related to the integration of fox river and our existing fine paper operations 
results of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we incurred an after tax loss from discontinued operations of million compared to an after tax loss of million in the prior year period 
the loss in the current year is primarily due to costs associated with employee benefit obligations retained by neenah canada 
in august  we initiated the process to settle our pension obligations under the ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan the ontario plan 
in july  the financial services commission of ontario approved our request to settle our pension obligations for active employees and terminate the ontario plan 
in december  the ontario plan was terminated and all outstanding pension obligations for active employees were settled through the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum payments pursuant to participant elections 
neenah canada recognized a non cash pre tax settlement loss of million upon termination of the ontario plan 
no additional funding was required to settle the ontario plan 
for the year ended december   net sales from discontinued operations of million were primarily due to the liquidation of finished goods inventory during the suspension of manufacturing operations at terrace bay 
for the year ended december   we did not have any sales from discontinued operations due to the transfer of terrace bay to buchanan in august for the year ended december   the loss from discontinued operations includes pre tax losses of million related to the curtailment of the ontario plan and million to recognize the loss on the assets transferred to buchanan 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense related to continuing operations of million compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year period 
as a result  our effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and was approximately percent and percent  respectively 
during the year ended december   german tax laws were amended to reduce statutory income tax rates effective as of january  application of the new rates to our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities reduced our net deferred tax liabilities at december  the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities due to the benefit of the tax rate change resulted in an income tax benefit of million and was treated as a discrete item for the year ended december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and had no further impact on our effective tax rate in excluding the impact of the german tax law amendment on our deferred tax liabilities and other tax adjustments  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately percent and we expect an additional three percentage point decrease in our effective income tax rate in when the new german tax law becomes effective 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
there was no material effect on the financial statements and no cumulative effect on retained earnings from our adoption of fin however  certain amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet to comply with the requirements of fin as of january   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and  as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a million increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
as of december   our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
if recognized  approximately million of the unrecognized income tax benefits at december  would favorably affect our effective tax rate in future periods 
we do not anticipate that the expiration of the statute of limitations or the settlement of audits in the next months will result in liabilities for uncertain income tax positions that are materially different than the amounts accrued as of december  in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value in sfas retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value and emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
sfas expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
most of the provisions of sfas apply only to entities that elect the fair value option 
however  the amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in addition  sfas r will require  subsequent to the acquisition period  changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition to be recognized as a component of income tax expense 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations completed during annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are evaluating sfas r and will apply the provisions of the new standard to business combinations completed on or after january  analysis of net sales years ended december   and the following table presents net sales by segment  expressed as a percentage of total net sales before intersegment eliminations year ended december  fine paper technical products pulp total the following table presents our net sales by segment for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales fine paper technical products pulp intersegment sales consolidated commentary year versus change in net sales compared to the prior year change due to total change volume average net price fine paper technical products pulp a b intersegment sales consolidated a sales of pulp by our canadian manufacturing facilities are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operations

these capital expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
financing commentary our liquidity requirements are being provided by cash generated from operations  proceeds from asset sales and short and long term borrowings 
availability under our revolving credit facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  outstanding letters of credit of million and million of available credit

our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond  however  will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and cost cutting initiatives and to manage the impact of changes in pulp prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement those strategies and cost cutting initiatives or successfully manage our pulp pricing and currency exposures 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions beyond total unconditional purchase obligations long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt other post employment benefit obligations operating leases open purchase orders contributions to pension trusts liability for uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials  primarily wood chips and timber under the fsa 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
interest payments on long term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at december  weighted average interest rates 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next year for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
the above table includes future payments that we will make for post employment benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of neenah s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board fob shipping point 
for pulp sales to kimberly clark and other customers that are designated fob destination  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns 
reserves for cash discounts  trade allowances and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
canadian and german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using either the first in  first out fifo or a weighted average cost method  or market 
the fifo value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
inventories of the canadian pulp operations include both roundwood logs and wood chips 
these inventories are located both at the pulp mills and at various timberlands locations 
in accordance with industry practice  physical inventory counts utilize scaling techniques to estimate quantities of roundwood  as well as various electronic devices to calculate wood chip inventory amounts 
these techniques historically have provided reasonable estimates of such inventories 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  and have established no valuation allowances against these deferred income tax assets 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
pension benefits substantially all active employees of our us paper operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans 
in november  we assumed responsibility for pension and post employment benefit obligations for active employees of the pulp and paper business and former employees of the pulp business in canada 
in august  neenah canada purchased annuity contracts to settle its obligations under the ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan the ontario plan for former employees of terrace bay 
in july  the financial services commission of ontario approved our request to settle our pension obligations for active employees and terminate the ontario plan 
in december  the ontario plan was terminated and all outstanding pension obligations were settled through the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum payments pursuant to participant elections 
for the year ended december   neenah canada recognized a non cash pre tax settlement loss of million upon termination of the ontario plan 
substantially all of neenah germany s hourly employees participate in defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany s benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for the year ended december   includes million for losses related to the settlement of pension obligations for active employees in the ontario plan 
in addition  we recognized a reduction in pension expense of million related to an amendment to the fox river defined benefit pension plan to freeze the vested pension benefit for salaried employees born after december  pension expense for the year ended december   includes million for settlement and curtailment losses related to the settlement of pension obligations for current retirees in the ontario plan 
pension expense for the year ended december  includes a pre tax charge of million for a partial settlement of certain pension obligations related to the closure of the no 
pulp mill at terrace bay 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for both our us and canadian plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in canada is generally based on the government of canada long bond rate plus the spread for a long term aa rated bond index over the yield on year us treasury bonds converted to an equivalent one year compound basis 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million decreased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   as assets transferred from the fox river pension plans of million and currency effects of million  were more than offset by benefit payments including payments to settle the ontario plan of million 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million lower than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  including million to purchase annuity contracts to settle pension obligations for current retirees in the ontario plan 
in addition  we made direct benefit payments of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million in each of the years ended december  and for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits 
impairment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach in combination with an estimate of future cash flows and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
an adjustment goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
goodwill was last tested for impairment as of november  and no impairment was indicated 
acquired intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not being amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation cost recognized under sfas r consists of a compensation cost for all unvested stock based grants outstanding as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
sfas r amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows  to require the reporting of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock based awards as cash provided by financing activities rather than as a reduction in income taxes paid and reported as cash provided by operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our reported results of operations are affected by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on our financial results because substantially all of our pulp mill s expenses are incurred in canadian dollars and our pulp revenues are denominated in us dollars 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in the canadian dollar relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million  excluding additional currency re measurement losses 
in addition  our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent increase in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar and the euro relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively 
our exposure to such exchange risk on reported operating results is not hedged 
from time to time  we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in a notional amount of million canadian dollars designated as cash flow hedges of u 
s dollar denominated pulp sales 
the fair value of the contracts was a current asset of million us dollars 
the weighted average exchange rate for the foreign currency contracts at december  was us dollars per canadian dollar and the contracts extend through february currency transactional exposures are also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on our pre tax income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar and the euro versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are as follows 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro involving balance sheet transactional exposure would have resulted in net pre tax losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
finally  the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations from canadian dollars into us dollars and our german operations from euros into us dollars also are sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and euro  respectively 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations and german operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our canadian and german operations by a percent change in the us canadian and us euro exchange rates  respectively 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the us dollar against the euro would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical increase in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
commodity risk pulp our results of operations  cash flows and financial position are sensitive to the selling prices of wood pulp 
wood pulp is a commodity for which there are multiple other suppliers 
typically  commodities businesses compete primarily on the basis of price and availability 
the revenues from producing a commodity tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising prices leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced prices and excess and idle capacity until the cycle is repeated 
the markets and profitability of pulp have been  and are likely to continue to be  cyclical 
because our pulp business competes primarily on the basis of price and availability  the financial success of our pulp mills depends on their ability to produce pulp at a competitive cost 
accordingly  we must continuously and effectively manage our cost structure and production capacity to be able to respond effectively to business cycles in the pulp industry 
from time to time  we have used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to pulp price fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
during and  we entered into a series of pulp futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in pulp prices through december at december  and  we had no outstanding pulp future contracts 
based on shipment volume  a percent decrease in the market price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp excluding the impact of volume and other discounts would reduce pretax income of our pulp segment by approximately million 
raw materials we purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials and energy necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our raw material or energy prices and generally do not possess enough power to pass increases in those prices along to purchasers of our products  unless those increases coincide with increased demand for the product 
therefore  an increase in raw material or energy prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we obtain a portion of the wood fiber required for the pictou pulp mill from timberland areas licensed by the nova scotia provincial government 
the government has granted us non exclusive licenses for substantial timberland areas from which we obtain fiber  and we also obtain fiber harvested from timberland areas licensed to others by this government 
there can be no assurance that the amount of fiber that we are allowed to harvest from these licensed areas will not be decreased  or that our licenses will continue to be renewed or extended by the governments on acceptable terms 
in the area where our pictou mill is located  there is increasing competition for wood fiber from various other users 
changes in governmental practices and policies as they apply to us and to others from whom we obtain fiber may result in less fiber being available  increased costs to obtain the fiber and additional expense in meeting forestry standards 
these results could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in  two suppliers provided over percent of the wood chips used by the pictou mill 
while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies  such as wood chips  would be available  disruption of our primary sources could create a temporary  adverse effect on product shipments 
also  an interruption in supply of single source specialty grade latex or specialty softwood pulp to our technical products business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising and pictou mills and approximately percent of the electrical energy at our bruckm hl and appleton mills 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase thousand pounds per year of green steam to supply energy at our neenah paper mill 
we anticipate that the agreement will substantially reduce the mill s annual consumption of natural gas 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate long term debt and our variable rate bank debt 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows from our variable rate debt and on the market value of our fixed rate debt 
at december   we had million of long term fixed rate debt outstanding and million of long term variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of our fixed rate long term debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes or rates currently available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 
we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  canada  germany and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
following the completion of engineering studies and negotiations with local authorities and other interested parties in canada  we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures would be required at the pictou mill related to the effluent treatment system  total sulphur emissions or other environmental matters until or later 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
