item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts  and where noted 
the folowing comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in the increase was due mostly to an increase in cash and investments resulting from continued excellent operating profitability  but also to a weakening us dollar usd which increased the net book value of ireland fixed assets which were down by in euro terms by or in usd terms 
the productivity of total assets average total asset turns  total sales divided by average total assets for the year was lower than in because sales were lower and ending total assets higher 
both years productivity was diluted by utmd s large cash equivalent balances 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
year end cash and investment balances increased  despite utmd paying  in shareholder dividends   in share repurchases  and  in principal repayments on the ireland loan 
excluding average cash and investment balances  average total asset turns were in both and in  total assets excluding cash and investment balances will continue to be substantially less than annual sales  which benefits return on average shareholders equity roe 
improvement in total asset turns including cash and investments will depend on the timing of deployment of excess cash and investment balances 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility as a result of the cmi acquisition  and a portion of its midvale  utah parking lot 
in  net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets increased despite the fact that actual depreciation of assets exceeded new capital expenditures by as noted above  the increase in net pp e was due to currency exchange translation of preexisting ireland assets which appreciated in usd terms 
the net book value of us pp e assets decreased the increase in consolidated pp e while sales decreased resulted in lower pp e turns 
the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e is of actual acquisition cost 
since current pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of the company s fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  depreciation of fixed assets should again equal or exceed new pp e purchases required to sustain current operations 
average inventory turns in increased to from in  continuing to meet management s objective for inventory turns  despite lower sales 
this continued the trend of more efficient use of inventories since net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances increased or about at the same time that sales activity decreased  increasing average days in a r on december  to days  based on q shipments  compared to days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date at year end were of a r  up from at the end of the prior year 
the company believes the older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both of these amounts exceed working capital needs for internally financing growth in normal operations 
utmd s current ratio increased to from  mainly due to increases in cash and investments  but also helped by a significant decrease in year end a p balances 
the progression in the current ratio since indicates a continued strengthening of utmd s financial position 
since the large majority of the working capital balance is excess cash and cash investments  the current ratio going forward in will depend primarily upon the timing and extent of use of existing cash and investment balances for other than normal operating needs 
the other current asset and current liability components of working capital are expected to remain within management objectives  consistent with and earlier years 
net after accumulated amortization intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  at the end of the goodwill net balance of  has been reduced by from acquisition cost as a result of utmd using previous gaap through for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
under current gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in utmd does not expect the goodwill value of the acquisitions to become impaired in purchases of other intangibles of in were offset by in amortization expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets compared to at the end of liabilities 
in  utmd s current liabilities decreased  and total liabilities decreased  from the end of the resulting ending total debt ratio was of total assets  down from a total debt ratio of at the end of current liabilities declined because of a normal fluctuation in timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the ireland note payable  denominated in euros  declined just in usd book value despite actual principal payments of  because the decline in the value of the usd increased the remaining euro balance in usd terms by 
in euros  the note declined from  at the beginning of to  both in thousands at the end of as a reminder to shareholders  the note was initiated in december to finance repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
plans to repay this note from profits generated in ireland over the next three to four years 
in addition to liabilities on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales decreased from  in to  in about 
global consolidated sales in were domestic sales decreased from  in to  in about 
in  domestic sales were  utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct domestic sales were in all three years of  and therefore  domestic oem sales were of total domestic sales in all three years 
domestic direct sales in represented of global consolidated sales in compared to in  and in international foreign sales increased from  in to  in about 
in  international sales were  international sales grew to of global consolidated sales in compared to in  and in of the international sales  were distributed to customers in europe  compared to in and in ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
trade shipments were up in euro terms and up in usd terms compared to utmd groups its sales into four general product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary explanation of revenues in the above tables  the decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was primarily the result of the restrictive effects of us gpo administrative agreements 
for example  gpo restrictions included a sole source contract consummated by healthtrust purchasing group hpg with a utmd competitor for iupcs and vads which took effect on september  these specialty catheters and surgical tools are clearly in the category of clinician preference products 
the hpg sole source agreement violates the mandate by the us senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee in april that gpos only allow multi source contracting for clinician preference products  as well as the ensuing healthcare group purchasing industry initiative code of ethics  of which hpg was a founding member 
it also represented a violation of hpg s own code of ethics  which states in section hpg  no gpo should come between hospital administration and their physicians when it comes to the choice of medical devices needed to treat the patient 
to this end  healthtrust offers a complete line of contracts in these areas 
clinician preference products 
that provides substantial choice to our members and their physicians 
in the us  sales of intrauterine pressure catheters iupcs declined and sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads declined  a total us iupc and vads decline of  the silver lining of this decline is that the company s reliance on a single product is much less concentrated  ie  in  ie iupc sales were of total sales compared to when us iupc sales were of total sales million higher 
the  decline in us iupc and vads sales but only decline in total sales suggests that utmd s sales of its other products and its international business are expanding 
in  other us l d product sales excluding iupc and vads increased  and sales of all l d products internationally increased 
international gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product sales increased  while us es gyn sales declined the decline in us es gyn sales resulted from lower sales of letz electrodes of in the us  the american society for colposcopy and cervical pathology asccp published revised guidelines for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin which advised greater monitoring of lower grade lesions in lieu of surgical treatment  which includes letz loop excision of the transformation zone 
international neonatal product nicu sales increased in  while us nicu sales declined the international sales continue a trend of increasing acceptance of utmd s nicu devices in foreign countries 
in the us  because products in this category are sold to hospitals  sales are also affected by gpo restrictions 
because the nicu devices are diverse and lower volume than in l d  and because of the special nature of the patients  utmd believes that clinicians remain more heavily involved in product selection  and therefore us gpo administrative deals are less of a challenge in this nicu category than for l d 
international blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales increased  while domestic bpm sales decreased this category includes molded components some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies for use in their products oem sales 
in contrast to the other product categories  international sales comprise most in and in of bpm sales 
utmd depends on successful sales and marketing by other companies internationally  too 
sales to utmd s largest foreign oem customer  pulsion medical systems ag  in germany  increased approximately in the decline in us bpm sales in compared to is primarily a function of the timing of domestic oem orders  which are generally for larger quantities of components and are ordered infrequently 
virtually all of utmd s domestic oem sales were included in the bpm category in looking forward to  utmd s improvement in domestic direct sales depends on its ability to obtain medical staff involvement in purchasing decisions for utmd s physician preference products used in us hospitals where administrators are making the product decisions through the use of gpos contracts awarded on bases which may not adequately take into consideration the total cost of patient care  which includes complication rates and longer term health outcomes 
an important factor in utmd s ability to compete in this administratively cumbersome environment is its continuing ability to develop devices that are clearly differentiated on the basis of patient safety and better health outcomes 
internationally  utmd expects continued expansion in clinical acceptance of its specialty products  particularly where the standard of living is increasing in lesser developed countries 
excluding the possibility of acquisition of a new product line with established sales  management projects a overall revenue increase in this assumes a increase in domestic sales from new products despite a projected continued decline in us iupc sales  and a increase in international sales  which is conservative compared to recent experience 
b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products cgs from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in because of competition and a number of long term fixed pricing agreements  utmd had a limited ability to increase product prices in at the same time that direct labor and direct materials costs were increasing fairly substantially 
beginning in september  utmd offered its hpg customers a iupc price reduction to encourage them to ignore the sole source gpo contract with a competitor 
this accounted for about of the gross profit decline in q also  because of the disparity in profitability of utmd s domestic sales compared to international sales  the sales mix by distribution channel had an unfavorable impact on the overall average margin compared to the prior two years 
in ireland  where manufacturing costs in euro terms increased  the gross margin was further reduced by a number of fixed pricing agreements established in usd terms  since the value of the usd declined by about relative to the euro 
utmd possesses facilities and other manufacturing infrastructure well in excess of its current needs 
as a result  it projects that dilution of fixed overhead costs from higher sales will help offset anticipated continued direct labor and materials cost increases in the company believes that it can continue to meet its gpm objective of in utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in compared to  in  and  in litigation expenses and stock option compensation expense estimated by using a black scholes pricing model are included as part of g a expenses 
all other g a expenses remained very consistent for the three years both lawsuits noted below  in which utmd prevailed on all counts  have been concluded r d expenses s m expenses g a fda litigation expenses g a cia litigation expenses g a stock option compensation expense n a g a all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating income in was  compared to  in  and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating income divided by total sales was in compared to in  and in the margin is substantially lower since there were litigation expenses in that year that were unrelated to sales activity 
looking forward to  utmd expects to control operating expenses to achieve operating income consistent with i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that solicit product sales and provide customer support across the us as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in in utmd intends to increase s m expenses to a level closer to s m expenses in and  but hold the ratio to total sales to about 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing premarketing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in  and in in  utmd will opportunistically invest in r d in order to reinvigorate its product development pipeline 
r d expenses are expected to increase marginally 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  risk management  protection of intellectual property  and legal costs 
starting in  g a expenses also included estimated stock option compensation expense  which was in and in in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage those front office functions  g a expenses include outside director fees and expenses  outside legal counsels and litigation experts fees  independent accounting audit fees including auditing for internal controls under sox  k plan administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  general business insurance and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in g a expenses excluding litigation expenses were  and of sales in  and  respectively  which may provide a clearer indication of g a expenses free of disputes that require litigation 
total litigation expenses in the three years of were  plus a reduction of utmd s litigation reserve of  utmd s out of pocket costs of the dispute with the fda which culminated in an unwarranted lawsuit were  the out of pocket costs associated with utmd s defense of a meritless patent infringement claim by cia were there were no litigation expenses during the three years related to product liability 
in  utmd plans to hold g a expenses excluding any litigation expenses at a ratio of sales consistent with the prior three years 
there are no current lawsuits which utmd expects will result in significant litigation costs 
d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest on the ireland bank loan and bank service fees 
non operating income was  in   in and in the higher income resulted from capital gains from investments realized in that year 
royalties received were in all three years  which came from one source 
the licensed patents for which the royalties have been received are due to expire starting in august  with the last one expiring in august annual royalty payments due utmd under the license agreement were capped at the royalty rate of each unexpired patent will continue to achieve the maximum royalty until august  based on the current sales volume of applicable products subject to the license of utmd patents 
in  utmd paid in interest compared to in and in the interest resulted from borrowing million  in december to allow the repatriation in of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since utmd expects interest expense of about in as a result of the ireland note payable 
although average loan balances will be lower in  utmd expects the average conversion rate of the usd from the euro will be higher than in weaker dollar on the average  offsetting some of the lower interest when converting the expense into usd terms 
utmd expects its non operating income will be about lower than in because of projected lower interest rates in the us the actual amount of non operating income may be even lower if utmd utilizes excess cash for an acquisition  unexpected litigation costs or substantial share repurchases 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating income 
ebt was  in compared to  in  and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s ebt margin was  and in  and  respectively 
utmd is targeting ebt of about  as operating income is projected to be about the same and non operating income is projected to be about lower than in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was   and  in  and respectively 
the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and respectively 
the significantly lower income tax provision in was a result of the american jobs creation act of the act enacted in october which allowed a temporary tax deduction on repatriated foreign earnings accomplished in prior to  utmd included a deferred tax liability in reported results  anticipating that profits generated by its ireland facility would eventually be repatriated  triggering us income taxes 
also  utmd recorded a favorable deferred tax liability adjustment after the conclusion of an irs audit in q these were non recurring tax benefits limited to the year which provided the much lower tax provision in that year 
other year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental income  special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects the consolidated income tax provision rate to remain about the same as in the prior year 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales was  and for years  and  respectively 
utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  and in  and  respectively 
utmd s eps has grown at an annually compounded rate of per year during the ten years since the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in  and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in and in the total number of options outstanding at year end declined from year end dilution decreased in from because the average number of options outstanding decreased  even though a slightly higher average share price in the stock market increased the dilutive effect of each option 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was before dividends compared to before dividends in  and before dividends in utmd s roe is primarily driven by its high net profit margin  which in remained consistent with prior years 
roe was diluted by lower total asset turns as utmd continued to grow its cash balances  and by a lower debt ratio as utmd continued to repay its bank loan in ireland without increasing other liabilities 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without having to issue more stock 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or more actively repurchase shares  roe will be lower than because net profitability is projected to be slightly lower while average shareholders equity and dividends increase  and total asset turns and financial leverage decrease 
retaining a high cash balance which returns only about dilutes overall roe 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in compared to  in  and  in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities in was lower due to a decrease of in net profits  and a smaller increase in accrued interest and other receivables  among other changes that were generally consistent with excellent balance sheet management in the presence of slightly lower sales activity the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of liquid investments  in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
utmd expended  in on such purchases compared to  in  and  in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments compared to  in  and  in no acquisitions requiring investment of cash were made in or in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
employees exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of some optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in comparison  in utmd received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees and directors trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price and related tax withholding subject to statutory limitations 
utmd paid  in to meet tax withholding requirements on options exercised  but received a  tax benefit from those exercises 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
utmd did not borrow during or in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed million  to allow repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since  per the american jobs creation act of in  utmd made repayments of  on the ireland note  compared to  in although utmd has not borrowed under its revolving line of credit since it paid off the balance in  the line of credit is used to guarantee the current ireland loan in order to achieve favorable credit terms 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be less than to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition  utmd may use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases when the price of the stock is undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
the us revolving line of credit will continue to be available for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time not otherwise available from existing cash and investment balances 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology and or processes  to acquire a product line that will augment revenue growth and better utilize utmd s existing infrastructure  and or to repurchase utmd shares in the open marketplace 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to fight to retain its significant us market shares of established key specialty products  accelerate revenue growth of newer products  develop proprietary products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development  continue to disproportionately increase international sales  continue outstanding overall financial operating performance  look for new acquisitions to augment sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest  including continued cash dividends and open market share repurchases 
the safety  reliability and performance of utmd s products are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product without understanding the total cost of care which includes risk of unwanted complications and unnecessary utilization 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
utmd s passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus and does not seek revenue growth as its primary motivation 
its fundamental focus is to do an excellent job in meeting customers and patients needs  while providing shareholders with excellent returns 
looking back seven years to the end of from the end of  utmd s eps have more than doubled up while the year ending share price has increased almost four times up  providing long term shareholders with excellent returns 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia indices were up  and  respectively  over that same time span 
in  while the year ending share price decreased  utmd increased dividends share actually paid to shareholders by from 
in to 
in  decreased diluted shares outstanding by and decreased outstanding unexercised options by 
this was accomplished in by utmd again achieving a high positive cash flow by meeting its profitability goals  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below the rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to be able to finance a substantial acquisition in without issuing stock  should an attractive one become available 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies  products or technologies that will enhance its specialist focus  but not significantly increase its business risk and not dilute its financial performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s resources increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates 
accounting policy changes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this statement clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
the company or one of its subsidiaries files or has filed income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  in various states and in ireland 
with few exceptions  utmd is no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before in  the internal revenue service examined the company s federal income tax returns for and suggested one immaterial adjustment which the company made 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  utmd did not make any adjustment to opening retained earnings as a result of the implementation 
the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits along with penalties in operating expenses 
during the years ended december   and  the company did not recognize any interest or penalties relating to income taxes 
utmd did not have any accrual for the payment of interest or penalties at december   or item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had manufacturing operations  including related assets  in ireland denominated in the euro  and sold products under agreements denominated in various western european currencies 
the euro and other currencies have been and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of utmd 
the exchange rate for the euro was  
and 
per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
please see note in item   below under translation of foreign currencies for more information 
utmd manages its foreign currency risk without separate hedging transactions by converting currencies as transactions occur
