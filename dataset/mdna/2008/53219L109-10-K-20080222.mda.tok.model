we recommend that you read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
unless otherwise indicated  all relevant financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations 
overview our revenues for as compared to were favorably impacted by an increase in revenues per equivalent admission and the acquisition of clinch valley medical center clinch valley and raleigh general hospital raleigh 
our income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for  as compared to  were negatively affected by increases in our provision for doubtful accounts  professional fees expense and contract labor 
the following table reflects our summarized operating results for the periods presented in millions  except per share amounts revenues income from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from continuing operations key challenges we anticipate increasing our revenues and profitability on both a long term and short term basis 
however  we have the following internal and external key challenges to overcome inpatient volumes 
we have experienced a decline in our inpatient volumes during the later half of this was the result of physician attrition in several of our markets  lack of disease across our markets  the closure of certain unprofitable service lines at a few of our hospitals and the long term industry trend of inpatient services shifting to outpatient services 
we will focus on adding or further emphasizing service lines that are needed in our communities 
increases in provision for doubtful accounts 
we have experienced an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts during recent years 
these increases were the result of an increased number of uninsured patients and an increase in co payments and deductibles from healthcare plan design changes 
these changes increase collection costs and reduce overall cash collections 
our quarterly provision for doubtful accounts on a consolidated basis  which comprises our continuing and discontinued operations was as follows for the periods presented in millions provision for doubtful accounts first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter our revenues decrease when we write off patient accounts identified as charity and indigent care 
our hospitals write off a portion of a patient s account upon the determination that the patient qualifies under the hospital s charity indigent care policy 
in the event that a patient account was previously classified as self pay when the determination of charity indigent status is made  a corresponding reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts may occur 
the following table reflects our quarterly consolidated charity and indigent care write offs for the periods presented in millions charity and indigent care write offs first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as charity and indigent care write offs  relate primarily to self pay revenues 
the following table reflects our quarterly consolidated self pay revenues  net of charity and indigent care write offs  for the periods presented in millions self pay revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the following table shows our consolidated revenue days outstanding reflected in our consolidated net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated revenue days outstanding in accounts receivable march june september december the approximate percentages of billed hospital receivables  which is a component of total accounts receivable  are summarized as follows as of the dates presented december  december  insured receivables uninsured receivables including co payments and deductibles the approximate percentages of billed hospital receivables in summarized aging categories are as follows as of the dates presented december  december  to days to days over days we continue to implement a number of operating strategies related to cash collections 
however  if the trend of increasing self pay revenues continues  our future results of operations and future financial position could be materially adversely affected 
physician recruitment and retention 
recruiting  attracting and retaining both primary care physicians and specialists for our non urban communities is a key to increasing revenues  patient volumes and the value that the communities place on our hospitals 
the medical staffs at our hospitals are typically small and our revenues are negatively affected by the loss of physicians 
we believe that continuing to add primary care physicians and specialists should help our hospitals increase volumes by offering new services 
physician attrition is also a challenge for us 
challenges in professional and general liability costs 
professional and general liability costs remain a challenge to us and we expect this pressure to continue in the future 
additionally  we experienced unfavorable claims development results in  which are reflected in our professional and general liability costs 
shortage of clinical personnel and increased contract labor usage 
in recent years  many hospitals  including some of the hospitals we own  have encountered difficulty in recruiting and retaining nurses and other clinical personnel 
when we are unable to staff our nursing and other clinical positions  we are required to use contract labor to ensure adequate patient care 
contract labor generally costs more per hour than employed labor 
we have adopted a number of human resources strategies in an attempt to improve our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical personnel 
however  we expect that staffing issues related to nurses and other clinical personnel will continue in the future 
additionally  we have incurred an increase in professional fees primarily for anesthesiology  radiology  and emergency room services 
our expense for professional fees paid to hospital based physicians has increased as the shortage of these physicians becomes more acute 
indebtedness 
our consolidated debt was  million as of december   and we incurred million of net interest expense during our indebtedness decreases our net income and reduces the amount of funds available for operations  capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
we are in compliance with our financial debt covenants as of december  and believe we will be in compliance with them throughout medicare changes implementation of medicare severity diagnosis related groups 
changes with respect to governmental reimbursement affect our revenues and earnings 
on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued its hospital inpatient prospective payment system final rule for ffy among other items  the final rule creates new severity adjusted diagnosis related groups medicare severity drgs or ms drgs to replace medicare s current drgs 
under the final rule  the new ms drgs will be phased in over a two year period 
in addition  the final rule also provides for a market basket increase of in ffy for hospitals that report certain patient care quality measures and an increase of for hospitals that do not submit this information 
however  to offset the effect of the coding and discharge classification changes that cms believes will occur as hospitals implement the ms drg system  the final rule also reduces medicare payments to hospitals by in federal fiscal year and in both ffy and subsequently  on september   president bush signed public law no  effectively decreasing these reductions for ffy and to and 
cms plans to conduct a look back beginning in ffy and make appropriate changes to the reduction percentages based on actual claims data 
cms anticipates that the final rule will result in an increase in payments to hospitals that serve more severely ill patients and a decrease to hospitals that serve patients who are less severely ill 
although difficult to predict  the implementation of the ms drg system and the other provisions of the final rule may result in our medicare acute inpatient hospital reimbursement remaining flat in ffy part i  item business  sources of revenue contains a detailed discussion of provisions that affect our medicare reimbursement  including the medicare hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient  and inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment systems 
medicare changes medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system 
on november   cms issued its final hospital outpatient prospective payment system rule for calendar year among other provisions  this includes a market basket update and requires hospitals to begin reporting seven hospital outpatient quality measures 
beginning in calendar year  the annual payment update factor will be reduced by percentage points for hospitals that do not report those measures 
medicare changes inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system 
on july   cms published its medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system final rule for ffy the final rule increases the inpatient rehabilitation facility irf payment rate by and the high cost outlier threshold from  to  for ffy the final rule also continues the phase in of the requirement that at least of an irf s patients have one of designated medical conditions the rule which has resulted in decreased volume in our rehabilitation units 
however  the medicare  medicaid  and schip extension act of  enacted december  the extension act permanently freezes the compliance threshold at effective for cost reporting periods starting july   and allows co morbid conditions to count toward this threshold 
medicaid changes 
states have adopted  or may be considering  legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility  enroll medicaid recipients in managed care programs and or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states medicaid systems 
the legislation passed by the new mexico legislature in february is one example of this 
future legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
on may   cms issued a final rule entitled medicaid program  cost limit for providers operated by units of government and provisions to ensure the integrity of federal state financial partnership  which was expected to reduce federal medicaid funding by billion over five years 
also on this date  president bush signed into law hr  placing a moratorium on this rule for one year 
however  when the moratorium expires in  this final rule could significantly impact state medicaid programs and our revenue from these programs 
increases in supply costs 
during the past few years  we have experienced an increase in supply costs per equivalent admission  especially in the areas of pharmaceutical  orthopedic  oncology and cardiac supplies 
we participate in a group purchasing organization in an attempt to achieve lower supply costs from our vendors 
because of the fixed reimbursement nature of most governmental and commercial payor arrangements  we may not be able to recover supply cost increases through increased revenues 
increases in information technology costs and costs of integration 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems to process clinical and financial information 
our acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  various information systems that are used by hospitals we acquire 
we rely heavily on hca it for information systems integration pursuant to our contractual arrangement for information technology services 
under a contract with a term that will expire on december   hca it provides us with financial  clinical  patient accounting and network information systems 
we are currently negotiating with hca it to extend the hca it agreement beyond hospital acquisitions we seek to identify and acquire selected hospitals in non urban communities 
in evaluating a hospital for acquisition  we focus on a variety of factors 
one factor we consider is the number of patients that are traveling outside of the community for healthcare services 
another factor we consider is the hospital s prior operating history and our ability to implement new healthcare services 
in addition  we review the local demographics and expected future trends 
upon acquiring a facility  we work to integrate the hospital quickly into our operating practices 
please refer to the section in part i  item properties  for a table of our hospitals  including acquisition dates 
additionally  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of acquisitions that we have made in recent years 
our results of operations include the operations of our acquisitions since the effective date of each acquisition 
in connection with the final purchase price allocation of the acquisition of clinch valley and raleigh  we recognized an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  during this increased depreciation and amortization expense was the result of higher values of certain buildings  equipment and intangible assets than we originally anticipated in the preliminary purchase price allocation 
in connection with the finalization of the purchase price allocations of both danville regional medical center and province  we recognized a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million million net of income taxes  or per diluted share during this decreased depreciation expense was the result of lower fair values of certain property and equipment than we originally anticipated in the preliminary purchase price allocations 
discontinued operations from time to time  we evaluate our facilities and may sell assets which we believe may no longer fit with our long term strategy for various reasons 
coastal carolina medical center coastal effective july   we completed the sale of coastal to tenet healthcare corporation for million plus adjustments for working capital and other items 
in connection with the sale  we recognized an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  in discontinued operations during the following table sets forth the calculation of coastal s impairment charge during in millions cash proceeds from sale less assets sold property and equipment goodwill intangible assets net working capital income tax provision colorado river medical center colorado river in march  we signed a letter of intent with the board of trustees of needles desert communities hospital the board of trustees to transfer to the board of trustees substantially all of the operating assets and net working capital of colorado river plus million in cash  which approximates the net present value of future lease payments due under the lease agreement between the board of trustees and us in consideration for the termination of the existing operating lease agreement 
subsequently  in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with the board of trustees that terminates the existing lease agreement effective march colorado river will return to the board of trustees at that time 
in connection with the signing of the letter of intent and definitive agreement  we recognized an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  in discontinued operations during the impairment charge relates to goodwill impairment  the property and equipment and net working capital to be transferred to the board of trustees  for which we anticipate receiving no consideration 
the following table sets forth the components of colorado river s impairment charge during in millions property and equipment net working capital goodwill income tax benefit other disposals in connection with the acquisition of four hospitals from hca effective july   we committed to a plan to divest two of the acquired hospitals  st 
joseph s hospital st 
joseph s and saint francis hospital saint francis 
we sold saint francis effective january  to herbert j 
thomas memorial hospital association and st 
joseph s effective may  to signature hospital  llc 
on march   we sold smith county memorial hospital to sumner regional health system  and  effective may   we sold medical center of southern indiana and ashland regional medical center to saint catherine healthcare 
additionally  we divested palo verde hospital on january  by terminating our lease of that hospital and returning the hospital to the hospital district of palo verde 
finally  we sold bartow memorial hospital on march  to health management associates  inc please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our discontinued operations 
the following table reflects our summarized operating results of discontinued operations for the periods presented in millions  except per share amounts revenues loss from discontinued operations impairment charge gain loss on sale of hospitals income loss from discontinued operations diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations summary each of our challenges are intensified by our inability to control related trends and the associated risks 
therefore  our actual results may differ from our expectations 
to maintain or improve operating margins in the future  we must  among other things  increase patient volumes through physician recruiting  relationships and retention while controlling the costs of providing services 
revenue sources our hospitals generate revenues by providing healthcare services to our patients 
the majority of these healthcare services are directed by physicians 
we are paid for these healthcare services from a number of different sources  depending upon the patient s medical insurance coverage 
primarily  we are paid by governmental medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurance  including managed care organizations  and directly by the patient 
the amounts we are paid for providing healthcare services to our patients vary depending upon the payor 
governmental payors generally pay significantly less than the hospital s customary charges for the services provided 
please refer to part i  item business  sources of revenue for a detailed discussion of our revenue sources 
revenues from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  are controlled by complex rules and regulations that stipulate the amount a hospital is paid for providing healthcare services 
our compliance with these rules and regulations requires an extensive effort to ensure we remain eligible to participate in these governmental programs 
in addition  these rules and regulations are subject to frequent changes as a result of legislative and administrative action on both the federal and the state levels 
for these reasons  revenues from governmental programs change frequently and require us to monitor regularly the environment in which these governmental programs operate 
revenues from hmos  ppos and other private insurers are subject to contracts and other arrangements that require us to discount the amounts we customarily charge for healthcare services 
these discounted arrangements often limit our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs 
we actively negotiate with these payors to seek to maintain or increase the pricing of our healthcare services 
insured patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and the amounts received from commercial insurance payors 
however  insured patients are responsible for payments not covered by insurance  such as exclusions  deductibles and co payments 
self pay revenues are primarily generated through the treatment of uninsured patients 
our hospitals experienced an increase in self pay revenues during recent years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to our critical accounting estimates 
the table of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and our financial condition 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with uninsured patient receivables and deductibles  co payments or other amounts due from individual patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december was as follows in millions  and our provision for doubtful accounts from continuing operations  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows in millions  and the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts or self pay accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  if self pay revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
our estimates may be impacted by changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in federal or state governmental healthcare coverage 
a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off of the accounts 
our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is generally one year after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts continued responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improve performance results 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
as it relates to our recently acquired hospitals  we monitor trends in revenues and cash collections on a monthly basis for to months subsequent to the acquisition on a facility by facility basis 
as it relates to our core hospitals  which we refer to as same hospital  we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a month by month basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
the allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the former province facilities increased by million during  which resulted in a decrease in our diluted earnings per share of for  to conform the former province facilities allowance for doubtful accounts to our critical accounting estimate 
this adjustment constituted a change in the estimation process from the former province critical accounting estimate and is reflected as transaction costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the adjustment is the result of our review of province s patient accounts receivable and the application of the same assumptions and processes we use 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and accounts receivable are reduced to net realizable value through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately of our revenues during relate to discounted charges 
the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues medicare  medicaid  and revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided 
we utilize multiple patient accounting systems 
therefore  estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved and the patient accounting system used by each of our hospitals 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are determined manually using historical collections for each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience 
managed care 
governmental payors governmental payors the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
adjustments related to final settlements increased our revenues by the following amounts in millions  and discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in periods before  are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts continued managed care managed care accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials 
for most managed care plans  estimated contractual allowances are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages each month historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our managed care revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received based on payor contract provisions  historical collection data as well as other factors and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
applying our process to the accounts receivable from province s third party payors resulted in a million charge and decreased our diluted earnings per share by during to conform the former province facilities allowance for contractual discounts to our critical accounting estimate

accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock options and other stock based awards to key employees and directors under various stockholder approved stock based compensation plans 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
we did not record any stock based employee compensation we estimated the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended december  and using the hull white ii valuation model hw ii lattice option valuation model and a single option award approach 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted prior to january  using the black scholes merton bsm valuation model 
we prefer the hw ii over the bsm because the hw ii considers characteristics of fair the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant 
changes in our volatility estimates can materially affect the fair values of our stock option grants 
if our estimated weighted average volatility during were higher  our after tax income from continuing operations would decrease by approximately million  or less than per diluted share 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued expense for stock options granted under our stock based incentive plans prior to january   as all stock options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the day prior to the date of the grant 
we also did not record any compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan prior to january   as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market values of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
also  in accordance with apb  we recorded compensation expense for our nonvested stock awards 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 prior to january   we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and pro forma expense for our stock based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognized for the years ended december  and  included i compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
in march  the sec issued sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we determine the fair value of nonvested stock grants based on the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant date 
the nonvested stock requires no payment from employees and directors  and stock based compensation expense is recorded equally over the vesting periods three to five years 
value option pricing  such as an option s contractual term and the probability of exercise before the end of the contractual term  that are not available under the bsm 
in addition  the complications surrounding the expected term of an option are material  as clarified by the sec s focus on the matter in sab given our reasonably large pool of unexercised options  we believe a lattice model that specifically addresses this fact and models a full term of exercises is the most appropriate and reliable means of valuing our stock options 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting periods of three years 
the stock options that were granted during the years ended december  and vest on each grant anniversary date over three years of continued employment 
the weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted by us during was 
the following table shows the weighted average assumptions we used to develop the fair value estimates under our stock option valuation model for and the paragraphs below this table summarizes each assumption expected volatility risk free interest rate range expected dividends average expected term years population stratification under sfas no 
r  a company should aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
in addition  sab clarifies that a company may generally make a reasonable fair value estimate with as few as one or two groupings 
we have stratified our employee population into two groups i insiders  who are the section filers under sec rules  and ii non insiders  who are the rest of the employee population 
we derived this stratification based on the analysis of our historical exercise patterns  excluding certain extraordinary events 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued our stock based compensation from continuing operations  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows in millions  and expected volatility volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
historical volatility is still an appropriate starting point for setting this assumption under sfas no 
r 
according to sfas no 
r  companies should also consider how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
sfas no 
r and sab acknowledge that there is likely to be a range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that if a best estimate cannot be made  management should use the mid point in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
effective january  we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and sab risk free interest rate lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times of exercise obtained by using a grant date yield curve 
a lattice model would therefore require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options 
we base the risk free rate on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
expected dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued pre vesting forfeitures pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
sfas no 
r requires us to estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have used historical data to estimate pre vesting stock option and nonvested stock forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we also used an estimated forfeiture rate 
during  we changed from our static forfeiture rate methodology to a dynamic forfeiture rate methodology 
the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology incorporates the lapse of time into the resulting expense calculation and results in a forfeiture rate that diminishes as the granted awards approach its vest date 
accordingly  the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results in a more consistent stock compensation expense calculation over the vesting period of the award 
additionally  during  we performed an analysis of our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate percentage and increased our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate ranging from to  up to an initial pre vesting forfeiture rate of 
the increase in our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate reflects our recent forfeiture trends and future expectations 
as previously discussed  as we utilize the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology  this rate is updated and is reduced accordingly as time elapses until it ultimately reaches on the vesting date  contingent upon the continued employment of the grantee 
post vesting cancellations post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised 
lattice models treat post vesting cancellations and voluntary early exercise behavior as two separate assumptions 
we used historical data to estimate post vesting cancellations 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued expected term sfas no 
r calls for an extinguishment calculation  dependent upon how long a granted stock option remains outstanding before it is fully extinguished 
while extinguishment may result from exercise  it can also result from cancellation post vesting or expiration at the contractual term 
expected term is an output in lattice models so we do not have to determine this amount 
goodwill and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december for the following years was as follows in millions  and please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed rollforward of our goodwill 
we follow the guidance in statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october of each year 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of october   and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
our estimate of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 
if of the non depreciable assets acquired during were allocated to a depreciable asset with an average life of years  depreciation expense would have increased by approximately million in the purchase price of acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and are subject to change during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date 
fair value estimates are derived from established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for through  our reserves for professional and general liability claims are based upon actuarial calculations completed quarterly  which consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions in actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses that are recorded during a reporting period 
professional judgment is used in each actuarial calculation in determining their balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis professional and general liability claims continued our self insured retention levels ranged from million to million  depending on the state we operate in 
additionally  certain of our facilities operate in states having state specific medical malpractice programs 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have increased in recent years  we have accepted a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december was as follows in millions  and the reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
the total expense for professional and general liability coverage  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows in millions determining reserve estimates  which are discounted to present value using a discount rate 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the amount of medical malpractice awards 
if such laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
we use the actuarial calculations and average the results in determining our recorded reserve levels on a quarterly basis 
this averaging process results in a refined estimation approach that we believe produces a more reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
upon conforming the hospitals that we acquired from province to our methodology for estimating reserves for professional and general liability claims  the reserves for these claims were increased by million 
the impact of this change decreased our diluted earnings per share by for the year ended december  and is included in transaction costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
loss estimates by selecting factors that are considered appropriate for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used in these actuarial calculations with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
we derive our estimates for financial reporting purposes by using a mathematical average of our actuarial results 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
 and our expense for professional and general liability coverage each year includes the actuarially determined estimate of losses for the current year  including claims incurred but not reported  the change in the estimate of losses for prior years based upon actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections  the insurance premiums for losses in excess of our self insured retention levels  the administrative costs of the insurance program and interest expense related to the balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis professional and general liability claims continued discounted portion of the liability 
the expense also includes million of transaction costs recorded to conform the hospitals that we acquired from province to our methodology for determining medical malpractice reserves 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets as of december for the following years were as follows in millions  and our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december for the following years were as follows in millions  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which we adopted on january  we apply the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and follow the guidance on various matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosure 
we elected to continue our historical practice of classifying interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by million as of december   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced federal taxable income 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
however  we do have subsidiaries with a history of tax losses in certain state jurisdictions and  based upon those historical tax losses  we assumed that the subsidiaries would not be profitable in the future for those state s tax purposes 
if our assertion regarding the future profitability of those subsidiaries were incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated by the amount of the valuation allowance of million at december  the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur million of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest 
results of operations the following definitions apply throughout the remaining portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations admissions 
represents the total number of patients admitted in the facility for a period in excess of hours to our hospitals and used by management and investors as a general measure of inpatient volume

salaries and wages increased as a result of an increase in the number of employed physicians and other nursing and clinical personnel 
additionally  we experienced an increase in our average hourly rate as a result of market rate increases for skilled personnel 
this was partially offset by the improvements in our contract labor costs  which decreased during the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase in our stock based compensation is a result of an increase in the number of outstanding unvested stock options and nonvested stock and a change in our forfeiture rate methodology 
we changed from a static forfeiture rate methodology to a dynamic forfeiture rate methodology during the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology incorporates the lapse of time into the resulting expense calculation and results in a forfeiture rate that diminishes as the granted awards approach its vest date 
accordingly  the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results in a more consistent stock compensation expense calculation over the vesting period of the award 
this change in methodology resulted in a higher stock compensation expense during the three months ended december  compared to the same period last year 
our workers compensation expense  which is a part of our employee benefits expense  increased from a credit of million during the three months ended december   to an expense of million during the three months ended december  the million credit recognized during the three months ended december  was the result of favorable loss experience

during  we incurred non deductible compensation relating to the early vesting of nonvested stock awards  for which the tax impact of the non deductible costs was recorded entirely in liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our debt borrowings 
we believe that our internally generated cash flows and amounts available under our debt agreements will be adequate to service existing debt  finance internal growth  expend funds on capital expenditures and fund certain small to mid size hospital acquisitions 
it is not our intent to maintain large cash balances 
the following table presents summarized cash flow information for the years ended december for the periods indicated in millions net cash flows provided by continuing operating activities less purchase of property and equipment free operating cash flow acquisitions  net of cash acquired proceeds from sale of hospitals proceeds from borrowings payments on borrowings proceeds from exercise of stock options proceeds for the completion of a new hospital payment of debt issue costs repurchase of common stock other cash flows from operations provided by used in discontinued operations cash flows from investing activities used in discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the non gaap metric of free operating cash flow is an important liquidity measure for us 
our computation of free operating cash flow consists of net cash flow provided by continuing operations less cash flows used for purchases of property and equipment 
we believe that free operating cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash and is also utilized for debt repayments 
computations of free operating cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  free operating cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the report

convertible senior subordinated debentures due august  on august   we sold million of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due the debentures 
the net proceeds were approximately million and were used to repay indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the debentures bear interest at the rate of per year  payable semi annually on february and august the debentures are convertible subject to certain limitations imposed by the credit agreement under the following circumstances if the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold during the specified periods  if the trading price of the debentures is below a specified threshold  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or if specified corporate transactions or other specified events occur

our ability to pay the principal return in cash is subject to important limitations imposed by the credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur in the future 
based on the terms of the credit agreement  in certain circumstances  even if any of the foregoing conditions to conversion have occurred  the debentures will not be convertible  and holders of the debentures will not be able to declare an event of default under the debentures 
the conversion rate for the debentures is initially shares of our common stock per  principal amount of debentures subject to adjustment in certain events 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of per share of common stock 
in addition  if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control occur on or prior to february   we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances  unless such transaction constitutes a public acquirer change of control and we elect to modify the conversion rate into public acquirer common stock

interest rate swap on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with citibank as counterparty 
the interest rate swap agreement  as amended  was effective as of november  and has a maturity date of may  we entered into the interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the floating interest rate risk on a portion of our outstanding variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate swap agreement requires us to make quarterly fixed rate payments to citibank calculated on a notional amount as set forth in the table below at an annual fixed rate of while citibank will be obligated to make quarterly floating payments to us based on the three month libor on the same referenced notional amount 
notwithstanding the terms of the interest rate swap transaction  we are ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the credit agreement 
notional amount date range in millions november  to november  november  to november  november  to november  november  to november  november  to may  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is the amount at which it could be settled  based on estimates obtained from citibank 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge instrument  which is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value 
we assess the effectiveness of this cash flow hedge instrument on a quarterly basis 
we completed an assessment of the cash flow hedge instrument at quarterly intervals during and determined the hedge to be partially ineffective in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

because the notional amounts of the interest rate swap in effect at the quarterly intervals during exceeded our outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt credit agreement  a portion of the cash flow hedge instrument was determined to be ineffective 
we recognized an increase in interest expense of approximately million related to the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedge during the interest rate swap agreement exposes us to credit risk in the event of non performance by citibank 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by citibank 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the fair value of our interest rate swap at december  reflected a liability of approximately million and is included in professional and general liability claims and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the interest rate swap reflects a liability balance as of december  because of a decrease in market interest rates since inception 
debt ratings our debt is rated by three credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations by the sec moody s investors service  inc moody s  standard poor s rating services  s p  and fitch ratings 
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  based on information provided by us and other sources 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and  therefore  ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
our recent ratings are primarily a reflection of the rating agencies concern regarding our higher leverage  increased activity in acquisitions and our ability to pay down our outstanding debt

we have large projects in process at a number of our facilities 
we are reconfiguring some of our hospitals to more effectively accommodate patient services and restructuring existing surgical capacity in some of our hospitals to permit additional patient volume and a greater variety of services 
at december   we had projects under construction with an estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of required capital expenditures for certain facilities 
we anticipate funding these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  available cash and borrowings available under our credit arrangements 
our business strategy contemplates the selective acquisition of additional hospitals and other healthcare service providers  and we regularly review these potential acquisitions 
these acquisitions may  however  require additional financing 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt or equity for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of outstanding shares of our common stock either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  regulatory constraints and other factors  to utilize excess cash flow after its capital expenditure needs have been satisfied 
we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program 
the program expires on november   but may be extended  suspended or discontinued at any time prior to the expiration date 
we repurchased approximately million shares during for an aggregate purchase price  including commissions  of approximately million with a weighted average purchase price of per share 
we currently anticipate repurchasing most of the million allowed under this program by mid we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and  accordingly  do not currently intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock 
our board of directors will evaluate our future earnings  results of operations  financial condition and capital requirements in determining whether to declare or pay cash dividends 
delaware law prohibits us from paying any dividends unless we have capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose 
in addition  our credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
we believe that cash flows from operations  amounts available under our credit facility and our access to capital markets are sufficient to fund the purchase prices for any potential acquisitions  meet expected liquidity needs  including repayment of our debt obligations  planned capital expenditures and other expected operating needs over the next three years 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are required to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under certain of our operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations b other long term liabilities c purchase obligations d a included in long term debt obligations are principal and interest owed on our outstanding debt obligations  giving consideration to our interest rate swap 
these obligations are explained further in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we used the effective interest rate at december  for our million outstanding term b loans to estimate interest payments on this variable rate debt instrument 
our interest rate swap requires us to make quarterly interest payments at an annual fixed rate of while the counterparty is obligated to make quarterly floating payments to us based on the three month libor on a decreasing notional amount 
our calculation for long term debt obligations includes an estimate for the net result of these payments between us and the counterparty using the difference between our required annual fixed rate of and the three month libor in effect as of december  of based on the effective notional amounts for the indicated period 
holders of our million outstanding debentures may require us to purchase for cash some or all of the debentures on february   february   and february  for purposes of the above table  we assumed that our debentures would be outstanding during its entire term  which ends on august  b this reflects our future minimum operating lease payments 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all of our operating lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information regarding our operating leases 
c our professional and general liability claims and other liabilities balance was million and our long term income tax liability balance was million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the professional and general liability and other liabilities balance reflected a million reserve for professional and general liability claims  an interest rate swap liability balance of million  a million deferred income liability and million related to other liabilities 
the long term income tax liability is a result of our adoption of fin effective january  we excluded the million reserve for professional and general liability claims  the million long term income tax liability and the million of other liabilities because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such amounts 
we excluded both the million deferred income liability and the million interest rate swap liability as they are non cash liabilities

we used a annual rate increase as the estimated consumer price index increase for the contract period 
these fees will increase if we acquire additional hospitals and use hca it for information system conversion services at the acquired hospitals 
f we had projects under construction with an estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately million as of december  because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying a termination fee  these costs are excluded from the above table except for amounts contractually committed by us 
in addition  as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings of this report  we may be required to make significant expenditures in order to bring our facilities into compliance with the ada 
we are currently unable to estimate the costs that could be associated with modifying our facilities because these costs are negotiated and determined on a facility by facility basis and  therefore  have varied and will continue to vary significantly among facilities 
g in consideration for a physician relocating to one of the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective community  we may advance certain amounts of money to a physician  normally over a period of one year  to assist in establishing the physician s practice

segment reporting we have five operating divisions as of december  each of these five operating divisions has similar economic characteristics consisting of acute care hospitals in non urban communities 
we realign these operating divisions frequently based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity 
we consider these five operating divisions as one operating segment  healthcare services  for segment reporting purposes and for goodwill impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we have determined that our five operating divisions comprise one segment because of their similar economic characteristics in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
for the following reasons the treatment of patients in a hospital setting is the only material source of revenues for each of our five operating divisions  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally the same  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally provided to similar types of patients  which is patients in a hospital setting  the healthcare services are primarily provided by the direction of affiliated or employed physicians and by the nurses  lab technicians  and others employed or contracted at each of our hospitals  and the healthcare regulatory environment is generally similar for each of our five operating divisions 
additionally  as discussed in emerging issues task force eitf topic d  clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of fasb statement no 
eitf d  we determined that our five operating divisions comprise one reporting unit because of their similar economic characteristics in each of the following areas the way we manage our operations and extent to which our acquired facilities are integrated into our existing operations as a single reporting unit  our goodwill is recoverable from the collective operations of our five operating divisions and not individually from one single operating division  our operating divisions are frequently realigned based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity  and because of the collective size of our five operating divisions  each division benefits from its participation in a group purchasing organization 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages in marketplaces occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
private insurers pass along their rising costs in the form of lower reimbursement to us 
our ability to pass on these increased costs in increased rates is limited because of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and the fact that the majority of our revenues are fee based 
accordingly  inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk based on changes in interest rates outstanding debt we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we have an interest rate swap to manage our exposure to these fluctuations 
the interest rate swap converts a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a notional amount of million at december  and at an annual fixed rate of
