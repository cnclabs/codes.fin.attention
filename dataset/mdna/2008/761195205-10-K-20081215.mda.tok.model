item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to evaluate  originate  service and manage investment opportunities in the commercial finance  real estate and financial fund management segments 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services  typically under long term management arrangements either through a contract with  or as the manager or general partner of our sponsored fund 
we typically maintain an investment in the funds we sponsor 
we have greatly expanded all three of our reporting segments since assets under management have grown from billion  excluding our former energy subsidiary  at september  to billion at september  we limit our fund development and management services to asset classes in which we have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for our funds 
in our commercial finance operations  we focus on originating small and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial loans secured by business essential equipment  including technology  commercial and industrial equipment and medical equipment 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on the ownership  operation and management of multi family and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  mezzanine loans  investments in distressed real estate loans and investments in value added properties properties which  although not distressed need substantial improvements to reach their full investment potential 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  bank loan and asset backed securities  or abs 
as a specialized asset manager  we are affected by conditions in the financial markets and  in particular  have been affected by the recent volatility and reduction in liquidity in the global credit markets which have reduced the revenues from  and the values of  many of the types of financial assets which we manage or own 
these conditions resulted in our recording the following charges during fiscal a million charge  net of minority interest and tax  to reflect the other than temporary impairment of certain investments in cdos  primarily those with investments in financial institutions and real estate  including rmbs and cmbs  a million charge  net of tax  to reflect losses incurred from the sale of loans being accumulated on warehouse facilities we terminated in as a result of our determination not to proceed with the cdo issuance for which the assets were being accumulated  an aggregate million of charges  net of tax  to reflect our equity impairment charges recognized by the five trapeza partnerships in which we have interests  and a million charge  net of tax  to reflect the provision for credit losses  which impacted our business segments as follows commercial finance million  real estate  and financial fund management million 
principally  as a result of these charges  we recorded a net loss of million in fiscal as compared to net income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
assets under management we increased our assets under management by billion to billion at september  from billion at september  the growth in our assets under management was the result of an increase in the financial fund management assets we manage  principally as the result of the completion of one cdo issuance during the first quarter of fiscal and the assumption of collateral management for five cdo issuers from two unrelated third parties  an increase in real estate assets managed on behalf of rcc  joint ventures and limited partnerships and tic property interests that we sponsor  and an increase in commercial finance assets managed on behalf of the limited partnerships we sponsor  rcc  and for ourselves

certain of these and other factors  including our history of pre tax earnings  are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
we are subject to examination by the us internal revenue service  or irs  and by the taxing authorities in other states in which we have significant business operations  such as pennsylvania and new york

back to index 
back to index cumulative effect of change in accounting principle historically  we presented our equity in the earnings and losses of the trapeza entities on a one quarter lag as permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
improvements in the timeliness and availability of financial data from the trapeza entities allowed us to report our share in the earnings of these entities on a current basis as of october  as a result of this change  our equity in the earnings of the trapeza entities of million  net of tax of  for the three months ended september  has been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a cumulative change in accounting principle as of october  liquidity and capital resources during the past three years  our major sources of liquidity have been capital provided by the resolution of our real estate legacy portfolio  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  capital raised through our specialized asset management funds and sales of shares we held in tbbk 
we have employed these funds principally to expand our specialized asset management operations and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in fiscal  we terminated the two remaining warehouse facilities we were using to fund the accumulation of assets for cdos we sponsored see overview  above and increased the use of our corporate and leaf credit facilities 
for fiscal  we expect to fund our asset management businesses through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations  borrowings on our existing credit facilities  capital raised through our investment funds  and continued monetization of our legacy portfolio 
the following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash in thousands years ended september  provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations used in investing activities of continuing operations provided by financing activities of continuing operations used in provided by discontinued operations net cash retained by entities previously consolidated as an asset management company  our liquidity needs consist principally of capital needed to make investments and to pay our operating expenses  principally wages and benefits for our employees 
our ability to meet our liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from operations  and  with respect to our investments  our ability to raise investor funds and to obtain debt financing 
however  the availability of any such financing will depend on market conditions which  as we discuss in overview  have recently been subject to substantial volatility and reduction in liquidity 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  we may be unable to implement our investment strategies successfully and may be required to liquidate portfolio investments 
if required  a sale of portfolio investments could be at prices lower than the carrying value of such investments  which could result in losses and reduced income 
at september   our liquidity consisted of three primary sources cash of million and restricted cash of million comprised of million related to various escrow balances  principally million held in escrow for apidos cdo vi which we consolidate under fin r  and million in collection accounts related to our commercial finance business  cash generated from operations  including asset and property management fees as well as payments received on leases and loans  including sales of equipment  and financing available includes the following million under two commercial finance credit facilities  net of million utilized  for a net availability of million  which is limited to funding our commercial finance operations and million under two corporate facilities  net of million utilized  for a net available of million  subject to collateral limitations 
as of september   availability was limited to million 
furthermore  on august  and september   our corporate revolving credit facility with td bank was amended to reduce the minimum net worth covenant 
in consideration for the amendment  we and td bank agreed to reduce the outstanding commitment of million on september   to million on december  and to million on march  additionally  during fiscal  the resolution of our legacy portfolio provided million of cash 
our legacy portfolio at september   consists of eight loans and five property interests with an aggregate face value net of third party liens of million 
because of current economic conditions  the amount of cash we may be able to derive from resolution of our legacy portfolio in the future may be limited  in any event  the amount of cash we derive from it has been subject to significant variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our legacy portfolio will be a source of significant on going cash generation in the future 

back to index 
back to index cash retained by entities previously consolidated 
as of september   we ceased to consolidate two affiliated partnerships that invest in regional banks due to a change in the rights of the limited partners to remove us as the general partner 
accordingly  the statement of cash flows for fiscal reflects the million decrease in cash from these entities that had been previously consolidated 
capital requirements our capital needs consist principally of funds to make investments in the investment vehicles we sponsor or for our own account and to provide bridge financing or other temporary financial support to facilitate asset acquisitions by our sponsored investment vehicles 
accordingly  the amount of capital we require will depend to a significant extent upon our level of activity in making investments for our own account or in sponsoring investment vehicles  all of which is largely within our discretion 
dividends in the fiscal years ended september   and  we paid cash dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
we have paid quarterly cash dividends since august the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  is at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting our financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations other debt capital lease obligations secured credit facilities operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations not included in the table above are estimated interest payments calculated at rates in effect at september   less than year million  years million  years million  and after years million

amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments guarantees standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments senior lien financing with respect to acquired properties  tic investment programs and real estate loans is typically obtained on a non recourse basis  with the lender s remedies limited to the properties securing the senior lien financing 
although non recourse in nature  these loans are subject to limited standard exceptions  which we have guaranteed  or carveouts 
these carveouts relate to a total of million in financing and expire as the related indebtedness is paid down over the next ten years 
as of september   except for the clawback liability recorded for the trapeza entities  we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our indemnifications and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
financial fund management clawbacks two of the trapeza entities have incentive distributions carried interest that are subject to a potential clawback to the extent that such distributions exceed cumulative net profits  as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
as of september   our total potential clawback obligation of million has been recorded and is reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 

back to index 
back to index real estate capital improvements and other guarantees we entered into a master lease agreement with one of the tic programs we sponsored and manage 
this agreement requires us to fund up to million for capital improvements for the tic property over the next years 
to date  we have funded approximately  of required capital improvements 
in connection with the sale of a real estate loan in march  we agreed that in exchange for the current property owner relinquishing certain control rights  we would make payments to the current property owner under stipulated circumstances  including the sale or foreclosure of the property or a subsequent resale of the loan 
a payment of million  increasing  per month to a maximum of million  would be due upon the occurrence of specified events 
in addition  the current property owner has the right to receive collateral as security for this obligation equal to or greater than of the value of the obligation upon the occurrence of specified events or if our net worth falls below million 
our obligation runs through december  in addition  we have agreed to partially indemnify the purchaser of the loan for a portion of the difference between ordinary income tax rates and capital gain rates on accrued interest on the note between the date of sale of the loan in march and december  we guarantee one of our real estate partners against any losses  costs or damages that it may incur due to any fraud  bankruptcy  material misrepresentation or limited other intentional bad acts by us 
the guarantee terminates upon the earlier occurrence of i either we or our partner ceases to be member of such partnership or ii termination of the operating agreement of the partnership 
our maximum liability on the guarantee is million 
commitments as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
we make these investments on a periodic basis as the investment funds obtain investment capital 
we are a party to employment agreements with certain of our employees that provide for compensation and other benefits 
the agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances 
at september   we had unfunded commitments of million relating to three separate loans in the apidos cdo vi portfolio 
these unfunded commitments are specifically reserved for in restricted cash 
legal proceedings we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
management believes that none of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and cost and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the provision for credit losses  deferred tax assets and liabilities  identifiable intangible assets  guarantees and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
employee stock options we follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r  share based payment  or sfas r  as revised 
accordingly  we expense employee stock option grants over their respective vesting periods  based on the estimated fair value of each award as determined on the date of grant 

back to index 
back to index loans purchased at a discount we hold two real estate loans that we acquired at a discount due to credit quality  and account for these loans in accordance with the provisions of american institue of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  we accrete the difference between our cost basis and the sum of projected cash flows from our loans into interest income over the estimated life of the loan using the effective interest method 
we review projected cash flows  which include amounts realizable from the underlying properties  on a regular basis 
changes to projected cash flows  which can be based upon updated property appraisals  changes to the property and changes to the real estate market in general  reduce or increase the amounts accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
we also use the cost recovery method for loans when appropriate under the circumstances 
direct financing leases we account for some of our lease transactions as direct financing leases as distinguished from operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
our investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of the total future minimum contracted payments receivable and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased equipment  less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which we recognize as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value we expect to realize at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
we capitalize initial direct costs incurred in the consummation of the lease as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortize them over the lease term as a reduction of the yield 
operating leases we deem leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases to be operating leases 
under the accounting for operating leases  we record the cost of the leased equipment  including acquisition fees associated with lease placements  as an asset and depreciate it on a straight line basis over the equipment s estimated useful life  generally up to seven years 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rental payments due under the terms of the leases 
we recognize rental income on a straight line basis 
generally  during the lease terms of existing operating leases  we will not recover all of the cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  we are prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review  on at least a quarterly basis  the expected economic life of our rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of our undepreciated cost 
we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that our carrying amount exceeds such value and we can reasonably estimate the excess 
we recognize gains only upon actual sale of the rental equipment 
there were no write downs of equipment during fiscal  and real estate loans an impaired real estate loan may remain on accrual status during the period in which we pursue repayment of the loan  however  we place the loan on non accrual status at such time as either management believes that contractual debt service payments will not be met  the loan becomes days delinquent  management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of the impairment  or of the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value of such loan 
while on non accrual status  we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received 
allowance for credit losses loans held for investment 
we generally evaluate loans held for investment for impairment individually  but we may evaluate loans purchased on a pooled basis with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics collectively for impairment 
loans held for investment are separated into four categories for evaluation of impairment 
category contains loans that have defaulted or are expected to default imminently 
these loans require a specific impairment and are placed on non accrual status until the situation materially changes 
category contains loans where nearer term liquidity concerns exist as to the collectability of all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  but no certainty as to which  if any  loans will default 
we apply a general reserve for these loans with an assumed recovery rate of 
category contains loans that show some liquidity concerns but the probability for estimated potential defaults is not quantifiable  therefore  no reserve is established 
category contains loans that show remote signs of liquidity concerns and  therefore  no reserve is established 
when a loan is impaired  we increase the allowance for credit losses by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value 
we may determine fair value based on a market price  if available  b the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs  or c the present value of estimated cash flows 
we recognize increases in the allowance for credit losses in our statements of operations as a provision for credit losses 
when we consider a loan  or a portion thereof  uncollectible and that pursuit of the collection is not warranted  then we will record a charge off or write down of the loan against the allowance for loan losses 

back to index 
back to index commercial finance assets 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses in commercial finance including investments in leases  loans and future payment card receivables based upon  among other factors  management s historical experience on equipment finance portfolios it manages  an analysis of contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics and equipment finance portfolio characteristics  adjusted for expected recoveries 
in evaluating historic performance  we perform a migration analysis  which estimates the likelihood that an account will progress through delinquency stages to ultimate write off 
our policy is to charge off to the allowance those financings which are in default and for which management has determined the probability of collection to be remote 
real estate loans and real estate 
we consider general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  casualty losses and other factors that may affect the value of real estate loans and real estate included in investments in real estate in the consolidated balance sheets 
the value of loans and real estate may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
in addition  we continuously monitor collections and payments from our borrowers and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon our historical experience and our knowledge of specific borrower collection issues 
we reduce our investments in real estate loans and real estate by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
such allowance can be either specific to a particular loan or property or general to all loans and real estate 
investment securities available for sale we account for our investments in affiliates  financial fund management entities and other marketable securities in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investment securities in affiliates include our holdings in tbbk and rcc 
investments in financial fund management entities include our direct investments in cdos we sponsor as well as our indirect holdings in cdos through our consolidation of the structured finance funds  or the sff entities 
we classify these investment securities as available for sale and  as such  carry them at fair value 
our investments in rcc and tbbk are valued at the closing price of the respective stock on the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the cdo investments is based primarily on internally generated expected cash flow models that require significant management judgment and estimation due to the lack of market activity and unobservable pricing inputs 
we report cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we determine realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities on the basis of specific identification and include them in net income 
periodically  we review the carrying value of our available for sale securities 
if we deem an unrealized loss to be other than temporarily impaired  we will record an impairment charge 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  and v our intent and ability to hold the investment until the value recovers 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we write down the cost of the investment to fair value 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification 
we account for our interests in cdos in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
in accordance with eitf  an other than temporary impairment has occurred when we determine that adverse changes in estimated cash flows have occurred as a result of declining net spread  prepayments or credit loss experience 
accordingly  we write down the security to fair value  and transfer the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded as a reduction of current earnings 
we recover the cost basis adjustment for an other than temporary impairment only upon the sale or maturity of the security 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
we test for impairment of goodwill as of may st each year 
additionally  on an interim basis  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if an impairment exists  a write down to fair value normally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows is recorded 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized primarily on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that an asset s estimated future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge may be required to reduce the carrying amount for that asset to its estimated fair value

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  prior to our application of the guidance in sab  we used the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements and concluded that they were immaterial individually and in the aggregate 
with sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
we elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and recorded an adjustment of  to retained earnings on october  the increase consisted of a decrease of  to salary expense to correct our accounting practice for recording incentive compensation for employees  an increase of  to salary expense to correct the method used to record pension liability adjustments for the supplemental employee retirement plan  or serp  and an increase of  to interest expense to adjust the amount of interest owed on a mortgage loan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the following discussion is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonable credit losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
the following analyzes the potential impact on our earnings  cash flows and financial position from a hypothetical change in market risk factors as of september  our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
commercial finance we hold commercial finance assets for sale which are comprised of loans and leases at fixed rates of interest 
these assets are generally sold to our leasing investment partnerships at fair value  generally within three months from the date acquired 
accordingly  our exposure to changes in market interest rates on these assets is minimized 
to finance these assets  we have a million variable rate revolving warehouse credit facility with a group of banks led by national city bank  which had an outstanding balance of million at september  interest is charged at one of two rates i libor plus  or ii the prime rate 
we have entered into a million interest rate swap agreement in order to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in libor on this facility 
a hypothetical change in libor for the portion that is not covered by the interest rate swaps would change our annual interest expense by  we hold additional commercial finance assets for investment  comprised of loans  leases and future credit card receivables at fixed rates of interest 
to finance these assets  we have a million variable rate secured revolving credit facility with morgan stanley  which had an outstanding balance of million at september  interest on the facility is equal to one month libor plus 
this facility is not subject to fluctuation in interest rates because we have entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements which create a fixed interest rate on the entire balance 
the  fair value of the interest rate cap agreements is reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at september  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would cause this asset to increase in value by  and a decrease in the interest rate would cause a  decrease in its value 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps agreements was million at september  and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase the value of these agreements  and correspondingly reduce the liability balance  by million 
a decrease in the interest rate would decrease the value of the swap agreements  and correspondingly increase the liability balance  by million

back to index real estate portfolio loans and related senior liens 
as of september   we believe that none of the three loans held in our portfolio that have senior liens are sensitive to changes in interest rates since the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and therefore are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  the senior lien interests ahead of our interests are at fixed rates and are not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flows were to exceed the interest due  as originally underwritten 
other loans 
a mortgage that we consolidate at september  as a result of fin r is at a fixed interest rate and  therefore  not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
financial fund management our investment in apidos cdo vi is subject to variable interest rates that are indexed to libor 
because the loans and notes held by apidos cdo vi are short term in nature  we are not subject to material exposure to movements in fair value as a result of a change in interest rates 
other at september   we had two secured revolving credit facilities for general business use 
weighted average borrowings on these two facilities were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on these facilities would change our annual interest expense by
