item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors beginning on page of this report 
overview we operate multi use sports and athletic  professional fitness  family recreation and resort spa centers 
as of february   we operated centers primarily in residential locations across states under the life time fitness brand 
we commenced operations in by opening centers in the minneapolis and st 
paul  minnesota area 
during this period of initial growth  we refined the format and model of our center while building our membership base  infrastructure and management team 
as a result  several of the centers that opened during our early years have designs that differ from our current model center 
we compare the results of our centers based on how long the centers have been open at the most recent measurement period 
we include a center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month of the center s operation  prior to which time we refer to the center as a new center 
we include an acquired center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after we assumed the center s operations 
as we grow our presence in existing markets by opening new centers  we expect to attract some memberships away from our other existing centers already in those markets  reducing revenue and initially lowering the memberships of those existing centers 
in addition  as a result of new center openings in existing markets  and because older centers will represent an increasing proportion of our center base over time  our comparable center revenue may be lower in future periods than in the past 
of the eleven new centers we plan to open in  we expect that eight will be in existing markets 

table of contents we do not expect that operating costs of our planned new centers will be significantly higher than centers opened in the past  and we also do not expect that the planned increase in the number of centers will have a material adverse effect on the overall financial condition or results of operations of existing centers 
another result of opening new centers  as well as the assumption of operations of seven leased facilities in and the assumption of operations of one leased facility in  is that our center operating margins may be lower than they have been historically while the centers build membership base 
we expect both the addition of pre opening expenses and the lower revenue volumes characteristic of newly opened centers  as well as the facility costs for the eight leased centers  to affect our center operating margins at these new centers and on a consolidated basis 
our categories of new centers and existing centers do not include the center owned by bloomingdale llc because it is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as average revenue per membership  including membership dues and enrollment fees  average in center revenue per membership and center operating expenses  with an emphasis on payroll and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales and comparable center revenue growth 
we use center revenue and ebitda margins to evaluate overall performance and profitability on an individual center basis 
in addition  we focus on several membership statistics on a center level and system wide basis 
these metrics include growth of center membership levels and growth of system wide memberships  percentage center membership to target capacity  center membership usage  center membership mix among individual  couple and family memberships and center attrition rates 
we have three primary sources of revenue 
first  our largest source of revenue is membership dues and enrollment fees paid by our members 
we recognize revenue from monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we recognize revenue from enrollment fees over the expected average life of the membership  which we estimate to be months 
second  we generate revenue within a center  which we refer to as in center revenue  or in center businesses  including fees for personal training  dieticians  group fitness training and other member activities  sales of products at our lifecafe  sales of products and services offered at our lifespa  tennis programs and renting space in certain of our centers 
and third  we have expanded the life time fitness brand into other wellness related offerings that generate revenue  which we refer to as other revenue  or corporate businesses  including our media  athletic events and nutritional product businesses 
our primary media offering is our magazine  experience life 
other revenue also includes our two restaurants and rental income on our highland park  minnesota office building 
center operations expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs  utilities  repairs and maintenance  supplies  administrative support and communications to operate our centers 
advertising and marketing expenses consist of our marketing department costs and media and advertising costs to support center membership levels  in center businesses and our corporate businesses 
general and administrative expenses include costs relating to our centralized support functions  such as accounting  information systems  procurement  real estate and development and member relations 
our other operating expenses include the costs associated with our media  athletic events and nutritional product businesses  our two restaurants and other corporate expenses  as well as gains or losses on our dispositions of assets 
our total operating expenses may vary from period to period depending on the number of new centers opened during that period  the number of centers engaged in presale activities and the performance of the in center businesses 
our primary capital expenditures relate to the construction of new centers and updating and maintaining our existing centers 
the land acquisition  construction and equipment costs for a current model center since inception in  has ranged from approximately to million  and can vary considerably based on variability in land cost and the cost of construction labor  as well as whether or not a tennis area is included or whether or not we expand the gymnasium or add other facilities 
the average cost for the current model centers opened in was approximately million 
we perform maintenance and make improvements on our centers and equipment throughout each year 
we conduct a more thorough remodeling project at each center approximately every four to six years 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
ultimate results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives  volatility factors  expected lives and rate of return in determining fair value of option grants  tax provisions and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
we also use estimates for calculating the amortization period for deferred enrollment fee revenue and associated direct costs  which are based on the historical average expected life of center memberships 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition 
we receive a one time enrollment fee at the time a member joins and monthly membership dues for usage from our members 
the enrollment fees are non refundable after days 
enrollment fees and related direct expenses  primarily sales commissions  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over an estimated membership period of months  which is based on historical membership experience 
we review the estimated membership period on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances change 
changes in member behavior  competition  economic conditions and our performance may cause attrition levels to change  which could impact the average estimated membership period 
in the event the estimated membership period was months for instead of months  the impact would be an increase in net income of less than million 
in the event the estimated membership period was months for instead of months  the impact would be a decrease in net income of less than million 
over the last seven years  the estimated membership period has never fallen outside of the range of to months 
monthly membership dues paid in advance of a center opening are deferred until the center opens 
we only offer members month to month memberships and recognize as revenue the monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we provide services at each of our centers  including personal training  lifespa  lifecafe and other member services 
the revenue associated with these services is recognized at the time the service is performed 
personal training revenue received in advance of training sessions and the related commissions are deferred and recognized when services are performed 
other revenue  which includes revenue generated primarily from our media  athletic events and restaurant  is recognized when realized and earned 
media advertising revenue is recognized over the duration of the advertising placement 
for athletic events  revenue is generated primarily through sponsorship sales and registration fees 
athletic event revenue is recognized upon the completion of the event 
in limited instances in our media and athletic events businesses  we recognize revenue on barter transactions 
we recognize barter revenue equal to the lesser of the value of the advertising or promotion given up or the value of the asset received 
restaurant revenue is recognized at the point of sale to the customer 
pre opening operations 
we generally operate a preview center up to nine months prior to the planned opening of a center during which time memberships are sold as construction of the center is completed 
the revenue and direct membership acquisition costs  primarily sales commissions  incurred during the period prior to a center opening are deferred until the center opens and are then recognized on a straight line basis over a period of months beginning when the center opens  however  all other costs  including advertising  office and rent expenses incurred during this period  are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
we consider a history of consistent and significant operating losses to be our primary indicator of potential impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at an individual center or corporate business level 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that center or corporate business  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value

the terms of the relationship among the members are governed by an operating agreement  referred to as the operating agreement  which expires on the earlier of december or the liquidation of bloomingdale llc 
in december  bloomingdale llc entered into a management agreement with us  pursuant to which we agreed to manage the day to day operations of the center  subject to the overall supervision by the management committee of bloomingdale llc  which is comprised of six members  two from each of the three members of the joint venture 
we have no unilateral control of the center  as all decisions essential to the accomplishments of the purpose of the joint venture require the approval of a majority of the members 
bloomingdale llc is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
additional details related to our interest in bloomingdale llc are provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda and ebitda margin as measures of operating performance 
ebitda should not be considered as a substitute for net income  cash flows provided by operating activities  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
the funds depicted by ebitda are not necessarily available for discretionary use if they are reserved for particular capital purposes  to maintain compliance with debt covenants  to service debt or to pay taxes 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service its debt and we are required to comply with certain covenants and borrowing limitations that are based on variations of ebitda in certain of our financing documents  and it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same consistent measurement basis of operating performance used by management  and as the basis for incentive bonuses paid to selected members of senior and center level management 
we have provided reconciliations of ebitda to net income in the section quarterly results unaudited  located immediately following the report of independent registered public accounting firm 

table of contents seasonality of business seasonal trends have a limited effect on our overall business 
generally  we have experienced greater membership growth at the beginning of the year and we have not experienced an increased rate of membership attrition during any particular season of the year 
during the summer months  we have experienced a slight increase in operating expenses due to our outdoor aquatics operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through various debt arrangements  sales of equity and cash provided by operations 
principal liquidity needs have included the development of new centers  debt service requirements and expenditures necessary to maintain and update our existing centers and their related fitness equipment 
we believe that we can satisfy our current and longer term debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements with cash flow from operations  by the extension of the terms of or refinancing our existing debt facilities  through sale leaseback transactions and by continuing to raise long term debt or equity capital  although there can be no assurance that such actions can or will be completed 
our business model operates with negative working capital because we carry minimal accounts receivable due to our ability to have monthly membership dues paid by electronic draft  we defer enrollment fee revenue and we fund the construction of our new centers under standard arrangements with our vendors that are paid with proceeds from long term debt 
operating activities as of december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million and million of restricted cash that serves as collateral for certain of our debt arrangements 
we also had million available under the terms of our revolving credit facility as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for  driven primarily by a million  or  improvement in net income 
historically  our operating cash flow has been in line with our ebitda growth rate 
in  however  we experienced a divergence of these rates as operating cash flow grew by and ebitda grew by 
the primary reason for this change is the impact our working capital had on overall operating cash flows  as we experienced approximately million less of changes in operating assets and liabilities in than in drivers of this include a million reduction in income taxes receivable due to greater tax payments made during as compared to  a million increase in other current assets due to land held for sale  an increase of million in accounts receivable due to growth in our corporate businesses and a million increase in inventories due to in center business growth 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for  driven primarily by a million or  improvement in net income 
investing activities investing activities consist primarily of purchasing real property  constructing new centers and purchasing new fitness equipment 
in addition  we invest in capital expenditures to maintain and update our existing centers 
we finance the purchase of our property and equipment by cash payments or by financing through notes payable or capital lease obligations 
for current model centers  our investment  through  has ranged from approximately to million  which includes the land  the building and approximately million of exercise equipment  furniture and fixtures 
we expect the average cost of new centers constructed in to be approximately million  reflecting location costs and the new story centers set to open

fin obligations represent uncertain tax positions 
in addition to the other long term liabilities presented in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fin which clarifies the application of sfas no 
by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements

fin was effective for us on january  for more information on the adoption of fin  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this accounting standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements with certain exceptions 
sfas was effective for us january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this accounting standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
we currently do not plan to adopt any of the provisions of sfas in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas r 
this accounting standard requires an acquirer to recognize and measure the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exception

these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes

as of december   our net floating rate indebtedness was approximately million 
if long term floating interest rates were to have increased by basis points during the year ended december   our interest costs would have increased by approximately million
