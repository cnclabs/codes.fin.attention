item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  operating profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue in was billion compared with billion in this increase is primarily the result of the percent higher volume of work performed in the oil gas segment in compared with the company believes that high demand in the global oil and gas industry is driving a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years 
in addition  revenue increased in the industrial infrastructure  global services and power segments while the government segment experienced a significant decline in revenue in compared with the revenue decline in the government segment was primarily due to the substantial completion of environmental work on a large department of energy doe project and hurricane relief efforts for the federal emergency management agency fema in and lower embassy and iraq construction work in revenue in the power segment in increased significantly compared with primarily due to work on a coal fired power plant in texas that was released for full execution in the company believes that the power market is entering an expansion phase due to higher demand for power generation facilities 
consolidated revenue in increased by percent compared with this increase was the primary result of higher project execution activities in the oil gas  global services and power segments and work performed for support of fema for hurricane relief efforts that started in earnings before taxes were million in  million in and million in earnings before taxes for increased by percent compared with primarily from the percent overall improvement in business segment operating profit and a significant increase in net interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates in all business segments  except government  had improvements in operating profit primarily due to increases in revenue from work performed 
operating profit in the government segment improved primarily due to the absence of charges associated with embassy projects which significantly impacted results in as discussed below 
incentive and stock price based compensation expense  that is included in corporate administrative and general expense  was higher in compared with and earnings before taxes for increased by percent compared with the oil gas and global services segments reported higher operating profit benefiting from favorable conditions in oil and gas markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment returned to profitability in on improved project execution performance and the absence of provisions required in on certain projects in dispute resolution 
partially offsetting these operating profit improvements during was significantly lower operating profit from the government segment 
operating profit was reduced primarily due to provisions totaling million on fixed price projects in the government segment which largely offset earnings from hurricane relief work for fema 
the provisions were for losses on certain fixed price embassy projects totaling million and the balance for the air base project in afghanistan due to difficulties with a subcontractor 
see further discussion of the embassy and afghanistan provisions under government below 
the effective tax rate for was percent which includes the impact of the final resolution with the us internal revenue service irs of a tax audit relating to tax years through the reduction in tax expense associated with the settlement totaled million 
the settlement lowered the effective tax rate for by percentage points 
the effective rate compares with effective rates of percent and percent for and  respectively 
variability in effective tax rates in recent years and further discussion of the settlement with the irs are discussed below under corporate  tax and other matters 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared with per share in and per share in the significant increase in earnings per share includes the impact of the million per share settlement with the irs discussed above 
thus  earnings per share increased percent in excluding the impact of the settlement compared with consolidated new awards for were billion  compared with billion in  and billion in the oil gas  global services and power segments had increases in new awards during  partially offset by decreases in new awards in the industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments had increases in new awards during  partially offset by lower new awards in the global services  government and power segments 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 
consolidated backlog at december  of billion has more than doubled over the last two years due to strong demand for capital investment in oil gas markets and large awards in industrial infrastructure and power 
as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog relates to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate and tax matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared with total estimated contract cost 
this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog is cost reimbursable while percent is for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  deferrals and revised project scope and cost  both upward and downward 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue  cost and operating profit in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
frequently  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards  and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries  certain reserves on investments  and certain foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
in the first quarter of  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with sfas the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
also  the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the adoption of fin  the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties and reducing the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption  including the impact of recognizing the increase in liability noted above  the company s unrecognized tax benefits totaled million of which million  if recognized  would affect the company s effective tax rate 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
as of december   the accrual totaled million for the potential payment of interest and penalties 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is expected to satisfy the minimum funding requirement 
if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
this statement amends sfas and requires that the funded status of plans  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the pension benefit obligations  be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic pension expense 
the statement was adopted in and resulted in a million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which reduced shareholders equity 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance epcm and is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides design  engineering  procurement  construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides design  engineering  procurement and construction professional services for transportation projects  mining  life sciences facilities  telecommunications projects  manufacturing facilities  commercial and institutional  microelectronics and healthcare facilities 
the government segment provides engineering  construction  contingency response  management and operations services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance activities  small capital project engineering and execution  site equipment and tool services  industrial fleet outsourcing  plant turnaround services  temporary staffing and materials and subcontract procurement 
the power segment provides professional services to the gas fueled  solid fueled  renewables  nuclear and plant betterment marketplaces 
oil gas revenue and operating profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue    operating profit revenue in compared with and has increased substantially as a result of higher levels of project execution activities from the significant levels of new project awards experienced over the last three years 
operating profit margin in the oil gas segment was percent in compared with percent in and percent in the operating margin in includes the impact of a higher volume of lower margin construction related activities as a number of large projects have moved from the engineering phase into on site execution 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in the world wide demand for oil and gas exploration and expansion of refining capacity continues at a high level 
the segment is participating in this expanding market that includes very large projects in diverse geographical locations  which are very well suited for fluor s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
new project awards in included a billion award for the utility and offsite facilities for a new refinery in the middle east and refinery expansion projects in spain and the united states amounting to billion and billion  respectively 
new project awards in included a billion refinery expansion in the united states  a billion project in saudi arabia and a project in excess of billion in qatar 
new project awards in included billion for two large international petrochemical projects and billion for a gas complex in the united arab emirates 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion at december   up sequentially from billion at december  and billion at december  the and growth in backlog results principally from the continued strength of new awards and positive project scope related cost adjustments to existing projects 
total assets in the oil gas segment increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  primarily due to the continued increase in the level of project execution activities over the periods 
industrial infrastructure revenue and operating profit for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue    operating profit revenue increased during compared with primarily as a result of continued strong execution activities on mining and infrastructure projects 
although revenue remained fairly constant for and  the mix of new business in shifted somewhat from manufacturing facilities to large infrastructure and mining projects that generally have longer execution periods 
operating profit and margin percentages have increased during compared with  largely on the strength of performance on mining and infrastructure projects 
the improvement during compared with includes the favorable impacts of successful project performance  reduced provisions on disputed projects  improved margins on more recent projects and overhead spending reductions 
operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects 
the segment participates in a joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
the project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays  resulting in additional cost 
during  and  provisions of million  million and million  respectively  were recorded due to increasing estimated cost 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost  as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project 
to date  the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately million to the client 
cost of million has been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of december  and the company has recognized its million proportionate share of this cost in revenue including million in the project opened to traffic in november and is expected to be completed in mid during  the customer withheld liquidated damages totaling million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture 
the company believes that any amounts that are withheld for liquidated damages will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has therefore not recognized any reduction in project revenue because of the withholdings 
in addition to the charge in arising from the transportation infrastructure project discussed above  the segment recorded provisions totaling million involving several other projects which contributed to the operating loss in that year 
the provisions recognized included settlements involving projects that had been the subject of dispute resolution activities including two resort hotel projects and two life sciences projects 
the projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company 
dispute resolution activities were concluded on these matters and settlements finalized during the company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its london connect project  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the london underground system 
the company has recognized million in and an aggregate of million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to delay and disruption claims that are the subject of the arbitration proceedings 
in addition  the company was assessed and has paid million representing its share of liquidated damages 
this payment has not been recognized as a reduction in project revenue because it is expected that amounts assessed will be substantially recovered upon resolution of the company s claims 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion in and billion during new awards during continued to be concentrated in the mining sector and also included a billion transportation infrastructure project in virginia 
new awards during increased across most of the segment s business lines  with new mining projects representing approximately percent of the total 
the lower level of new awards in included the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards 
backlog for the industrial infrastructure segment increased to billion at the end of from billion at the end of for  ending backlog was billion 
total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in total assets from to is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the national roads telecommunication services project in the united kingdom 
see variable interest entities below for further discussion of this project 
government revenue and operating profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue    operating profit revenue in the last three years includes reconstruction activity in iraq and work for environmental restoration  engineering  construction  site operations and maintenance services at two major doe sites the fernald environmental management project fernald in ohio  which was completed in  and the ongoing hanford environmental management project in washington 
revenue during and also includes significant amounts relating to hurricane relief activities in support of the federal emergency management agency fema 
as expected  a substantial decrease in revenue occurred in compared with the decrease was primarily the result of the significant contributions from fema hurricane relief and the fernald environmental project during the period 
the fernald contract is substantially complete and the volume of fema task orders was significantly lower in and the second half of work in iraq was also lower in the six percent increase in revenue in compared with resulted from the continuation of hurricane relief activities in support of fema  which commenced in the second half of  partially offset by reduced iraq reconstruction and doe project activity 
the level of fema activity increased during early  but began to decline in the third and fourth quarters of the year  as the company s work on hurricane relief efforts was completed 
the decline in doe activity resulted largely from the completion of the fernald project at the end of october operating profit during and include provisions totaling million and million  respectively  on a fixed priced contract at the bagram air base in afghanistan 
these charges relate to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion 
in addition  operating profit in was negatively impacted by loss provisions totaling million on certain embassy projects 
the company recognized provisions for estimated cost overruns on certain of the embassy projects totaling million in the company has been performing work on embassy projects over the last four years for the united states department of state under fixed price contracts 
these projects have been adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions  scope changes causing material deviations from the standard embassy design  increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
as of december   all embassy projects were complete with the exception of the project in haiti where periods of civil unrest have resulted in significant unanticipated schedule delays and cost increases 
in addition  at the site in haiti  increased cost has resulted from collapsible soil conditions  additional client imposed requirements  subsequent increases in material quantities and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
as of december   the physical completion of the haiti embassy has progressed to approximately percent and is estimated to be completed in early during  claims for recovery of cost associated with requirements for additional security cleared labor on three of the embassies were settled 
claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified to date on three of the projects remain open and total approximately million 
as the first formal step in dispute resolution  the majority of these claims have now been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements 
as of december   aggregate cost totaling million relating to these claims has been incurred and recognized in revenue 
additional claims continue to be evaluated 
new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared with billion during and billion in backlog and new awards in do not include amounts for the logistics augmentation program logcap iv contract  awarded in the second quarter  pending resolution of protest proceedings and subsequent award of task orders 
the decrease in new awards in was due to the significant decrease in emergency response work for fema and reconstruction activities in iraq 
many projects performed on behalf of us government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months for annually funded contracts 
backlog during decreased to million from million in and billion in the decline in backlog in compared to is the result of progress towards completion on the fernald and iraq contracts 
fema awards have generally been performed very quickly and therefore have not significantly impacted backlog from one period to the next 
the company is no longer pursuing projects in the embassy market 
total assets in the government segment were million at december   down from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the billing and collection of substantially all of the previously unbilled fees on the fernald project and progress towards completion on the fema and iraq reconstruction contracts 
during  segment assets decreased from million at december  this decrease was the principal result of progress towards completion on the fema and iraq reconstruction contracts 
global services revenue and operating profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue    operating profit the and increases in revenue reflect continued growth across the segment s various service lines 
the segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models 
operating profit increases for and reflect the strong business environment extending across most of global services markets 
additionally  in  operating profit was favorably impacted by hurricane recovery activities 
operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and respectively 
the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue 
accordingly  new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only 
in recent years  global services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from short duration operations and maintenance activities and from other business not reported in backlog 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  billion during and billion during new awards during include new work and renewals for key clients 
new awards in included two large multi year operations and maintenance awards 
backlog for the global services segment was billion at december  during  backlog for the global services segment declined to billion  compared with billion at the end of contributing to the backlog decline was the execution in of a substantial portion of a fixed duration contract 
total assets in the global services segment increased to million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  as the principal result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth 
power revenue and operating profit for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue  operating profit revenue in increased compared to and primarily due to higher volume of work performed on a new project awarded in and continuing activities on projects awarded in and revenue levels in and were negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in operating profit margin in the power segment increased to percent during from percent during the increase in operating profit is the result of higher levels of project execution activities 
the lower operating profit was the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of a project dispute  a loss on another project  a concentration of projects that were in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market 
the operating results include the negative impact of a loss on one project  partly offset by successful project close out activities on a number of other projects 
projects in the power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution  but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
the power market is entering an expansion phase that the company believes will translate to higher operating performance for the segment 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount  but occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of billion in include a billion award for the oak grove coal fired power units in texas for luminant  a unit of energy future holdings corporation 
new awards of million during included a plant retrofit project in south carolina 
new awards of billion during included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in kentucky and a megawatt power plant in nevada 
backlog for the power segment increased to billion at december  from billion at december  and from billion at december   reflecting growth in the number of projects in progress 
total assets in the power segment increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december   due to additional working capital associated with the higher level of project execution activities 
corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   corporate administrative and general expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to higher incentive and stock price based compensation cost as a result of the increase in the company s stock price 
corporate administrative and general expense includes non operating income of million during  non operating expense of million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during and non operating income of million for the year the amount relates primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties including the corporate headquarters building discussed below 
the increase in corporate administrative and general expense includes million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard compared with additionally  during  expenses recorded with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters increased by million 
in may  the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from southern california to the dallas fort worth metropolitan area 
the relocation was completed in the second quarter of approximately employees in southern california who did not relocate to texas left the company 
the cost of these employee displacements was accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of through the date of the employee departures 
all other relocation and hiring cost was charged to expense as incurred 
total relocation cost included in corporate administrative and general expense was million and million during and  respectively 
the corporate facility in california was sold in the cost to construct the new texas headquarters totaled million and was funded from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the former headquarters facility 
net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income significantly increased in primarily as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates during the year 
the decrease was the net result of interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of that were required to support project execution activities  an increase in the interest rates on those commercial paper borrowings and the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt starting in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by higher cash balances and investment interest rates during the second half of higher interest income in related principally to larger available cash balances and higher short term interest rates 
tax the effective tax rates on the company s pretax earnings were percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
in connection with the irs examination of the company s income tax returns for the tax years beginning november  through december   the irs proposed numerous adjustments that  if sustained  would have resulted in significant additional taxes and penalties 
the company filed protests with irs appeals contesting many of the proposed adjustments and reached an agreement with irs appeals  which was reviewed and approved in december by the congressional joint committee on taxation 
as a result of the irs appeals settlement  the company recognized a million reduction to income tax expense in the effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of associated tax benefits  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes 
the comparatively low tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement for the through tax years with the internal revenue service  tax benefits associated with the dividends made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the ajca as more fully discussed below and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns 
these items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in addition  the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit 
these aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely 
during  the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan 
accordingly  the tax rate reflects the us tax effect on these earnings 
the ajca created a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an percent dividends received deduction  subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations 
in august  the company s domestic reinvestment plan the plan prepared pursuant to the ajca was approved by the company s chief executive officer 
the plan was ratified by the executive committee of the company s board of directors on august  in september  approximately million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company  including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the ajca 
the results of operations for included a tax benefit of million attributable to the dividends received deduction  net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction 
litigation and matters in dispute resolution conex international v 
fluor enterprises  inc in november  a jefferson county  texas  jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of conex international conex v 
fluor enterprises inc fei  ruling in favor of conex and awarding million in damages related to a construction project 
in  atofina now part of total petrochemicals inc hired conex international to be the mechanical contractor on a project at atofina s refinery in port arthur  texas 
fei was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to atofina on the project 
there was no contract between conex and fei 
later in after the project was complete  conex and atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project 
conex sued fei in september alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that fei should pay conex the balance of the extra work charges that atofina did not pay in the settlement 
conex also asserted that fei interfered with conex s contract and business relationship with atofina 
the jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference 
the company has appealed the decision and believes  based on the advice of counsel  that it is probable that any judgment based on this verdict would be overturned 
the company strongly believes that the judgment based on this verdict is supported neither by the facts nor the law  and will pursue all possible avenues for reconsideration or appeal 
accordingly  the company did not recognize a charge reflecting the verdict amount 
fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
v 
general electric company  et al in october  fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against general electric company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as saudi american general electric  a saudi arabian corporation 
the complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement  engineering and construction of the rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia 
subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter  the company initiated arbitration proceedings in new york under the american arbitration association international rules 
the evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded 
in january the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases  the first to be a decision on entitlement and second  a decision on damages 
on may  the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed fluor s entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for cost incurred in construction of the plant 
on april   the arbitration panel issued a partial final award stipulating the amount of entitlement to recovery of certain claims and awarding interest on the net amounts due fluor 
an award on the amount of interest due fluor is expected in the company does not expect that the final resolution of the arbitration will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of december   a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process 
these include an infrastructure joint venture project and the london connect project  which are discussed above under industrial infrastructure and certain embassy projects  which are discussed above under government 
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operating activities during was million compared with million in and million in during  cash generated by operating activities resulted from earnings sources and reduced working capital excluding cash  which includes the billing and collection of fees on the fernald project 
during  cash generated by operating activities resulted primarily from earnings sources 
the amount includes million collected in connection with the close out of a project in venezuela 
the levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix  stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects 
the increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients 
as work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin  cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion 
liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress 
as customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects  the company s cash position will be reduced

variable interest entities national roads telecommunications services nrts project in  the company s industrial infrastructure segment was awarded a million project by a joint venture  genesys telecommunications limited genesys  in which the company owns a percent interest and hsbc infrastructure fund management limited owns a percent interest 
the project was entered into with the united kingdom secretary of state for transport the highways agency to design  build  maintain and finance a significant upgrade to the integrated transmission network throughout england s motorways 
genesys financed the engineering and construction e c of the upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately million of non recourse debt the term loan facility from a consortium of lenders the banks along with joint venture member equity contributions and subordinated debt which were financed during the construction period utilizing equity bridge loans from outside lenders 
during september  the joint venture members paid their required permanent financing commitments in the amount of million and were issued subordinated notes by genesys 
these funds were used by genesys to repay the temporary construction term financing including the company s equity bridge loan 
in early october  the newly constructed network achieved operational status and was fully accepted by the highways agency on december   thereby concluding the e c phase and entering the operations and maintenance phase of the project 
based on a qualitative analysis of the variable interests of all parties involved at the formation of genesys  under the provisions of fin r  the company was initially determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
the company s consolidated financial statements included the accounts of genesys  and  accordingly  the non recourse debt provided by the banks from the inception of the venture 
effective october   the company no longer consolidates the accounts of genesys because it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
fin r requires that the initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie shall be reconsidered under certain conditions 
one of those conditions is when the entity s governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed in a manner that changes the characteristics or adequacy of the entity s equity investment at risk 
such an event occurred in september upon the infusion of capital by the joint venture members which resulted in permanent financing through issuance of subordinated notes by genesys that replaced the temporary equity bridge loans that had been provided by outside lenders 
this refinancing of temporary debt with permanent debt constituted a change in the governing documents of genesys that required reconsideration of genesys as a variable interest entity 
based on the new capitalization structure of genesys  the adequacy of the equity at risk in genesys was evaluated and found to be inadequate to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support 
accordingly  upon reconsideration  genesys continues to be a variable interest entity 
because the company holds a variable interest in the entity through its equity and debt investments  a qualitative evaluation was undertaken to determine if it was the primary beneficiary 
in this evaluation  the company considered all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests based on the contractual arrangements existing at the time of reconsideration 
based on this evaluation  the company has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of genesys 
accordingly  genesys is not consolidated in the company s accounts at december  and is being accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
the company s maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in genesys is its aggregate million equity and debt investment plus any un remitted earnings 
the term loan is an obligation of genesys and will never be a debt repayment obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members

guarantees in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities 
the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances 
the maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts 
the amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals billion as of december  amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable 
for cost reimbursable contracts  amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract 
for lump sum or fixed price contracts  this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract 
remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete 
in those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties  such as owners  co venturers  subcontractors or vendors for claims 
the carrying value of the liability for guarantees is not material 
financial guarantees  made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances  are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower 
most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property  plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay 
there are no material guarantees outstanding as of december  inflation although inflation and cost trends affect the company  its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts 
the company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions  however  management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business
