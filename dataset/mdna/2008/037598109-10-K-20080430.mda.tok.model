overview we are a leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of two segments architectural products and services architectural and large scale optical lso 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass  windows  storefront and entrances comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  inc  a leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters 
in december  we acquired all of the shares of tubelite  inc tubelite  a privately held business that fabricates aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry that was added to our architectural segment 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  inc  a manufacturer of value added glass and acrylic for the custom picture framing and commercial optics markets 
the following are the key items that impacted fiscal the architectural segment s operating results benefited from the influence of markets that are using more value added design and energy efficient products 
with increased sales resulting from our ability to capture business in these strong markets  combined with good project mix  capacity expansions  improvements in pricing and operational productivity improvements  we were able to improve operating earnings by percent for this segment 
despite flat revenues  operating income in the lso segment improved percent due to a favorable mix of our best value added picture framing glass products 
our backlog increased percent to million at march  compared to million at march  the architectural segment backlog  which represents more than percent of the backlog  increased percent over the prior year as a result of improvements in the commercial construction industry  increased capacity and demand for our products and services 
we acquired tubelite for million in december tubelite contributed million of sales to our architectural segment for the period subsequent to acquisition 
this acquisition was financed by an increase in long term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  together with cash generated from operations 
we completed our exit of the last business component of our auto glass segment which was reported as discontinued operations in  and realized a pre tax gain on disposal of million 
the facility of this operation has been retained and converted to provide additional capacity for our architectural glass fabrication business 

table of contents architectural segment 
our architectural segment is the largest and most cyclical segment in our portfolio 
the segment serves the commercial construction market  which has improved over our three most recent fiscal years 
we look at many market indicators such as office space vacancy rates  architectural billing statistics and other economic indicators to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
specifically  we focus on the us non residential construction market based on reports by mcgraw hill construction fw dodge mcgraw hill  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
we then adjust this information to conform to our fiscal year end and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately nine months after project start 
from their fourth quarter calendar report  the markets that we serve had an annual compounded growth rate of percent over our past three fiscal years 
the improvements in the strong markets we serve had a significant impact on the segment s results 
our segment s compounded annual growth rate over that same time period was nearly percent 
in fiscal  we increased revenues percent percent excluding the impact of tubelite and grew operating income percent 
our operating margin rose to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal our fiscal operating margins were significantly impacted in the third quarter by a million write down on three architectural glass installation projects in one market 
our fiscal operating margin without this write down would have been percent 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded an additional million to update the total costs to complete these projects 
the fourth quarter cost increases were offset by write ups on other jobs within the installation business that occur in the normal course of business 
in the short term  we are anticipating continued high levels of activity in the commercial construction market as mcgraw hill has estimated continued growth in united states construction value through our fiscal mcgraw hill projects that market value will roughly flatten out for the following two years at very high levels of activity 
however  we believe we will continue to grow in this time period as we focus on our value propositions and satisfy currently unmet demand 
building contractors value our ability to deliver quality  distinctive window and curtainwall solutions to projects on time and on budget  helping to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive looks  energy savings and security features of our glass systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher office lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a better environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
our overall strategy is to defend and grow our architectural business  primarily by increasing capacity and extending the reach of our architectural glass products 
in fiscal  we added capacity to our glass fabrication business which will enable us to serve more of the core  high value added  large project markets 
in fiscal  our architectural glass business will primarily supply larger  more complex projects 
the business will also expand its strategy of outsourcing some of its energy efficient coatings  a low capital way to meet demand that continues to exceed our capacity 
our window and installation businesses  which have also largely filled their capacity for fiscal  will remain focused on mid sized to smaller projects that ideally fit their capabilities 
in recent years  the construction market has identified certain environmentally friendly construction guidelines outlined in the leadership in energy and environmental design certification process leed often referred to as green buildings 
as industry leaders  we are well positioned to leverage the market transition to green  sustainable  commercial buildings  another key strategy for our architectural segment 
data is emerging that has found that leed certified buildings command rent premiums  higher occupancy rates and increased sales prices 
we believe these tangible benefits will accelerate the demand for new leed certified buildings and will encourage renovation of existing buildings  two trends that offer growth opportunities for our energy efficient glass and aluminum systems 
our strategy is to continue to partner with architects and building contractors to help them understand the benefits of incorporating our energy efficient products and system solutions in their green building projects 
a secondary strategy focuses on expanding our standard commercial window and storefront product lines 
our acquisition of tubelite will extend the range of related products and services we can offer  and we will continue to pursue strategies to extend our market reach 
lso segment 
our picture framing strategy is to convert the custom framing market to our highest value added products 
for fiscal  revenues for the segment were million  compared to million in the prior year 
included in the prior year results were million of sales from our pre framed art product line  which we sold during the third quarter of revenues from our value added picture framing products increased by nine percent over the prior year as favorable mix of high value added product was partially offset by a decrease in volume 
our strategy in the lso segment is to continue to grow sales of higher value added picture framing glass 
we continue to help framers sell consumers value added products rather than clear glass by showing framers how they can increase their profitability by selling up the value added picture framing glass continuum 
we offer framers point of purchase displays to assist them in showing their consumers the visual differences between clear glass and our value added picture framing glass products 

table of contents results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the percent increase in sales was primarily due to an improved commercial construction market enabling us to increase volume across all our architectural segment businesses but primarily in the architectural glass fabrication business 
we were able to increase volume in glass fabrication as a result of increased capacity  including the start up of the st 
george  utah facility 
sales were also impacted by improved pricing mix in the architectural glass fabrication and window businesses  and improved job cost flow in our architectural glass installation business 
it should be noted that fiscal contained only weeks compared to weeks in fiscal which negatively impacted fiscal net sales by percent 
fiscal compared to fiscal the percent increase in sales was primarily due to increased architectural glass pricing  improved job cost flow in our architectural installation business and increased volume across all of our architectural businesses primarily as a result of the improved north american commercial construction market 
fiscal also included weeks compared to the prior year week period  which had a percent impact on fiscal sales 
these increases were slightly offset by a decline in lso revenues as certain customers offered a less favorable product mix of value added picture framing glass during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net equity in loss earnings of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit improved by percentage points primarily as a result of pricing and better mix of projects within our architectural glass  window and installation businesses 
the gross margin also benefited from higher capacity utilization in the architectural segment businesses  as well as improved mix in the lso segment 
gross profit as a percentage of sales includes the impact of approximately negative percentage points for the year as a result of third quarter write downs of million on three architectural glass installation projects in our florida market 
as we neared completion of the projects in the third quarter  we identified significant workmanship and quality issues that would require significant costs to remediate and would likely result in the payment of additional contractual remedies to our customers 
these write downs reflected our conclusions that  as a result of these developments  the ultimate costs of the projects would exceed contract revenues 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded million of additional costs to complete these projects related to remediation activities and additional backcharges not previously identified 
two of these jobs were essentially completed by the end of fiscal  while we anticipate the last project will be completed during the first quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter cost increases were offset by write ups on other jobs within the installation business that occur in the normal course of business 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase relates primarily to expenditures to update our computer systems and information technology infrastructure  higher salaries and wages to support our growth  and increased incentive compensation expense due to improved financial performance 
interest expense decreased million from fiscal to fiscal this decrease includes a million decline due to lower average daily borrowing and lower weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility  partially offset by a decrease in interest capitalized for capital expenditure projects 
equity in affiliated companies reflects our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc ppg ag 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million on the goodwill associated with this investment 
in addition  our equity in the earnings of ppg ag decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as this business faces difficult market conditions 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the primary reason for this decrease in rate is due to the completion of an analysis of activities that are eligible for current and prior year research and development tax credits 
both current and additional prior years research and development tax credits are reflected in the fiscal rate 
earnings from discontinued operations of million net of tax in fiscal resulted from the gain on sale of certain assets related to our auto glass business of million  the reduction in reserves of million related to resolution of an outstanding legal matter in our discontinued european curtainwall operations and net loss from operations of our auto glass business of million 
in fiscal  we had immaterial net earnings from discontinued operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points in fiscal over fiscal the resulting decrease in gross margins was primarily due to the unfavorable shift in mix of value added picture framing glass and a million non cash charge related to the planned exit of the pre framed art wall d cor product line within the lso segment 
additionally  an increase in health insurance costs due to higher than expected utilization and a higher level of high dollar claims negatively impacted the gross margin 
these items were partially offset by improved pricing in the architectural segment  operational improvements across both the architectural and lso segments  net proceeds from the settlement of a class action lawsuit with a flat glass manufacturer  which impacted margins by percentage points  and improved project mix in the architectural segment 
sg a expenses decreased by percentage points as a percentage of net sales  but reflected an increase in spending of million over fiscal the increased spending was primarily due to increased salaries and wages  the impact of expensing stock options and increased incentive compensation expenses due to improved financial performance 
these increases were partially offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets in fiscal the reduction as a percentage of sales is primarily due to leveraging the fixed cost components of sg a on higher sales 
interest expense increased million over fiscal as a result of a higher weighted average interest rate  including the effects of our swap agreements  and an increase in average borrowings during the year 
an increase in the amount of interest that was capitalized into the cost of significant projects partially offset the increase in debt interest 
equity in affiliated companies reflects our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc 
income increased million over fiscal  reflecting higher sales volume  offset by lower selling prices as a result of market conditions 
income tax expense for fiscal increased by million over fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate to from was primarily due to the prior year  non cash resolution of certain tax matters  including completion of various audits and reviews by taxing authorities 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to fiscal earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to the improved results in our architectural segment businesses 

table of contents segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal the million or percent increase in architectural net sales from fiscal to fiscal reflects increased volume across all businesses  primarily due to an improved commercial construction market 
the improved market enabled us to utilize increased capacity in the architectural glass fabrication business leading to a significant portion of the increase in volume 
the increase in net sales is also due to improved pricing and project mix and productivity in our architectural glass fabrication and window businesses  and improved job cost flow in our architectural glass installation business 
revenue from tubelite subsequent to our december acquisition totaled million or percentage points of the overall fiscal year increase 
the architectural segment s operating income of million  or percent of sales  increased million or percent over fiscal operating income of million 
all businesses in the segment had improved operating income except our architectural glass installation business  where we experienced write downs during the third and fourth quarters on three projects within the florida market 
operating income improvements for the architectural segment reflect the impact of higher revenues as discussed above  improved pricing and a more favorable mix of projects with higher value added features 
fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal increased percent to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to increased architectural glass pricing  improved job cost flow in the installation business and increased volume in the glass fabrication business 
the primary driver behind these increases was the improvement in the overall commercial construction market 
mcgraw hill construction fw dodge reported non residential growth at percent for calendar year which relates to our fiscal in addition  the extra week in fiscal had an impact of percent on fiscal sales 
the segment s operating income in fiscal more than doubled compared to fiscal operating margin increased to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the increased operating income and margin reflect the higher pricing and operational improvements 
a better mix of projects with higher margins  particularly in our installation business  contributed to the improved margins as well 
also  the net flat glass settlement proceeds in the current year contributed million or percentage points 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues in fiscal decreased million from fiscal this net decrease reflects a modest increase in revenues from our picture framing business resulting from favorable product mix of our value added products  partially offset by a million decrease in sales from the pre framed art product line that was sold during the third quarter of fiscal operating income in the lso segment improved from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal as our picture framing business sold a higher percentage of our best  value added picture framing glass in the current year 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenue was down percent from fiscal due to an unusually strong fiscal additionally  during the first half of fiscal  certain customers offered a less favorable mix of value added picture framing products 
these factors were somewhat offset by the percent impact of the extra week in fiscal total value added picture framing glass remained high as a percent of total picture frame sales  at approximately percent  but the mix of best products was down from fiscal operating income decreased by percent in fiscal from fiscal  as a result of the less favorable value added picture framing glass mix 
in addition  we incurred a million non cash charge related to the planned exit of the pre framed art wall d cor product line 
these items were partially offset by the million net flat glass settlement proceeds  which increased margins by percentage points 

table of contents consolidated backlog at march   our consolidated backlog was million  up percent from the million reported at march  as a result of strong commercial construction market conditions 
the backlog of the architectural segment represented percent of consolidated backlog 
we expect percent of our total backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue 
we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator and is not an effective indicator of the ultimate profitability of our sales  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the shares of tubelite  inc  a privately held business  for million  including transaction costs of million and net of cash acquired of million 
tubelite s results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements and within the architectural segment since the date of acquisition 
tubelite fabricates aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry 
the purchase is part of the company s strategy to grow its presence in commercial architectural markets 
goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was million and is not tax deductible 
identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were million and include customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements with a weighted average useful life of years 
we continue to evaluate the purchase price allocations for intangible assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities  and expect to revise the allocation as better information becomes available 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company announced its intention to discontinue the manufacturing of automotive replacement glass products and also announced its decision to sell the remaining portion of the auto glass segment that manufactures and sells original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket replacement windshields for the recreational vehicle and bus markets 
the company restated the consolidated financial statements to show the results of the auto glass segment in discontinued operations 
the company completed the sale of certain assets related to the business during the third quarter of fiscal conclusion of the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million which is included in earnings from discontinued operations in the consolidated results of operations 
the auto glass segment s manufacturing facility was not part of the sale 
the facility was reclassified to architectural segment assets and has been converted to expand the capacity of the architectural segment s glass fabrication business 
in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations and a majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to discontinued operations are expected to be paid within the next three years 
the majority of these liabilities relate to the international curtainwall operations  including bonds outstanding  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters  will not be known until they are settled within the uk courts 
the reserve for discontinued operations also covers other liability issues  consisting of warranty and other costs relating to these and other international construction projects 
during the first quarter of fiscal  these reserves were reduced by million  primarily due to resolution of an outstanding legal matter related to a significant french curtainwall project  and were reported as earnings from discontinued operations 
the remaining results from discontinued operations in fiscal reflect the operating loss of the auto glass business 
related party transactions as a result of our percent interest in ppg auto glass  in which ppg holds the remaining interest  various transactions we enter into with ppg and ppg auto glass are deemed to be related party transactions 
under the terms of a multi year agreement which expired in fiscal  our auto glass manufacturing business had been committed to selling a significant portion of its windshield capacity to ppg 
we had been transitioning our capacity to sell directly to aftermarket manufacturers  including ppg 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue manufacturing arg products and ceased manufacturing these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal our investment in ppg auto glass totals million  which includes million in goodwill 
we assess the fair market value of this investment on a regular basis  as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we consider many factors  including short and long term projections of future performance associated with these assets 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed an assessment of the realizability of this asset in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  which resulted in an impairment charge of million reflected in equity in loss of affiliated companies 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired proceeds from dispositions of property borrowing repayment activities  net purchases and retirement of company common stock dividends paid operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million for fiscal and million for fiscal  both of which were driven by higher net earnings and effective working capital management 
we continue to focus on lowering our working capital requirements 
non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash  less current liabilities was million at march  or percent of fiscal sales  our key metric 
this compares to million at march  or percent of fiscal sales 
the largest contributors to the improvement in this metric were a million increase in billings in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts  and improved receivable collection processes that drove the number of days sales outstanding to days from days at fiscal both of these improvements were the result of better contract management 
investing activities 
investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal capital expenditures included spending of million for a building expansion and equipment for tru vue to expand capacity of our highest value added picture framing products and million for expansion of our architectural glass fabrication facilities  including finalization of the st 
george  utah facility and conversion of our auto glass manufacturing facility to support architectural glass 
fiscal expenditures included the majority of the spending for our architectural glass capacity expansion in st 
george  utah 
during fiscal  the company exercised buy out options on two equipment sale and leaseback agreements for million and included these in capital expenditures 
the primary reason for the increase in investing activities in fiscal was our investment in tubelite on december  we acquired all of the shares of tubelite  a privately held business  for million  including transaction costs of million and net of cash acquired of million 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding this acquisition 
in fiscal  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million  including capital for expansion and modernization of the architectural window facility in wausau  wisconsin  and capacity expansions and productivity improvements in both operating segments 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 
at march   the company has one sale and leaseback agreement for a building that provides an option to purchase the building at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in the lease is classified as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the company has a deferred gain of million under this sale and leaseback transaction  which is included as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the average annual lease payment over the life of the remaining lease is million 
financing activities 
net proceeds from borrowings for fiscal were million  net payments were million in fiscal and net proceeds in fiscal were million 
total outstanding borrowings increased to million at march  from million at the end of fiscal the primary reason for the increase in borrowings during fiscal was to finance the purchase of tubelite 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at the end of fiscal  up from percent at the end of fiscal  primarily as a result of the acquisition 
the majority of our long term debt at the end of the year  million  consisted of bank borrowings under our million syndicated revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices 
the board of directors increased this authorization by  shares in january we repurchased  shares under this program  for a total of million  through february  no share 
table of contents repurchases were made under this plan during fiscal we repurchased  shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal for million 
we have purchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million since the inception of this program and have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program 
in addition to the shares repurchased under the repurchase plan  we also purchased million and million of company stock from employees pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
we have paid million in dividends during the current year  compared to million in the prior year as a result of making four quarterly payments in the current year 
we made five payments in the prior year period  solely due to timing of payments 
other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total borrowings under credit facility industrial revenue bonds operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations uncertain tax positions environmental liabilities interest on fixed rate debt other obligations total cash obligations we maintain a million revolving credit facility which expires in november borrowings of million were outstanding as of march  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at march  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a debt to cash flow ratio of no more than 
this ratio is computed daily  with cash flow computed on a rolling month basis 
our ratio was at march  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lender may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at march   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
long term debt also includes million of industrial development bonds that mature in fiscal years through as of march   we have purchase obligations totaling million  the majority of which are for raw material commitments 
it also includes million committed for the modernization and expansion of our architectural window facility and million related to expansion of our viracon facilities 
we expect to make contributions of million to our pension plans in fiscal the fiscal expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
as of march   we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities  respectively 
we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
the company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements that  at march   effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
these agreements call for an additional million of variable rate borrowings to be converted into fixed rate obligations during the first quarter of fiscal these agreements expire in fiscal for each of these interest rate swaps  the company receives payments at variable rates while making payments at fixed rates of between and percent 
the impact of these interest rate swaps is reflected in the interest on fixed rate debt in the above table 
at march   the company had two interest rate swap agreements that converted million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
the company terminated these agreements during fiscal the net present liability associated with these swaps was immaterial at the end of both fiscal and 
table of contents in addition to the interest on fixed rate debt  we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt 
as of march   variable interest rate debt  excluding the million that is contractually fixed  was million with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
the variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges  and are included in the balance sheet with other long term liabilities  with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income 
derivative gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs 
gains or losses on ineffectiveness were not material 
from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in our operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with current and former employees 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for our industrial development bonds  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to obtain a surety or performance bond that commits payments to our customers for any non performance on our behalf 
at march   million of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of million 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract 
with respect to our current portfolio of businesses  we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds 
we self insure our third party product liability coverages 
as a result  a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at march  or march  outlook the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to increase to percent 
architectural segment revenues are expected to increase to percent for the year 
large scale optical segment revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year 
annual gross margins are expected to be slightly less than percent  or to percentage points higher than in fiscal  increased pricing  operational improvements and cost reductions are expected to more than offset increases in wages  health care  energy  materials and freight 
expected annual operating margins by segment are architectural  to percent  and large scale optical  to percent 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales are projected to be slightly less than percent 
equity in affiliates  which reflects apogee s portion of the results of the ppg auto glass joint venture  is expected to report pre tax earnings of approximately million 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million  including capital for modernization of the architectural window facility  and capacity expansions and productivity improvements in both segments 
depreciation and amortization are estimated at approximately million for the year 
debt is expected to be approximately to million at year end

critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our installation business records revenue on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenues earned from construction contracts 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
we base our determination of value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
we also consider other factors such as public information for transactions made on similar businesses to ours 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts will be attained 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 
reserves for discontinued operations we reserve for the remaining estimated future cash outflows associated with our exit from discontinued operations 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next three years 
the primary components of the accruals relate to the remaining exit costs from the international curtainwall operations of our large scale construction business 
these long term accruals include settlement of outstanding performance bonds  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk courts 
we also reserve for product liability issues and the related legal costs for specific projects completed both domestically and internationally 
we reserve based on known claims  estimating their expected losses  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs for these discontinued operations projects 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices and architect s and engineer s errors and omissions risk and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
additionally  we maintain a self insurance reserve for our health insurance programs maintained for the benefit of our eligible employees and non employee directors 
we estimate a reserve based on historical levels of amounts for claims incurred but not reported 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which was adopted on february  under this standard  the fair value of each share based payment award is estimated on the date of grant and  in the case of performance based awards  updated throughout the year 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment 
table of contents awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
for other performance based awards  we estimate the future performance of the company as an input into the expense and liability 
any change in the actual results from our assumptions could have a material impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations and fixed income securities  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we use interest rate swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest rate swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the net present liability associated with these swaps was minimal at the end of fiscal subsequent to march   we have entered into two additional interest rate swaps effectively hedging million of variable rate borrowing  fixing the rate at between percent and percent 
the interest rate swaps are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges  and are included in the balance sheet with other long term liabilities  with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income 
derivative gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments at march  would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
besides the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of municipal bond obligations 
we have not seen significant fluctuation in market values of our investments as a result of the recent changes in the investment market 
we generally do not have significant exposure to foreign exchange risk as the majority of our sales are within the united states and those outside the united states are generally denominated in us dollars
