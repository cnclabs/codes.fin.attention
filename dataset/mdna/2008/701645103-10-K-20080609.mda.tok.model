item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on may   we announced a two for one stock split of common stock in the form of a dividend  for stockholders of record on may  the stock split 
the stock split was effected on june  and did not include shares held in treasury 
all discussions concerning common stock  earnings per share  and outstanding shares throughout this annual report on form k as well as comparable share information  have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
in connection with the stock split  we modified outstanding warrants 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded during the quarter ended june  overview parlux fragrances  inc is engaged in the business of creating  designing  manufacturing  distributing and selling prestige fragrances and beauty related products marketed primarily through specialty stores  national department stores and perfumeries on a worldwide basis 
the fragrance market is generally divided into a prestige group distributed primarily through department and specialty stores and a mass market group primarily chain drug stores  mass merchandisers  smaller perfumeries and pharmacies 
our fragrance products are positioned primarily in the prestige group 
we distribute certain brands through perfumania  a specialty retailer of fragrances in the united states and puerto rico  a wholly owned subsidiary of ecmv 
our former chairman and ceo  mr 
ilia lekach  had a significant shareholder interest in ecmv and held identical management positions until february  when he sold most of his shares in ecmv to the new majority owners  the nussdorfs 
shortly thereafter  mr 
lekach resigned from the ecmv board and was terminated as ceo  without cause  as a result of the change in management 
we previously maintained an approximate ownership interest in ecmv until we sold all of our shares in ecmv during august and september the nussdorfs acquired an approximate at that time ownership interest in parlux during august and september and accordingly  all transactions with ecmv or perfumania will continue to be reported as related party transactions 
 the nussdorfs currently own approximately of our outstanding shares 
during the fiscal year ended march   we engaged in the manufacture through sub contractors  distribution and sale of paris hilton  guess  jessica simpson  nicole miller  ocean pacific  maria sharapova and xoxo fragrances and grooming items on an exclusive basis as a licensee 
during december  we sold the perry ellis fragrance rights and other related assets to the licensor  perry ellis international pei 
we also had rights to distribute royal copenhagen fragrances in the us department store market until july  additionally  we previously manufactured  distributed and sold fred hayman beverly hills fhbh fragrances on a worldwide basis until we sublicensed these rights in we have expanded our product offerings under the paris hilton brand into the accessory market  specifically  watches  handbags  purses  small leather goods  cosmetics and sunglasses 
such products  which have similar distribution channels to our fragrance products  could strengthen our position with our current customers and distributors while providing incremental sales volume 
we are currently analyzing different options for these additional licenses to determine the most efficient and profitable method to produce and distribute such products  including possible assignment or sublicensing of our rights thereunder 
during the year ended march   we sublicensed the international rights for handbags generating  in sublicense revenue 
we anticipate minimum revenues of  under this sublicense for fiscal the paris hilton and guess brands of fragrances and accessories accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended march   and and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the year ending march  if paris hilton s appeal as a celebrity were to diminish  or guess would not approve shipments to our international distributors see licensing agreements for further discussion it could result in a material reduction in our sales of products licensed by them  adversely affecting our results of operations and operating cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for long lived assets 
the value of our long lived assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review long lived assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
the identification and measurement of impairment of long lived assets involves the estimation of the fair value of the related asset 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about discounted expected future cash flows 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant most of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return a product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in our assessment of customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is generally after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that our customers request approval for the return of unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the provision for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  if actual returns received exceeds estimates  reducing net sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
inventory write downs 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  or changes in consumer preferences  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
if warranted  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
on april   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
in making this assessment  a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based solely on the technical merits of the position and mus t assume that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
once the recognition threshold is met  the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
in addition  the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or adjust any recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions and  accordingly  we were not required to record any cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
as of both the date of adoption and march   there was no material liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments relating to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months  however  the outcome of tax matters is uncertain and unforeseen results can occur 
stock based compensation 
prior to april   we accounted for our compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share was required in order to show our net income as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure 
this information is contained in note v to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
previously  companies were required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and could elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
as discussed above  we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas no 
r  however  in adopting sfas no 
r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption used by us continues to be available 
sfas no 
r was effective for our fiscal year beginning april  transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in the footnotes 
we have adopted prospectively  and will continue to utilize the current black scholes option pricing model 
there were no unvested options or warrants outstanding at march   and as such  the result of adopting sfas no 
r on april   did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of outstanding warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded for the current fiscal year period 
since april  we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies other than the adoption of sfas r discussed above 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes how to measure fair value based on a three level hierarchy of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable 
level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value in order to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year ending march  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the financial impact of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  or arb  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement also amends certain of arb s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas r 
in addition  sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are currently assessing the financial impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the current gaap hierarchy  as set forth in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts 
the fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
accordingly  the fasb concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and is issuing this statement to achieve that result 
this statement is eff ective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
significant trends over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry in general is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
we believe these trends will continue 
if on e or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  or the appeal of the celebrity would diminish  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
in addition  certain us department store retailers have consolidated operations resulting in the closing of retail locations as well as implementing various inventory control initiatives 
we expect that these store closings  the inventory control initiatives and internal reorganizations will continue to affect our sales in the short term 
historically  as is the case for most fragrance companies  our sales have been influenced by seasonal trends generally related to holiday or gift giving periods 
substantial sales often occur during the final month of each quarter 
this practice assumes activities in future periods will support planned objectives  but there can be no assurance that will be achieved and future periods may be negatively affected 
results of operations on november   our board of directors approved the sale of the perry ellis fragrance brand license and related assets back to pei 
a definitive agreement was signed on december  and the sale closed shortly thereafter 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion 
the results presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and include activity relating to the perry ellis brand as discontinued operations 
for comparison purposes  prior period financial information has been restated accordingly 
our discussions below exclude perry ellis activities  which are addressed separately in the discussion of discontinued operations 
we did business with fragrance distributors owned operated by individuals related to our former chairman and ceo 
through june   these sales were included as related party sales in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   the former chairman and ceo s beneficial ownership interest in the company was approximately 
during the quarter ended september  his beneficial ownership declined to less than 
accordingly  the company s management determined that  effective as of july   transactions with such parties will no longer be reported as related party transactions 
as of march   the former chairman and ceo s beneficial ownership interest in the company was less than 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold  since we allocate a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and include the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses for the years ended march   and include approximately   and  respectively  relating to the cost of warehouse operations not allocated to inventories and other related distribution expenses excluding shipping expenses which are recorded as cost of goods sold 
a portion of these costs is allocated to inventory in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  net sales during the year ended march   net sales increased to  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to a increase in paris hilton fragrance and accessories sales  which provided  in gross sales compared to  in the prior year 
the current year included the launch of paris hilton can can 
this was partially offset by a  reduction in gross sales of guess brand products due to the distribution restrictions placed by guess on international shipments  which were in effect early in our fiscal year 
these restrictions are more fully described in note d to our consolidated financial statements 
net sales to unrelated customers  which represent of our total net sales for the current period  increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of a increase in paris hilton fragrance and accessories sales to  in the current year  from  in the prior year  which included the launch of paris hilton can can 
this was offset by a reduction in guess brand products to  from  in the prior year  due to the distribution restrictions placed by guess on international shipments 
of this amount  net sales to the us department store sector increased from  to  while net sales to international distributors increased from  to  the increase in sales to us department stores was mainly attributable to a  increase in gross sales of guess products  partially offset by a reduction of  in gross sales of paris hilton fragrances and accessories 
the increase in sales to international distributors was mainly attributable to an increase of  in gross sales of paris hilton fragrances and accessories  partially offset by a reduction of  in gross sales of guess brand products due to the distribution restrictions placed by guess on international shipments 
sales to related parties see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of related parties increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of increases in paris hilton brand gross sales of  offset by a decrease of  in guess brand gross sales as discussed above 
cost of goods sold our overall cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the current fiscal year ended march   compared to in the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for the current period  as compared to and  respectively  for the prior year 
the current year includes a higher percentage of sales to us department stores and perfumania  which sales have a higher margin than sales of these products to international distributors 
the current year also has a lower percentage of guess product sales  which sales  for the most part  have a lower margin than sales of our other products  along with a decrease in the sale of value sets  which include multiple products and also have a lower margin than sales of basic product 
total operating expenses total operating expenses decreased by compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the prior year included certain unusual and significant prior year expenses described below 
advertising and promotional expenses advertising and promotional expenses decreased to  compared to  in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
during the year ended march   we focused our attention on reducing expenditures  particularly in the area of advertising and promotion 
the current year amount includes promotional costs in connection with the continued roll out of guess and paris hilton fragrances for women and men on a worldwide basis and the launch of paris hilton can can and guess by marciano fragrances for women mainly in us department stores 
we anticipate that promotional spending for the paris hilton and guess brands will continue at these levels during periods which contain new product launches 
selling and distribution costs selling and distribution costs decreased to  compared to  in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the centralization of all distribution activities in our new jersey facility  resulting in a decrease of staff in our florida warehouse facility 
the prior year period also included approximately  for inventory relocation costs in connection with our shifting of distribution activities to new jersey 
royalties royalties increased by in the current year  remaining constant as a percentage of net sales at  based upon the license requirements for the current sales mix  and minimum royalties for certain brands 
we anticipate that this percentage will decrease over time as additional sales of non fragrance products increase and minimum royalties on such licenses are absorbed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the prior year  from  to  decreasing as a percentage of sales from to 
the current year s decrease reflects our efforts to reduce discretionary spending 
the prior period included non cash  share based compensation charges in the amounts of  and  relating to fully vested warrants issued during the period from through  which were modified in connection with the stock split  and the february consent solicitation settlement  respectively  see notes v and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the decrease was also attributable to decreases in legal fees  and settlement costs and other expenses  of approximately  in connection with various litigation and the february consent solicitation see notes and  respectively  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
additional increases of  were incurred in the prior year period for professional fees relating to the special audit committee investigation as a result of allegations made in certain litigation and the sarbanes oxley act of remediation and maintenance  coupled with increases in property insurance costs and personnel additions in accounting  package development  quality assurance and production planning 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased from  to  the decrease reflects a  reduction in the impairment charge for the xoxo fragrance license  in the current year compared to  in the prior year  partially offset by a full year s depreciation and amortization of equipment and leasehold improvements at our new jersey facility which were placed in service in september gain on sale of property held for sale the prior year period included a gain of  from the sale of a warehouse facility in sunrise  florida 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
operating income loss as a result of the above factors  we realized operating income from continuing operations for the current year of  compared to an operating loss of  for the prior year 
other income and gain on sale of investment during the current year  we reported other income primarily related to a  gain on an insurance recovery resulting from an inventory theft  which was in excess of the recorded value of the stolen inventory 
the prior year period includes a gain from the sale of our investment in ecmv in the amount of  see note for further discussion 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased by to  in the current year compared to  for the prior year  as we used our line of credit less to finance our receivables and inventory 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  income taxes  discontinued operations and net income income from continuing operations before income taxes for the current year was  compared to a loss of  in the prior year 
our tax provision for the current year reflects an estimated effective rate of from continuing operations 
the effective rate in the prior year of from continuing operations results from a limitation on the estimated deferred tax benefit that was expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification and the  loss for income tax purposes resulting from the sale of the ecmv shares due to a difference in basis see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the benefit from the share based compensation charge was limited by the maximum allowable annual compensation deduction for certain corporate officers under section m of the internal revenue code 
consequently  the benefit recorded in the prior year reflected management s best estimate at that time based upon assumptions regarding the timing and market value of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and the amount and nature of other forms of compensation to be paid to the holders of the warrants using the method in which cash compensation salary and bonus of the related individuals takes priority over the share based compensation in determining the annual limitation 
in february  our former chairman and ceo resigned 
the estimated limitation on the deferred tax benefit that was expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification was reviewed and adjusted accordingly at the time we reported our results of operations for the year ended march  as a result  we realized income from continuing operations of  for the current year compared to a loss of  in the prior year 
income from discontinued operations see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  net of the tax effect  was  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
as a result  we earned net income of  and  for the current and prior year  respectively 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  net sales during the year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to the launch of guess gold for women in september and the continued international rollout of guess women s fragrance  which originally shipped domestically during september  and guess men s fragrance which commenced shipping domestically in march  which provided  in gross sales compared to  in the prior year 
gross sales of paris hilton products increased to  compared to  primarily due to sales of the watch and handbag lines 
this was partially offset by a  reduction in gross sales of op brand products since no new products were introduced during the current period pending strategic direction from op s new owner 
warnaco acquired the op brand during  and subsequ ently sold the brand to iconics brand group  inc net sales to unrelated customers  which represent of our total net sales for the year ended march   increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of the guess and paris hilton brand sales discussed above  offset by the reduction in op brand sales 
of this amount  net sales to the us department store sector increased from  to  while net sales to international distributors increased from  to  the increase in sales to us department stores was mainly attributable to a  increase in gross sales of guess products  partially offset by a reduction of  in gross sales of paris hilton brand products

in addition  the current year also includes a higher percentage of value sets sold to both unrelated customers and related parties  which include multiple products and have a higher cost of goods compared to basic stock items 
total operating expenses total operating expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to as a result of certain unusual and significant expenses described below 
however  certain individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes

the amount for the year ended march  includes promotional costs in connection with the continued roll out of guess and paris hilton fragrances for women and men on a worldwide basis and the launch of the guess gold for women fragrance mainly in us department stores  respectively 
during january and february  we committed to certain spending levels in the u 
s 
department store channel based on projected sales 
however  due to the consolidations and inventory controls measures discussed in significant trends above  sales to this channel were substantially less than originally anticipated and certain promotional activities during this year  which were committed to in advance  could not be cancelled 
selling and distribution costs selling and distribution costs increased to  compared to  in the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to approximately  and  in additional costs for temporary warehouse storage space  and freight charges for relocation of inventory to our new distribution center in new jersey  respectively  as well as approximately  and  for rent and personnel costs for the new jersey distribution center 
additional increases were incurred in headcount and travel expenses to support domestic department store sales growth 
royalties royalties increased by in the year ended march   remaining constant as a percentage of net sales at  based upon the license requirements for the current sales mix  and minimum royalties for certain brands

gain on sale of investment the year ended march  includes a gain from the sale of our investment in ecmv in the amount of  see note for further discussion 
net interest expense net interest expense increased to  in the current year compared to  for the prior year  as we used our line of credit to finance higher receivables and inventory to support sales growth 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  income taxes  discontinued operations and net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march  was  compared to income of  in the prior year 
our tax provision for the prior year reflects an estimated effective rate of from continuing operations 
the effective rate in the current year of from continuing operations results from a limitation on the estimated deferred tax benefit that is expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification  and  the  loss for income tax purposes resulting from the sale of the ecmv shares due to a difference in basis see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the benefit from the share based compensation charge will be limited by the maximum allowable annual compensation deduction for certain corporate officers under section m of the internal revenue code 
consequently  the benefit recorded in the current year reflects management s best estimate at the present time based upon assumptions regarding the timing and market value of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and the amount and nature of other forms of compensation to be paid to the holders of the warrants using the method in which cash compensation salary and bonus of the related individuals takes priority over the share based compensation in determining the annual limitation 
actual tax benefits realized may be greater or less than the amounts recorded  and such differences may be material 
as a result  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended march  compared to income of  in the prior year 
income from discontinued operations  which includes a pretax gain of  in the year ended march  from the sale of our perry ellis fragrance brand and the related assets see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  net of the tax effect  was  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
as a result  we earned net income of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to  as of march   compared to  at march  the increase was mainly attributable to the current period s net income  excluding the effect of the non cash compensation charges  the reduction of our credit facility  the increase in cash on hand and the reduction of our inventory levels 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to cash used in operating activities of  during the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to a decrease in inventories  prepaid expenses and income tax receivable  offset by increases in trade receivables from both related and unrelated customers 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
the current year included the collection of the final balance due from the sale of the perry ellis brand 
the prior year included the net proceeds from the sales of the perry ellis brand  the sunrise facility and our investment in affiliate 
this was partially offset by the increased purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in financing activities increased to  in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to the pay down of our line of credit 
the prior year included the repayment of the  balance of the mortgage concurrently with the sale of the sunrise facility 
as of march  and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and number of days cost of sales in inventory  on an annualized basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related perfumania other related total receivables inventories accounts receivable balances and the number of days sales in accounts receivable do not exclude perry ellis activity since such activity is not brand specific 
calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in the number of days sales from to for unrelated customers was mainly attributable to improved sales to our international distributors along with increased sales to domestic department stores of mother s day merchandise which shipped in march terms for our international distributors  for the most part  range from to days  compared to between and days for us department store customers 
based on current circumstances  we anticipate the number of days for the unrelated customer group will range between and days during fiscal the number of days sales in trade receivables from perfumania continue to exceed those of unrelated customers  due mainly to their seasonal cash flow see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
management closely monitors our activity with perfumania and holds periodic discussion s with perfumania management in order to review their anticipated payments for each quarter 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may require us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
during the current year  the number of days sales in inventory decreased from days to days 
at the end of the prior year our inventory balances were significantly higher due to the significant number of new product launches during fiscal year  and the forecasted sales increases for these products  in particular  the guess branded products 
during fiscal we focused our efforts on reducing inventory levels to more reasonable amounts 
we anticipate that  as new licenses are signed  and new products are launched  our inventory levels will increase in relation to anticipated sales for our existing products  as well as any new products 
we believe that the carrying value of our inventory at march   based on current conditions  is stated at the lower of cost or market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our products worldwide with all such sales being denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we were not at risk to foreign exchange translation exposure  other than with our canadian distributor  where we assumed such risk only through september during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded foreign exchange gains of  relating to sales collection activity with our canadian distributor 
the current period foreign exchange loss of  results mainly from transaction costs with suppliers 
we could  however  be subject to changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we are represented internationally 
we closely monitor such conditions and are able  for the most part  to adjust our sales strategies accordingly 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank line of credit 
the bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources 
we mitigate interest rate risk by continuously monitoring the interest rates and electing the lower of the fixed rate libor or prime rate option available under the line of credit 
when borrowing for our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
as of march  the primary source of funds for future working capital and other needs was our million line of credit 
as of march  we had cash and cash equivalents of the line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of prime less 
we believe a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates would increase future annual interest expense by approximately million
