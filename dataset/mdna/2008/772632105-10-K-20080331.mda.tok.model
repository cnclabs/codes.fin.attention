item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
general rock of ages is an integrated quarrier and manufacturer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
until january   we were also engaged in the retail sale of memorials 
accordingly  during  we had three business segments quarry  manufacturing and retail 
on january   we sold our retail operations and exited the retail business 
the retail division was classified as discontinued operations as of december  the quarry division sells granite blocks to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials and mausoleums used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sold granite memorials directly to consumers 
in  our quarry group showed increases in net revenue from of million while divisional operating income of million was up over during  demand for our granites in export markets continued to rebound from the sharp decline we suffered in  however  domestic demand for our barre gray granite continued to decline slowly 
following is a brief analysis of each of the individual quarries 
in our barre gray quarry  the gross margin percentage stayed the same  but sales were down from levels yielding slightly lower gross margin dollars 
we continue to improve production and development at our bethel quarry and demand remains strong 
the salisbury pink quarry in north carolina continued to increase its sales in the export market as we saw improved shipments along with improved margins and a lower cost per cubic foot at the quarry 
our gardenia and rockwell white quarries  continued to struggle with production recovery issues and continued to have negative gross margins  although the cost per cubic foot decreased in from the year before 
changes in management and production methods at our north carolina operations should have a positive effect during to both production and recovery 
the pennsylvania black quarry also continued to experience recovery problems in net revenue was up slightly but still we ended with a negative gross profit for the year 
we implemented changes in management and production methods in and we expect increases in both recovery and the production rate for in pennsylvania 
results from our canadian quarries were down slightly from revenue and gross margins were both down in the galactic blue quarry in the ukraine  which was attributed to disappointing production levels from vika 
vika  a quarry company in which we have held a equity interest since  experienced continuing operational difficulties in leading to reductions in both the production and sale of galactic blue granite blocks 
during the year  the company had advanced an additional  to vika but at the end of the fourth quarter of decided that it would no longer advance any additional funds 
at the same time  the company began to negotiate an arrangement with the other owners of vika to have its advances of approximately  repaid 
this arrangement  which will call for separate repayment schedules for advances in the form of notes and advances for future inventory purchases  has not yet been finalized by the parties 
in connection with our assessment of our investment in vika  the company also analyzed vika s current financial condition and prospects for the foreseeable future 
in addition  senior management made a site visit to the ukraine in late february based on our analysis of financial data provided by vika  the decision to no longer fund vika s cash needs  limited access by vika to third party funding and the results of the recent site visit including discussions with local management  the company determined that its investment in vika of  had experienced an impairment in value that was other than temporary 
based on that assessment  the company also concluded that its advances to vika should be fully reserved as of december  accordingly  a charge of  was recognized in the fourth quarter and is separately presented in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  we will continue to aggressively market our granite blocks in the us and abroad and make productivity improvements and control costs and recovery rates 
we believe that most of the productivity challenges we encountered in have been addressed as we move into the manufacturing division had another strong year in divisional operating income increased to million  which followed a increase to million in net revenue and gross margins increased and were only slightly offset by somewhat higher sg a 
monumental shipments for both traditional monuments and mausoleums increased by million and million  respectively  from demand for these projects remains strong and orders and shipments of the memorials generally sold by our authorized retailers are steady 
industrial products shipments declined approximately  in but the gross margin increased from to 
accordingly  gross profit dollars were only  less than we will continue to pursue a strategy of focusing on the mausoleum and large features market where our product is superior and margins are generally higher  as well as increasing our efforts to expand our wholesale distribution system to the cemetery  funeral home and traditional memorial retailers to grow our traditional monument business 
as of december  the retail division was classified as a discontinued operation 
the million loss from discontinued operations in includes a million impairment charge to write the book value of the division to fair value and  in income from operations  which is net of  of interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations

critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee and our independent auditor 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets and long term investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  and accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits 
revenue recognition quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped and invoiced from the quarry  except for cases noted below 
we generally provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and at their request we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
blocks are sold when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site  requests the block be stored and they have significant business reasons to do so 
at that time  the block is removed from our inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately mid march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  manufacturing plants remain open and many customers prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing division we record revenue related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities or set in the cemetery  if we are responsible for the setting  which is when risk of ownership transfers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues related to finished products transferred internally to our owned retail outlets are recorded as revenue by the retail division when ultimately sold to an outside customer 
retail division retail revenues were recorded when the finished monument was set in the cemetery  which was when risk of ownership transferred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed and collectibility was reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  sfas no 

such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of the assets depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the current and deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of current and deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
this assessment is made each reporting period 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company believed it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets 
therefore  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by recording a tax expense of million in the second quarter of to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
at the end of and  we reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits we provide defined benefit pension and other post employment benefit plans for certain employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets  discount rates and  to a lesser extent  the rate of increase in health care costs due to the small number of individuals receiving this benefit 
the expected long term rate of return has remained the same at and reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in we increased the discount rate used to determine our liability in the pension plans from to based on a bond matching model which uses data on individual high quality corporate bonds and the timing and amount of the future benefit payments in our plan to develop a weighted discount rate specific to our plan 
in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or a decrease in discount rate could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  sfas no 

this statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
it also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements was implemented as of december  the company recognized a reduction of  in prepaid pension costs and intangible assets  an increase of  in accrued pension and post retirement liabilities  and a charge of  to accumulated other comprehensive loss

results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarry and manufacturing gross profit and sg a  which are shown as a percentage of their respective divisions revenues 
year ended december  statement of operations data net revenues quarry manufacturing total net revenues cost of goods sold quarry manufacturing total cost of goods sold gross profit quarry manufacturing total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses quarry manufacturing corporate overhead impairment of note receivable impairment of investment and advances insurance recovery quarry asset foreign exchange loss other income  net total sg a expenses income loss from continuing operations interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss the financial information for has been reclassified to present the retail division as discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue increased  gross profit increased and total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased from shipments in were higher than in all quarries except barre and galactic blue 
the bethel white  salisbury pink and gardenia white granites are very popular for building purposes and we sell these granites primarily to international customers 
demand for our barre gray quarry  primarily used for memorials  continues to decline slowly 
we believe that imported granites  which generally are less expensive  are being substituted in the lower end of the memorials market and the color choices among granites in the memorial market has reduced the share of gray granite as a percentage of the market 
the galactic blue granite  which is quarried by vika ltd in the ukraine  which we own a one third interest in  continues to generate interest and orders  however  production has been extremely poor as vika continues to develop and open the quarry 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points to from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of improvements in production and recovery at the north carolina and pennsylvania quarries 
sg a expenses in our quarry segment for decreased from primarily due to increased convention and export sales expenses offset by decreased administrative salaries and expenses 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased from the increase was primarily a result of increased shipments from our memorials group which more than offset a decline in precision products sales 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the increase in gross profit margin resulted from improved production methods which resulted in lower labor costs 
sg a expenses for the manufacturing group were up from the prior year primarily as a result of increased commission costs of  consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead increased  or  from the prior year mainly due to professional fees related to analyzing strategic alternatives for the company and our sox compliance efforts which were partially offset by decreases in salary costs 
in  we recognized an impairment of  on a long term note receivable which dated back to the sale of a manufacturing plant in elberton  georgia in vika  a quarry company in which we have held a equity interest since  experienced continuing operational difficulties in leading to reductions in both the production and sale of galactic blue granite blocks 
in connection with its assessment of its investment in vika  the company also analyzed vika s current financial condition and prospects for the foreseeable future 
based on its analysis of financial data provided by vika  the decision to no longer fund vika s cash needs  limited access to third party funding and the results of the recent site visit  including discussions with local management  the company determined that its investment in vika of  had experienced an impairment in value that was other than temporary 
based on that assessment  the company also concluded that its advances to vika should be fully reserved as of december  accordingly  a charge of  was recognized in the fourth quarter and is separately presented in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  late in  an incident with a derrick in our barre quarry resulted in significant damage to the derrick 
we have received insurance recoveries totaling  that restored the derrick to usefulness 
these payments have been recognized in the period they were received 
foreign exchange losses in were  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
total interest expense was approximately million in total for both and interest expense from continuing operations decreased from million to million primarily as a result of the amount of interest allocated to discontinued operations 
during  the total debt level decreased by million but the interest rates paid on our credit facility are tied to libor and the prime rate  both of which increased during and again in before decreasing again in the fourth quarter of the income tax expense for was  compared with  for the tax expense in both years reflects taxes at our canadian subsidiary 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company determined it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax asset 
this resulted in a charge to tax expense of million in the second quarter of this action did not affect the cash taxes paid by the company 
in each subsequent quarter since then  we have reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from the us operation in the future 
we had a loss from discontinued operations of million in the loss is made up of income from the discontinued retail operations of  an impairment charge to write down the retail division to its fair market value of million and interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of  this compares to a loss of million in which is made up of income from the discontinued kershaw operations of  gain on the sale of the kershaw quarries of  loss from the discontinued retail operations of million and interest allocated to the discontinued operations of liquidity and capital resources historically  we have met our short term liquidity requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
our credit facility with our lenders was renewed on october  for a term of five years 
in january  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of the retail division 
we applied million of these proceeds to the long term debt and million to the revolving credit facility 
in  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan increased by approximately million as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the pension benefit obligation from to  the staff reductions in and good investment results 
we have historically contributed between  and million per year to the plan 
we contributed  in and expect to contribute  in in august  the pension protection act was signed into law 
among other things  the act is aimed at strengthening pension plans by requiring most pension plans to become fully funded over a seven year period 
the company is required to fully fund our pension plan by december  we will continue this process of funding the million unfunded pension liability as of december  by contributing an additional  in  which is included in the  mentioned above which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
see item a  risk factors and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our primary need for capital will be to maintain and improve our quarrying and manufacturing facilities 
we have approximately million budgeted for capital expenditures in cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of approximately million at december  the increase in working capital is mainly due to the classification of the entire amount due under our credit facility as a current liability in along with a decrease in the borrowings under the line of credit and an increase in inventory in cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of  in with a larger net loss in the primary reason for the change is that the net loss was primarily due to the non cash impairment charge on the write down of the retail division of million and the impairment charge on our vika related assets of million 
this was offset by a million increase in inventory coupled with decreases in accounts payable and accruals of  cash from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of  in in our capital spending was million compared to million in in  proceeds from sale of retail operations in georgia and the kershaw quarries totaled million 
cash from financing activities 
financing activities used million in compared to million provided by financing activities in in our line of credit was reduced by million and million was paid on our long term note 
this compares to a million increase under our line of credit less million paid on our long term debt in in we also had  in cash provided from employees exercising stock options which was offset by increased debt issuance costs of  associated with the renewal of our credit facility 
cash flow from discontinued operations 
the cash flow from discontinued operations are included in the cash flow from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
if stated separately  the net cash flow from discontinued operations was an increase of  made up of  provided by operations   provided by investing activities and  used in financing activities 
in the net cash flow used in discontinued operations was  made up of  provided by operations   used in investing activities and  used in financing activities 
the absence of cash flows due to discontinued operations is not expected to significantly affect the company s future liquidity or capital resources 
credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit and chittenden trust company lenders that is scheduled to expire in october and is secured by substantially all assets of the company located in the united states 
the facility consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
amounts outstanding were  and  as of december  and  and  as of december   on the revolving credit facility and the term loan line of credit  respectively 
availability under the revolving credit facility was  as of december  the weighted average interest rate was and on the revolving credit facility in and  respectively 
the credit facility loan agreement places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  repurchase stock and make investments or guarantees  without pre approval by the lenders 
the credit facility agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company 
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility requires the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  to the sum of income taxes paid  capital expenditures  interest and scheduled debt repayments be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter through december  and beginning with the first quarter of primarily as a result of operating losses in and first quarter  we had been in violation of this covenant and had received waivers and amendments of this covenant from the lenders 
the company was in compliance with the ratio covenant  at december  total liabilities to net worth ratio 
our credit facility also requires that the ratio of our total liabilities to net worth the leverage ratio not exceed the leverage ratio excludes from the calculation the change in tangible net worth directly resulting from the company s compliance with sfas no 
of million 
in relevant part  sfas no 
required us to place on our books certain unrecognized and unfunded retirement liabilities as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant 
interest rates 
we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with the lenders 
we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio 
based on this ratio  our current rates are basis points higher than the lowest incremental rates currently available to us 
the rates in effect as of december  were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility million prime revolving credit facility million libor pts 
term loan a million libor pts 
canadian credit facility the company s canadian subsidiary has a line of credit agreement with the royal bank of canada that is renewable annually 
under the terms of this agreement  a maximum of million cdn may be advanced based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  and tangible fixed assets 
the line of credit bears interest at the us prime rate 
there was  cdn and outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  and we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern areas generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set under those conditions 
in addition  we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to adverse weather conditions 
as a result  we have historically incurred a net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas  as issued  are effective for the fiscal years beginning after november  however  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no

fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope 
we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 

this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
amends previous guidance to extend the use of the fair value option to available for sale and held to maturity securities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas no 

this statement improves the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
it establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination
