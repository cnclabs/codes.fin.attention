item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are substantially owned by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds  individual investors or are family owned businesses  with a particular focus on senior notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of the act 
in addition  for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ric under the internal revenue code  as amended the code 
we seek out small and medium sized private us businesses that meet certain criteria  including some but not all of the following the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering of the borrower s stock or by exercising our right to require the borrower to repurchase our warrants  though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
business environment the united states has entered into an economic downturn 
the economic downturn generally and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular have decreased liquidity and increased our cost of debt and equity capital  where available 
the longer these conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could continue to increase our cost and significantly limit our access to debt and equity capital  and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
many of the companies in which we have made or will make investments may also be susceptible to the economic downturn  which may affect the ability of one or more of our portfolio companies to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
an economic downturn could also disproportionately impact some of the industries in which we invest  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio 
therefore  the number of our non performing assets are likely to increase and the fair market value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
the economic downturn has affected the availability of credit generally and may prevent us from replacing or renewing our credit facility on reasonable terms  if at all 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  we may experience difficulty in raising capital 
challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing our credit facility that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to maintain our qualification as ric  we must satisfy  among other requirements  an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
because we are required to distribute our income in this manner  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage such as borrowings under our line of credit 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act  which require us to have a asset coverage ratio  meaning generally that for every dollar of debt  we must have two dollars of assets 
recent market conditions have also affected the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
on november   the closing market price of our common stock was  which price represented a discount to our september  net asset value nav per share 
when our stock is trading below nav  as it has consistently traded subsequent to september   our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act which generally prohibit us from the issuance and sale of our common stock below nav per share without stockholder approval other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering 
we currently do not have stockholder approval to sell our common stock below nav  however our stockholders will consider a proposal which would allow us to do so at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february  the economic downturn may also continue to decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our equity investments  which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
for the year ended september   we recorded net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio of investments of million  which was mainly attributable to the decrease in fair value of our portfolio 
we may see further decreases in the value of our portfolio  which will further limit our ability to borrow under our current credit facility 
additionally  our credit facility contains covenants regarding the maintenance of certain minimum net worth requirements which are affected by the decrease in value of our portfolio 
failure to meet these requirements would result in a default which  if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  would result in the acceleration of our repayment obligations under the credit facility 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  debt and equity capital may be costly or difficult for us to raise for some time 
for so long as this is the case  our near term strategy may necessarily become somewhat dependent upon retaining capital and building the value of our existing portfolio companies to further the potential of future returns 
we will also  where prudent and possible  consider the sale of lower yielding investments 
we expect that this may result in significantly reduced investment activity  as our ability to make new investments under such conditions would be dependent on availability of proceeds from the sale or exit of existing portfolio investments  which events may be beyond our control 
with available capital  we intend to continue our strategy of making conservative investments in businesses that we believe will weather the current economy and that are likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
investment highlights during the fiscal year ended september   we extended  directly or through participations  approximately million of new loans to new portfolio companies  and million of investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws or the additions of term notes  for total new investments of million 
also  during the fiscal year ended september   four borrowers repaid their loans in full ahead of contractual maturity  two borrowers made unscheduled partial payoffs  we had a partial sale of a syndicated loan  and we were repaid in full on another syndicated loan of an aggregate of million  and we received scheduled contractual principal repayments of approximately million  for total principal repayments of approximately million 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to  or investments in  portfolio companies for a total of approximately million  before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures 
investment strategy our loans typically range from million to million  although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes  generally mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates 
some of our loans may contain a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik interest and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
we seek to avoid pik interest with all potential investments under review 
as of september  one control investment bore pik interest 
because the majority of our portfolio loans consist of term debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were rated  and thus cannot determine whether or not they could be considered investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
original issue discount oid arises when we extend a loan and receive an equity interest in the borrower at the same time 
to the extent that the price paid for the equity is not at market value  we must allocate part of the price paid for the loan  to the value of the equity 
then the amount allocated to the equity  the oid  must be amortized over the life of the loan 
as with pik interest  the amortization of oid also produces income that must be recognized for purposes of satisfying the distribution requirements for a regulated investment company ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of the code  whereas the cash is received  if at all  when the equity instrument is sold 
we seek to avoid oid with all potential investments under review and from inception through september   we did not hold any investments with oid income 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
our investment adviser  gladstone management corporation the adviser provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser receives fees for other services it provides to our portfolio companies 
these other fees are typically non recurring  are recognized as revenue when earned and are generally paid directly to our adviser by the borrower or potential borrower upon closing of the investment 
the services our adviser provides to portfolio companies vary by investment  but generally include a broad array of services  such as investment banking services  arranging bank and equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  raising equity and debt capital from other investors  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
when our adviser receives fees for these services  of certain of those fees are credited against the base management fee that we pay to our adviser 
any services of this nature subsequent to closing would typically generate a separate fee at the time of completion 
our adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to our adviser throughout the life of the investment 
fees of this nature are recorded as revenue by our adviser when earned and are not credited against the base management fee 
we may receive fees for the origination and closing services we provide to portfolio companies through our adviser 
these fees are paid directly to us and are recognized as revenue upon closing of the originated investment and are reported as fee income in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including  but not limited to  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business  reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan  and the receipt of all necessary consents 
upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower generally pays the adviser a non refundable fee for services rendered by the adviser through the date of the non binding term sheet 
these fees are received by the adviser and are offset against the base management fee payable to the adviser  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by the adviser 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the transaction  including legal fees 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by the adviser in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to the adviser 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized in the period in which such reimbursement is received  however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements

investment advisory and management agreement under the amended and restated investment advisory agreement amended advisory agreement  we pay our adviser an annual base management fee of of our average gross assets  which is defined as total assets less cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors calculated as of the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and also consists of a two part incentive fee 
the first part of the incentive fee is an income based incentive fee which rewards our adviser if our quarterly net investment income before giving effect to any incentive fee exceeds of our net assets the hurdle rate

net unrealized depreciation on derivative during the year ended september   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of due to a decrease in the fair market value of our interest rate cap agreement  as compared to unrealized depreciation of during the year ended september  net unrealized depreciation on investments for the year ended september   we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments of  as compared to net unrealized depreciation of  for the year ended september  the unrealized depreciation is mainly attributable to the decrease in fair value of our portfolio  most notably in the following investments localtel  greatwide logistics services  us healthcare and visual edge technology 
we believe that our investment portfolio was valued at a depreciated value due primarily to the general instability of the loan markets and  to a lesser extent  the use of a modified valuation procedure for our non control non affiliate investments 
previously  we valued the debt portion of bundled debt and equity investments in non controlled companies in accordance with board approved valuation procedures  which valued the debt securities at the contractual principal balance 
consistent with the board s ongoing review and analysis of appropriate valuation procedures  and in consideration of the fair value measurements of sfas no 
which we will be required to adopt on october   the board of directors modified our valuation procedure so that the debt portion of bundled investments in non controlled companies is based on opinions of value provided by spse 
this change in valuation estimate accounted for  or  of the net unrealized depreciation for the year long period 
although our investment portfolio has depreciated  our entire portfolio was fair valued at of cost as of september  the unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders  however  it may be an indication of future realized losses  which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution

net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  for the purchase of the us treasury bill

net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  and mainly consisted of net borrowings on our line of credit of  proceeds of  net of offering costs  from the issuance of common stock and the payment of  of dividends 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  and consisted of  of repayments on our line of credit  and  for the payment of dividends 
these outflows were partially offset by approximately  of cash received from borrowings on the line of credit and the exercise of stock options for  dividends in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid monthly cash dividends of per common share during each month of the fiscal years ended september  and september  and per common share for each month of october through june and per common share for july  august and september for the year ended september   our dividends paid of  exceeded our net investment income by  we declared these dividends based on our estimates of net investment income for the fiscal year 
our investment pace was slower than expected and  consequently  our net investment income was lower than our original estimates 
a portion of the dividends declared during fiscal was treated as a return of capital to our stockholders 
issuance of equity on may   we filed a registration statement with the sec as amended in december which was declared effective on january  the registration statement 
the registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock and or debt securities 
to date  we have issued million in common stock pursuant to the registration statement  which leaves a remaining capacity of million 
to date  we have incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the registration statement 
we anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future 
however  we cannot determine the terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
additionally  when our common stock is trading below net asset value nav  we will have regulatory constraints under the act on our ability to obtain additional capital in this manner 
generally  the act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our nav per share  other than to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering  without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors 
as of september   our nav per share was and our closing market price was per share 
however  subsequent to that date our stock has consistently traded at discounts of up to of our september  nav per share 
on november   our closing market price was per share 
to the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our nav per share  we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock  other than pursuant to a rights offering 
the asset coverage requirement of a bdc under the act effectively limits our ratio of debt to equity to to the extent that we are unable to raise capital through the issuance of equity  our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt may also be inhibited to the extent of our regulatory debt to equity ratio limits 
on october   we completed an offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  less an underwriting discount of per share  under the registration statement and as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement dated october  on november   the underwriter exercised its over allotment option and we sold an additional  shares of common stock at the same price 
net proceeds of the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us  were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on february   we completed an offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  less an underwriting discount of per share  under the registration statement and as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement dated january  on february   the underwriter exercised its over allotment option and we sold an additional  shares of common stock at the same price 
net proceeds of the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us  were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on february   our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us to offer and issue long term rights  including warrants  to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price that  at the time such rights are issued  will not be less than the greater of the market value of our common stock or the nav of our common stock 
such rights may be part of or accompanied by other securities of ours such as convertible debt 
we have determined that it would be advantageous to have the ability to sell  either alone or as part of another security  warrants  options or rights to purchase common stock in connection with our financing and capital raising activities 
this ability may give us a cost effective way to raise capital 
we believe that the rights to purchase shares of our common stock give us additional flexibility over and above the limited amount that can be raised without stockholder approval through short term transferable rights offering to take advantage of investment opportunities that may arise in the future 
additionally  listed for a vote at the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for february   is a proposal which  if approved  would authorize us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current net asset value per share for a period of one year  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
revolving credit facility through our wholly owned subsidiary  business loan  we have a million revolving credit facility the db facility with deutsche bank ag  as administrative agent 
pursuant to the db facility  business loan has pledged the loans it holds to secure future advances by certain institutional lenders 
the interest rate charged on the advances under the db facility is based on the commercial paper cp rate  which is equivalent to the weighted average per annum rates paid by the db facility s cp lenders in respect of cp notes issued by the cp lender during such period 
business loan also has the ability to borrow at an alternative rate from the committed lenders if cp lenders are unable to fund advances 
the alternative rate is the london interbank offered rate libor  or if libor is unavailable  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
in february  we increased the db facility from million to million and in april  increased the db facility to million and added branch banking and trust company bb t as a committed lender 
in june  we renewed the db facility  which matures on may  in the event that the db facility is not renewed or extended  we will be required to repay all principal and accrued interest outstanding within one year of the maturity date 
as of september   the outstanding principal balance under the db facility was approximately  at an interest rate of approximately plus a program fee 
we are also charged an unused commitment fee of per annum 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed by deutsche bank ag  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans are added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are early prepayment or are made as contractually required 
at september   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the db facility was approximately  the db facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
the facility also restricts some of the terms and provisions including interest rates  terms to maturity and payments schedules and limits the borrower and industry concentrations of loans that are eligible to secure advances 
as of september   business loan was in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
the administrative agent also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with the bank of new york mellon corp 
as custodian 
deutsche bank ag is also the trustee of the account and once a month remits the collected funds to us 
at september  and september   the amount due from custodian was  and  respectively 
our adviser also services the loans pledged under the db facility 
as a condition to this servicing arrangement  we executed a performance guaranty pursuant to which we guaranteed that our adviser would comply fully with all of its obligations under the facility 
the performance guaranty requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of million plus of equity issued after may and to maintain asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act 
as of september   we were in compliance with our covenants under the performance guaranty 
contractual obligations as of september   we were not party to any signed and non binding term sheets 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k as of september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we have identified our investment valuation process  tax status and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting policies 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
investment valuation policy we carry our investments at market value to the extent that market quotations are readily available  and otherwise at fair value  as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
in determining the fair value of our investments  our adviser has established an investment valuation policy the policy 
the policy has been approved by our board of directors and each quarter the board of directors reviews whether our adviser has applied the policy consistently  and votes whether or not to accept the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
we use generally accepted valuation techniques to value our portfolio unless we have specific information about the value of an investment to determine otherwise 
from time to time we may accept an appraisal of a business in which we hold securities 
these appraisals are expensive and occur infrequently but provide a third party valuation opinion that may differ in results  techniques and scopes used to value our investments 
when these specific third party valuations are engaged or accepted  we would use such appraisals to value the investment we have in that business if we determined that the appraisals were the best estimate of fair value 
the policy  which is summarized below  applies to the following categories of securities publicly traded securities  securities for which a limited market exists  and securities for which no market exists 
valuation methods publicly traded securities we determine the value of publicly traded securities based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed and primarily traded on the valuation date 
to the extent that we own restricted securities that are not freely tradable  but for which a public market otherwise exists  we will use the market value of that security adjusted for any decrease in value resulting from the restrictive feature 
securities for which a limited market exists we value securities that are not traded on an established secondary securities market  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in  or assignments of  syndicated loans  at the quoted bid price 
firm bid prices are requested  however  if a firm bid price is unavailable  we base the value of the security upon the indicative bid price offered by the respective originating syndication agent s trading desk  or secondary desk  on or near the valuation date 
to the extent that we use the indicative bid price as a basis for valuing the security  our adviser may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the policy 
securities for which no market exists the valuation methodology for securities for which no market exists falls into three categories portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities  portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities  and portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities 
portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities debt securities that are not publicly traded on an established securities market  or for which a limited market does not exist non public debt securities  and that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity  or equity like securities  are fair valued in accordance with the terms of the policy  which utilizes opinions of value submitted to us by spse 
we may also submit pik interest to spse for their evaluation when it is determined the pik interest is likely to be received 
in the case of non public debt securities  we have engaged spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies in which we own no equity  or equity like securities 
spse s opinions of value are based on the valuations prepared by our portfolio management team as described below 
we request that spse also evaluate and assign values to success fees conditional interest included in some loan securities when we determine that the probability of receiving a success fee on a given loan is above  a threshold of significance 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which we specifically request evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments which may include the information described below under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described below under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described hereunder  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity  or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with our adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
our adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when our adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment  our adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether our adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
our adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the schedule of investments as of september  included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  management makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy using the methods described herein 
portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities we value non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities eg preferred equity  equity  or other equity like securities that are purchased together as part of a package  where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security  both the debt and equity securities of the portfolio investment would exit in the mergers and acquisition market as the principal market  generally through a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
under this approach  we first calculate the total enterprise value of the issuer by incorporating some or all of the following factors the issuer s ability to make payments  the earnings of the issuer  recent sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities  and discounted cash flow or other pertinent factors 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  we may reference industry statistics and use outside experts 
once we have estimated the total enterprise value of the issuer  we subtract the value of all the debt securities of the issuer  which are valued at the contractual principal balance 
fair values of these debt securities are discounted for any shortfall of total enterprise value over the total debt outstanding for the issuer 
once the values for all outstanding senior securities which include the debt securities have been subtracted from the total enterprise value of the issuer  the remaining amount  if any  is used to determine the value of the issuer s equity or equity like securities 
portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities we value non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities that are purchased together from the same non controlled portfolio company  or issuer  by valuing the debt portion with spse as described above and valuing the equity portion based on the total enterprise value of the issuer  which is calculated using a liquidity waterfall approach as described above 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security in an arms length transaction in the security s principal market 
valuation considerations from time to time  depending on certain circumstances  the adviser may use the following valuation considerations  including  but not limited to the risk rating of the security see loan grading and risk rating  the cost basis and the type of the security  the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and discounted cash flow  reports from portfolio company senior management and board meetings  reported values of similar securities of the portfolio company or comparable companies  changes in the economy affecting the portfolio company  and other third party appraisals of the portfolio companies 
credit information our adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we and our adviser participate in the periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold control and affiliate investments and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements and board discussions  our adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures above  we risk rate all of our investments in debt securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by a nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  we use the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  we use a proprietary risk rating system 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which we do not use a third party nrsro risk rating  we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by a nrsro 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as a nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because our system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
we believe our risk rating would be significantly higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  our risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when we use our risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the primary difference between our risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that our risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that we believe are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on a nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from a nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on our scale is equal to a bbb on a nrsro scale 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro gladstone capital s description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years  then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period  which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
at september   three investments were on non accrual and at september   one investment was on non accrual 
we do not risk rate our equity securities

as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
we have a policy to pay out as a dividend up to of that amount 
in an effort to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
at september   three investments were on non accrual for approximately million  at cost 
at september   one investment was on non accrual for approximately million  at cost 
conditional interest or a success fee is recorded when earned upon full repayment of a loan investment 
paid in kind interest in the past  some loans in our portfolio contained a pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
as of september   one loan in our portfolio bore pik interest 
services provided to portfolio companies as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
we provide these services through our adviser  who provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for such managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser receives fees for the other services it provides to our portfolio companies 
these other fees are typically non recurring  are recognized as revenue when earned and are generally paid directly to our adviser by the borrower or potential borrower upon the closing of the investment 
the services our adviser provides to our portfolio companies vary by investment  but generally include a broad array of services such as investment banking services  arranging bank and equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  restructuring existing investments  raising equity and debt capital  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
effective april   when our adviser receives fees for these services  of certain of those fees are credited against the base management fee that we pay to our adviser  whereas prior to such date fees were credited 
any services of this nature subsequent to the closing would typically generate a separate fee at the time of completion 
our adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to our adviser throughout the life of the investment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
while we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates  currently substantially all of our investment portfolio is at variable rates 
at september   our portfolio consisted of the following variable rates with a floor variable rates with a floor and ceiling variable rates without a floor or ceiling fixed rate total all of our variable rate loans have rates associated with either the current libor or prime rate 
we have a million revolving credit facility  based on variable rates  with deutsche bank ag which matures in may as of september   there was an outstanding principal balance of million at a stated interest rate of approximately plus a program fee 
in february  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in order to fulfill an obligation under our line of credit to enter into certain hedging transactions in connection with our borrowings under the line of credit 
we purchased this interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million which is amortized quarterly for a one time  up front payment of the interest rate cap agreement entitles us to receive payments  if any  equal to the amount by which interest payments on the current notional amount at one month libor exceed the payments on the current notional amount at 
the cap expires in february this interest rate cap agreement effectively caps our interest payments on our line of credit borrowing  up to the notional amount of the interest rate cap  at 
this mitigates our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on our line of credit  which are at variable rates 
at september   the cap agreement had a nominal fair market value and a current notional amount of million 
the one month libor rate in effect on our investment portfolio at september  was approximately 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond the interest rate cap agreement are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
basis point change increase decrease in interest income increase decrease in interest expense net increase in net assets resulting from operations up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in the event that we securitize a portion of our loan portfolio  we believe that we will likely be required to enter into further hedging arrangements in the future with respect to securitized loans 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
we currently do not anticipate investing in debt or equity of foreign companies  however  some potential portfolio companies may have operations located outside the united states 
these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
