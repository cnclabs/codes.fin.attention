item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the other information appearing in this report 
overview we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
our strategy is to grow through exploration  exploitation and development projects we believe to be relatively low risk and through selective acquisitions of underdeveloped properties 
pursuit of this strategy has led to increases in our oil and natural gas production and our proved reserves in each of the past three years 
our average net production increased from  boe d in to  boe d in calculated as described in footnote to the table included in results of operations and to  boe d in our proved reserves increased from mmboe at december  to mmboe at december  and to mmboe at december  in the execution of our strategy  our management is principally focused on increasing our reserves of oil and natural gas and on increasing annual production through exploration  exploitation and development activities and acquisitions 
our management is also focused on the risks and opportunities associated with current oil and natural gas prices  which remain high compared to longer term historical averages  and on the goal of maximizing production rates while operating in a safe manner 
capital expenditures we have developed an active capital expenditure program to take advantage of our extensive inventory of drilling prospects and other projects 
our exploration  exploitation and development capital expenditures  including amounts accrued and unpaid at december   were million in  up from million in  and we expect that they will be approximately million in we expect to spend approximately of the budgeted amount on projects in the sacramento basin  in the coastal california region and in texas 
included in the budget is million for exploration projects 
the aggregate levels of capital expenditures for  and the allocation of those expenditures  are dependent on a variety of factors  including the availability of capital resources to fund the expenditures and changes in our business assessments as to where our capital can be most profitably employed 
accordingly  the actual levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of those expenditures may vary materially from our estimates 
the following summarizes certain significant aspects of our capital spending program in and coastal california exploitation and development in the coastal california area  we drilled five new wells in including one higher impact exploration well  all of which were productive 
we also performed eleven workovers and recompletions 
in  we plan to drill three wells and perform five workovers and recompletions in the area 
our primary focus is on development activities in the west montalvo field 
since acquiring the field in may  we have drilled one well and initiated an aggressive workover  recompletion and return to production program on existing wells  a program that included eight workovers in we plan to continue the program in and to drill two to three new development wells in the field  including one offshore well which will be drilled from an onshore location 
we also plan to commission a seismic survey to assist in designing and optimizing an infill development program 
in the sockeye field  we continue to implement our waterflood program from platform gail and are working on the evaluation and design of a possible expansion of the program 
we are also continuing to evaluate a possible expansion of our horizontal and multi lateral well drilling activities to the monterey formation in the field 
in the santa clara field  we pursued a plan to return platform grace to production in  redrilling three wells with limited success 
further drilling from the platform has been suspended pending additional geologic and engineering review 
in the south ellwood field  the permitting process continues for our full field development project 
key components of the project include an extension of our current field area which would effectively double the size of the existing field and the installation of an onshore oil transport pipeline to replace the existing barge 
development of the extended lease area can be accomplished from our existing platform  platform holly 
we anticipate receiving the draft environmental impact report for this project in the first half of with project approval and startup expected in sacramento basin exploitation and development in the sacramento basin  we continue to pursue our infill drilling program in the greater grimes and willows fields 
we drilled wells in the basin in of which were productive and performed workovers and recompletions 
of the completed wells  were drilled to non proved locations and are therefore considered exploratory wells as defined in sec regulation s x  we consider two of those wells to be higher impact exploration wells 
we currently have five drilling rigs and five workover completion rigs working in the basin and expect to drill over new wells and perform more than workovers and recompletions there in as of december   we had identified drilling locations in the basin  and we anticipate identifying additional locations as we pursue exploitation and development opportunities there 
we continue to test and evaluate potential downspacing opportunities in the basin as well as new methods of improving productivity and reducing drilling costs 
in particular  we have initiated a hydraulic fracturing program targeting the forbes and deeper formations  a program that could potentially enhance production and reserves significantly 
the strategy of using hydraulic fracturing to enhance oil and natural gas production and recovery is a well established and proven process  although we have not used it in our existing completions and  to our knowledge  it has not been widely used in the basin by other operators 
we initiated a fracture stimulation program by testing the process on three wells in november although the production history on the three test wells is limited  early indications of the potential from fracturing are encouraging 
we currently plan to perform between and fractures in  but this estimate could change significantly depending on the success of the program 
as of december   our acreage position in the basin had grown to approximately  net acres  gross 
texas exploitation and development in texas  we drilled nine new wells in  all of which were productive  and performed workovers and recompletions 
in  we plan to drill five wells and perform over workovers and recompletions there 
our focus in texas has been on the redevelopment of the hastings complex 
this program has consisted principally of returning idle wells to production  increasing the lift capacity of existing wells  working over and recompleting existing wells in different producing sands  significantly upgrading surface facility fluid handling capacity and increasing water injection capabilities 
in addition  we drilled five infill replacement wells in the hastings complex in  targeting unswept and undepleted sands 
in  we expect to continue our workover and recompletion program in an effort to further increase production and reserves 
we also will focus on lowering operating expenses in as we reduce our remediation and redevelopment activities at the complex 
we also initiated a workover and recompletion program in the manvel field  which produces from the same formation and exhibits operating characteristics that are similar to those of the hastings complex 
in  we performed workovers and recompletions and focused on upgrading facilities to handle greater production volumes 
in  we plan to accelerate our workover program and to drill up to three development wells 
our plans in texas for also include drilling two to three additional development wells in some of our other fields to demonstrate and assess new exploitation opportunities 
higher impact exploration activities in addition to the exploitation and development activities described above  we devoted approximately million to higher impact exploration activities in  including million on drilling 
we generally consider a well to be a higher impact exploration well when it is either a new field wildcat or a new pool test ie  a well on a structural feature or other type of trap already producing oil or natural gas but outside the known limits of the producing area 
we drilled three higher impact exploration wells in  all of which were productive 
in  we expect to drill as many as fifteen higher impact exploration wells  including ten in the sacramento basin  three in coastal california and two in texas 
we generally pursue higher impact exploration activities in areas where we have a strong operating base  proprietary knowledge and a well established land position 
acquisitions and divestitures west montalvo and manvel acquisitions 
we acquired the west montalvo field in ventura county  california in may for approximately million 
we acquired the manvel field in brazoria county  texas  and certain other fields in texas  in april for million 
texcal transaction 
we acquired texcal energy lp llc on march  for million in cash 
in order to finance the purchase price for the acquisition and related transaction costs of approximately million  we borrowed approximately million under our revolving credit facility and million under our second lien term loan facility 
other 
we have an active acreage acquisition program and we regularly engage in acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  dispositions of oil and natural gas properties  primarily in and around our existing core areas of operations  including several transactions in each of  and trends affecting our results of operations expected production 
we expect that the execution of our capital expenditure program in will result in increases in our average net production from each of our operating areas 
our coastal california properties  which produced mboe during of which was oil  will continue to be the largest contributor of production in at our newest coastal california property  the west montalvo field  we expect the drilling and workover recompletion programs we began there in to result in production increases in in the sacramento basin  we intend to continue our multi year drilling program and plan to drill approximately new wells and perform over workovers and recompletions 
in the hastings complex  we expect further production increases in as a result of the enhancement of our water processing and injection capabilities and the continuation of our workover and recompletion program 
at the manvel field  which we acquired in april  we are implementing a similar redevelopment program to increase production by upgrading our fluid handling and injection capacity and performing several workovers and recompletions 
our expectations with respect to future production rates are subject to a number of uncertainties  including those associated with third party services  oil and natural gas prices  events resulting in unexpected downtime  permitting issues  drilling success rates  pipeline capacity  and other factors  including those referenced in risk factors 
production expenses 
production expenses averaged per boe in compared to per boe in the production expenses reflect our continued workover program in the hastings complex and operating expenses from the west montalvo and manvel fields  where expenses increased as remedial efforts accelerated in both fields 
these efforts  coupled with a production curtailment at west montalvo for facility vessel inspections and repairs  resulted in an increase in production expenses per boe 
we expect our production expenses to decrease on a boe basis for as a whole due to reduced remedial activities in the hastings complex and production volume increases from the sacramento basin  the west montalvo and manvel fields and the hastings complex 
our expectations with respect to future per unit expenses are based in part on the projected increases in our production and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those described and referenced in the preceding paragraph 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were per boe in  excluding per boe charges under sfas r of 
this represented a decrease from per boe g a costs of excluding sfas r charges of in the change resulted from an overall increase in g a costs in the period being more than offset by production growth and the effect of an increase in the g a costs that were capitalized as a result of being directly related to our development  exploitation  exploration and acquisition efforts 
excluding sfas r charges  we expect our g a costs to be similar to our full year costs on a per boe basis 
as with production expenses  our expectations in this regard are based in part on our projected increases in production  which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
unrealized derivative gains and losses 
rising oil prices led to substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in  while fluctuating oil prices and lower natural gas prices led to unrealized commodity derivative gains in these unrealized gains and losses resulted from mark to market valuations of derivative positions that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges and are reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in our income statement 
payments actually due to or from counterparties in the future on these derivatives will typically be offset by corresponding changes in prices ultimately received from the sale of our production 
we may incur significant gains or losses of this type in and in subsequent years 
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we discontinued hedge accounting as of april  this may increase volatility in gains and losses of this type in subsequent periods 
we may also have significant unrealized interest rate derivative gains and losses in subsequent periods due to changes in market interest rates

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues 
oil and natural gas revenues increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in production and a increase in average sales prices as described below 
oil revenues increased by million in to million compared to million in oil production rose  with production of  mbbl in compared to  mbbl in the production increase was attributable primarily to the acquisition of the texcal properties in march  the manvel field in april and the west montalvo field in may  and to our workover program in the hastings complex 
our average realized price for oil increased to per bbl for the period 
natural gas revenues increased million in to million compared to million in natural gas production increased  with production of  mmcf compared to  mmcf in the increase was due primarily to drilling and recompletion activities in the sacramento basin and production attributable to the march texcal acquisition  offset by decreases in natural gas production at the south ellwood field and the santa clara federal unit 
our average realized price for natural gas increased to per mcf for the period 
commodity derivatives and other revenues 
the following table sets forth the components of commodity derivative losses  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated in thousands years ended december  realized commodity derivative losses   unrealized commodity derivative gains losses   amortization of derivative premiums and other comprehensive loss total   realized commodity derivative gains or losses represent the difference between the strike prices in the contracts settled during the period and the ultimate settlement prices 
the realized commodity derivative losses in and reflect the settlement of contracts at prices above the relevant strike prices 
unrealized commodity derivative gains losses represent the change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts from period to period 
the change in unrealized commodity derivative gains losses reflects an increase in the notional volumes under derivative contracts outstanding in and an increase in the futures prices used to estimate the fair value of those contracts at the end of the period 
derivative premiums are amortized over the term of the underlying derivative contracts 
the increase in amortization of derivative premiums and other comprehensive losses in reflects additional premiums paid in connection with the additional contracts outstanding in and amortization of other comprehensive losses beginning in the second quarter of other revenue decreased  from million in to million in the change was primarily due to lower transportation income received from purchasers of oil production from the south ellwood field 
production expenses 
production expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to production expenses attributable to the texcal  manvel and west montalvo acquisitions and an increase in the number of producing wells at other venoco properties 
on a per unit basis  costs increased per boe from per boe in to per boe in  primarily due to remedial activities in the hastings complex and at the manvel and west montalvo fields 
transportation expenses 
transportation expenses increased  from million in to million in this was primarily attributable to increased transportation costs for barge deliveries 
on a per boe basis  transportation expenses increased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a 
dd a expense increased million to million in from million in dd a expense per boe rose  from per boe in to per boe in the increase was primarily due to a higher depletion expense resulting from the increase in the oil and natural gas property cost as a result of the texcal  manvel and west montalvo acquisitions and the increase in oil and natural gas property costs during the year resulting from our capital expenditure program 
accretion of abandonment liability 
accretion expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to accretion from the properties acquired in the texcal  manvel and west montalvo acquisitions and from new wells drilled and completed in the second half of and in general and administrative g a 
g a expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from increases in our professional staff and related infrastructure costs  non recurring charges of million for the settlement of employment contracts in and a million increase in non cash sfas r share based compensation expense in these increases were partially offset by an increase in the g a costs that were capitalized for payroll and related overhead for activities that are directly related to our development  exploitation  exploration and acquisition efforts 
on a per boe basis  g a expenses decreased  from in to in financing costs and other 
financing costs and other increased million to million in from million in interest expense  net of interest income  increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding in amortization of deferred loan costs increased million  from million in to million in  because the total reflects a full year of amortization of loan costs related to our second lien term loan facility compared to nine months of amortization in the debt was initially incurred on march  
changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap derivative instruments resulted in unrealized losses of million in and million in the change between years is the result of an increase in the notional amount of debt covered by the interest rate swap and a decrease in estimated interest rates used to determine the fair value of the derivative instruments 
we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in the second quarter of when we prepaid the prior second lien term loan facility and replaced it with the new term loan facility 
we paid a premium of million and wrote off related deferred loan costs of million in connection with the prepayment of the prior term loan facility 
income tax expense 
the loss before taxes in resulted in an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of million in net income loss 
our net loss for was million compared to net income of million in the change between periods is the result of the items discussed above 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues 
oil and natural gas revenues increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to production attributable to the texcal acquisition and higher realized oil prices  partially offset by a decrease in production from other venoco properties 
the decline in production volumes from other venoco properties was the result of i the effect of our sale  on march   of the big mineral creek field in grayson county  texas which averaged net production of boe d in the first quarter of  i high initial production rates in early from new offshore oil wells which had recently come on line at that time and iii the effect of maintenance projects in the third quarter and early fourth quarter of  which limited production volumes in those periods 
oil revenues increased by million from million in to million in oil production rose  with production of  mbbl in compared to  mbbl in the production increase was attributable to the texcal properties acquired in march  partially offset by an decline in production volumes from other venoco properties 
the decline in production from other venoco properties resulted from the factors discussed above 
our average realized price for oil increased to per bbl for the period 
natural gas revenues increased million from million in to million in natural gas production increased  with production of  mmcf compared to  mmcf in the majority of the increase was due to production attributable to the texcal properties acquired in march production increased approximately as a result of increased production from other venoco properties 
the increased production from other venoco properties relates to our ongoing field development activities 
our average realized price for natural gas decreased to per mcf for the period 
commodity derivatives and other revenues 
the following table sets forth the components of commodity derivative losses  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  realized commodity derivative losses   unrealized commodity derivative gains losses   amortization of derivative premiums and other comprehensive loss total   realized commodity derivative gains or losses represent the difference between the strike prices in the contracts settled during the period and the ultimate settlement prices 
the realized commodity derivative losses in and reflect the settlement of contracts at prices above the relevant strike prices 
unrealized commodity derivative gains losses represent the change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts from period to period 
the change in unrealized commodity derivative gains losses reflects an increase in the notional volumes under derivative contracts outstanding in and a net decrease in the futures prices used to estimate the fair value of those contracts at the end of the period 
derivative premiums are amortized over the term of the underlying derivative contracts 
the increase in amortization of derivative premiums and other comprehensive losses in reflects additional premiums paid in connection with the additional contracts outstanding in the decrease in total commodity derivative losses in resulted primarily from the non recurrence in of the significant increases in commodity prices that occurred in other revenue increased  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to revenues of million from a pipeline we acquired in the fourth quarter of production expenses 
production expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to production expenses attributable to the texcal properties acquired in march and a increase in production expenses from other venoco properties 
the increase in production expenses for other venoco properties relates to an increase in the number of producing wells  normal variances of timing of production expenses  including expenses relating to periodic maintenance projects  and increased costs of third party services 
on a per unit basis  costs increased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in a significant part of this increase was attributable to remedial work projects performed in the hastings complex in the second half of the year 
per unit production expenses attributable to the texcal properties rose from per boe in to per boe in primarily as a result of those projects 
in addition  production expenses on a per unit basis for other venoco properties increased in due primarily to increased costs of services 
transportation expenses 
transportation expenses increased  from million in to million in this was primarily attributable to volume increases 
on a per boe basis  transportation expenses decreased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a 
dd a expense increased million from million in to million in dd a expense rose per boe  from per boe in to per boe in the increase was primarily due to a higher depletion expense resulting from the increase in oil and natural gas property costs as a result of the march texcal acquisition and an increase in future development costs 
accretion of abandonment liability 
accretion expense increased million from million in to million in the increase was due to accretion from the acquired texcal properties and from new wells drilled and completed in general and administrative g a 
g a expense increased million from million in to million in g a expense rose per boe  from per boe in to per boe in the increase resulted primarily from increases in our professional staff and related infrastructure costs  non cash sfas r share based compensation expense of million in  million in direct costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance activities and other indirect costs for internal systems and process conversions  and million in expenses related to texcal transition and integration activities 
financing costs and other 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million from million in to million in amortization of deferred loan costs increased million from million in to million in we incurred million in unrealized losses in from changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap derivative instruments as a result of a decrease in estimated interest rates used to determine the fair value of the derivative instruments 
the changes were primarily due to debt incurred in march to acquire texcal 
income tax expense 
income tax expense in was million compared to million for the change was due to an increase in income 
our effective tax rate decreased from for to for due to an increase of business activity in lower taxing jurisdictions 
net income 
net income for was million as compared to net income of million in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows years ended december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   net cash provided by operating activities was million in  up from million in and million in cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted in and by increases in commodity prices and production from properties acquired in those years and our development program 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the primary investing activities in include million in expenditures for oil and gas properties and million paid to acquire the west montalvo and manvel fields and other properties 
the primary investing activities in include million paid in cash to acquire texcal net of texcal cash and million in expenditures for oil and gas properties 
the primary investing activities in were million used to develop and acquire oil and natural gas properties  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and net cash used in financing activities of million in the primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the second lien term loan facility to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs and million in net borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
net proceeds from an additional offering of common stock completed in july were million  of which million was used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  the remainder was used to fund our capital expenditure program 
proceeds from long term debt in included million borrowed under the prior term loan facility and million in net borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which amounts were primarily used to fund the acquisition of texcal and million in loan costs 
net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in november were million  of which million and million were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the second lien term loan facility  respectively 
other net borrowings in under the revolving credit facility of million were used to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs 
net cash used in financing activities in related primarily to the payment of a million dividend to our then sole stockholder  million used to purchase the interests of minority stockholders and principal repayments on long term debt of million  partially offset by million in new borrowings under our credit agreement 
capital resources and requirements we plan to make substantial capital expenditures in the future for the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
we expect that our exploration  exploitation and development capital expenditures  which were million in  will be approximately million in we intend to finance these capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
we expect to supplement our capital budget with additional amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility  in particular to satisfy short term working capital needs  but do not currently expect our total indebtedness to increase significantly by the end of relative to total indebtedness of million at march  as of that date  we had million in unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
uncertainties relating to our capital resources and requirements in include those associated with the planned master limited partnership offering discussed below and the possibility that we will pursue one or more significant acquisitions that would require additional debt or equity financing 
in addition  as discussed in business and properties description of properties texas  we have entered into an agreement pursuant to which denbury resources has an option to acquire our interest in part of the hastings complex for cash or by entering into a volumetric production payment or similar arrangement with us 
if the option is exercised  the consideration we would receive would be a significant additional source of liquidity  subject to potential mandatory repayment requirements under our credit facilities 
however  we would not expect to receive any such consideration until the first quarter of at the earliest 
master limited partnership 
a recently formed subsidiary of ours  venoco acquisition company  lp  which we refer to as the master limited partnership or the mlp  has filed a preliminary registration statement on form s in connection with a proposed offering of common units representing limited partnership interests in the mlp 
we expect to capitalize the mlp through the contribution of our interests in certain onshore fields in california and a portion of our interests in the south ellwood field and in the hastings complex 
we anticipate receiving an initial cash distribution in connection with the offering of mlp interests  but the amount of the distribution  if any  has not been determined 
we currently expect to use any such distribution  net of any required tax payments  to reduce indebtedness under one or both of our credit facilities or to repurchase or redeem some or all of our senior notes 
the nature  amount and timing of such a reduction in indebtedness will depend on a variety of factors  including the amount of the distribution and the amount then outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in some circumstances  we would be required to use some or all of the distribution to reduce the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
our plans with respect to the mlp  the mlp offering and any related distribution to us may change  and we cannot assure you that any mlp offering will be completed 
we expect the mlp offering to be completed only if capital market conditions are favorable 
amended revolving credit facility 
we entered into a second amended and restated agreement governing our revolving credit facility in march  and have entered into several subsequent amendments to the agreement 
the borrowing base under the facility is currently million 
the agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default  indemnities and covenants  including operational covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of ebitda as defined in the agreement to interest expense  current assets to current liabilities  debt to ebitda and pv to total debt 
the agreement will require us to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
the completion of the mlp offering could result in a reduction of the borrowing base under the facility  and thus require us to prepay some of the borrowings then outstanding under the facility 
principal on the revolving credit facility is payable on march  the revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
loans under the revolving credit facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of bank of montreal s announced base rate and the overnight federal funds rate plus plus ii an applicable margin ranging from zero to  based upon utilization 
loans designated as libo rate loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i libor plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
a commitment fee ranging from to per annum is payable with respect to unused borrowing availability under the facility 
second lien term loan 
we entered into a new second lien term loan agreement in may to refinance and replace our prior second lien term loan facility 
we borrowed million pursuant to the new term loan agreement  of which million was used to repay all amounts outstanding under the prior second lien term loan facility plus accrued interest  million was used to pay a prepayment premium on those amounts and million was used to pay transaction costs associated with the new facility 
the remaining borrowings were used to reduce amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the term loan agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default and indemnities and certain customary covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
the covenants and other terms of the agreement contain exceptions that are intended to permit us to form an mlp and certain related entities  to contribute assets to the mlp  to sell securities of the mlp and to cause the mlp to incur indebtedness and issue securities  subject in each case to the satisfaction of certain requirements 
the agreement requires us to maintain derivative contracts covering at least of our projected oil and natural gas production attributable to proved developed producing reserves through may   and at least of such production on an annual basis thereafter 
we cannot  however  enter into derivative contracts other than certain put contracts covering more than of such oil and gas production in any month 
the agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock 
the agreement will require us to make offers to prepay amounts outstanding under the second lien term loan facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
amounts prepaid under the facility may not be reborrowed 
the new term loan facility is secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
loans under the term loan facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of the overnight federal funds rate plus and the administrative agent s announced base rate  plus ii 
loans designated as libo rate loans bear interest at libor plus 
we have entered into interest rate swaps pursuant to which amounts borrowed under the new term loan agreement will effectively bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately until june see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate derivative transactions 
senior notes 
we issued million of our senior notes in december the notes bear interest at per year and will mature on december  we may redeem the notes after december   initially at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount 
in addition  before december   we may redeem all or part of the notes at a specified make whole price 
upon the occurrence of a change of control of our company  each holder of notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes for cash at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the notes also contains operational covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets 
the notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries other than ellwood pipeline  inc and are secured with the second lien term loan on an equal and ratable basis 
because we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our debt  that portion of our cash flow is not available for other purposes 
our ability to make scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and pursue our capital expenditure plan will depend to a significant extent on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices and a variety of other factors 
if our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our capital expenditure budget  we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled capital projects  sell material assets or operations and or seek additional capital 
needed capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness and certain other means is limited by covenants in our debt agreements 
in addition  pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions in our credit facilities  our ability to respond to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets or incurring additional indebtedness would be limited by provisions in the facilities that require us to use some or all of the proceeds of such transactions to reduce amounts outstanding under one or both of the facilities in some circumstances 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed and on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us  meet our debt obligations or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 
commitments and contingencies as of december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years were as follows in thousands less than one year to years to years after years total long term debt     interest on senior notes    rental of office space     total      total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
our total asset retirement obligations were million at december  amounts related to interest expense on our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility are not included in the table above because the interest rates on those debt instruments are variable 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred interest expense on those debt instruments of million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  oil and natural gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on the likelihood of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value and the rate of depletion of the oil and natural gas properties 
for example  oil and natural gas price changes affect the estimated economic lives of oil and natural gas properties and therefore cause reserve revisions 
our december  estimate of net proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled mboe 
had oil and natural gas prices been lower as of the date of the estimate  our total oil and natural gas reserves would have been approximately lower 
in addition  our proved reserves are concentrated in a relatively small number of wells 
at december   of our proved reserves were concentrated in our twenty one largest wells 
as a result  any changes in proved reserves attributable to such individual wells could have a significant effect on our total reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development and capitalized asset retirement costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the capitalized investment 
changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
for example  a reduction in our estimated reserves as of december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately per boe in our depletion expense rate during costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and natural gas properties 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves established or impairment determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis using a comparison of the carrying values of the unproved properties to net future cash flows 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the last day of the relevant quarter  including the effects of cash flow hedges  and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
at december   our net capitalized costs did not exceed the ceiling 
we last incurred a write down due to the ceiling test at the end of  at which time our net capitalized cost exceeded the ceiling by million  net of income tax effects  and we recorded a write down of our oil and natural gas properties in that amount 
asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas provides that  if the fair value for asset retirement obligations can be reasonably estimated  the liability should be recognized in the period when it is incurred 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well 
under the method prescribed by sfas no 
 the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with the offsetting charge to property cost 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded in the income statement 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 we accrued for future abandonment costs of wells and related facilities through our depletion calculation in accordance with regulation s x rule and industry practice 
this method resulted in recognition of the obligation over the life of the property on a unit of production basis  with the estimated obligation netted in property cost as part of the accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization balance 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable laws 
we have determined our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to each liability 
the discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the relevant obligation  but typically ranged between and 
we periodically review the estimate of costs to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives 
this includes a review of both the estimated costs and the expected timing to incur such costs 
we believe most of these costs can be estimated with reasonable certainty based upon existing laws and regulatory requirements and based upon wells and facilities currently in place 
any changes in regulatory requirements  which changes cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  could result in material changes in such costs 
changes in reserve estimates and the economic life of oil and natural gas properties could affect the timing of such costs and accordingly the present value of such costs 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we have not recognized a valuation allowance against our net deferred taxes because we believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of our future operating income 
derivative instruments under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  a risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
changes in commodity prices will result in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity swap agreements  and in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity collars to the extent the changes are outside the floor or cap of our collars

pv value and reserve replacement costs pv value the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv value  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company s unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv value based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using prices and costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  without giving effect to hedging activities  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
the following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to pv value as of the dates shown in thousands december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  add present value of future income tax discounted at  pv value    based on unescalated prices of i per bbl for oil and natural gas liquids  adjusted for quality  transportation fees and regional price differentials and ii per mmbtu for natural gas  adjusted for energy content  transportation fees and regional price differentials 
based on unescalated prices of per bbl for oil and natural gas liquids and per mmbtu for natural gas  adjusted  in each case  as described in note above 
based on unescalated prices of per bbl for oil and natural gas liquids and per mmbtu for natural gas  adjusted  in each case  as described in note above 
reserve replacement costs we discuss our historical reserve replacement costs in business and properties our strengths attractive reserve replacement costs 
we define the term reserve replacement cost to mean an amount per boe equal to the sum of all costs incurred relating to oil and natural gas property acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration activities as reflected in our year end financial statements for the relevant year divided by the sum of all additions and revisions to estimated proved reserves  including reserve purchases 
the calculation of reserve additions for each year is based upon the reserve report of our independent engineers as of the end of the relevant period  and includes  where applicable  production from the date acquisitions were completed through the date of the reserve report 
management uses reserve replacement cost to compare our company to others in terms of our historical ability to increase our reserve base in an economic manner 
however  our historical reserve replacement costs are not necessarily indicative of the reserve replacement costs we will incur in the future 
historical sources of reserve additions  such as acquisitions  may be more expensive or unavailable in the future 
increases in commodity prices in recent years  and corresponding increases in the market value of oil and natural gas properties  have resulted in increases in our reserve replacement costs 
in addition  some companies define reserve replacement cost differently than we do  a fact that limits the usefulness of reserve replacement cost as a comparative measure in some circumstances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we purchase puts and enter into other derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil and natural gas prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
this section also provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage interest rate risk

the objective of our hedging activities and the use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows 
our hedging activities mitigate our exposure to price declines and allow us more flexibility to continue to execute our capital plan even if prices decline 
our collar and swap contracts  however  prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
also  if production is less than the amount we have hedged and the price of oil or natural gas exceeds a fixed price in a hedge contract  we will be required to make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
this could impact our ability to fund future capital expenditures 
in addition  we have incurred  and may incur in the future  substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in connection with our hedging activities  although we do not expect such losses to have a material effect on our ability to fund expected capital expenditures 
finally  the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
because a large portion of our commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and to increase clarity in our financial statements  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting effective april  consequently  from that date forward  we have recognized mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently  rather than deferring such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income for those commodity derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in commodity derivative gains losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
interest rate derivative transactions we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to amounts borrowed under our credit facilities because those amounts bear interest at variable rates 
as of march   there was approximately million outstanding under those facilities 
we have entered into two interest rate swap transactions to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our second lien term loan facility 
in may  we entered into a swap to lock in our interest cost on million of borrowings through may in june  we entered into a second swap to lock in our interest cost on million of borrowings through may and on million of borrowings from may through june as a result of these transactions  amounts borrowed under the second lien term loan facility will effectively bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately until june accordingly  we expect to be subject to interest rate risk until that time only with respect to amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
a increase in interest rates on unhedged variable rate borrowings of million at december  would result in additional annualized interest expense of million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a liability of million
