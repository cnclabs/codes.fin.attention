item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statement and supplementary data in item of this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements below 
overview we are one of the world s largest offshore drilling contractors operating  as of february   a fleet of rigs  consisting of two deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackups  platform rigs  five managed deepwater drilling rigs and seven eastern hemisphere based land drilling rigs 
we have three ultra deepwater drillships under construction 
our customers include major integrated oil and natural gas companies  state owned national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling services to smaller companies focused on more specific geographic or technological areas 
we operate in many of the significant deepwater oil and natural gas basins throughout the world  including brazil  west africa and the gulf of mexico 
in addition to our owned deepwater fleet  we also manage the drilling operations for five deepwater rigs owned by our customers 
with our combined owned and managed fleet  we believe that we are the second largest operator of deepwater rigs and that our deepwater fleet is among the youngest in the industry  with seven of our eight deepwater rigs having been placed into service since we believe our deepwater experience and the age of our fleet gives us a competitive advantage for contract opportunities  including newbuild prospects  over our competitors with older  lower specification rigs or competitors with less operating and engineering experience in deepwater 
we are increasing our emphasis on deepwater and other high specification drilling solutions 
we believe that customer demands to explore and develop deepwater fields will exceed the capacity of the existing deepwater drilling rig fleet for the next several years 
in line with this belief  since we have invested or committed to invest over billion in the expansion of our deepwater fleet 
our accomplishments include our acquisition of the remaining outside joint venture interests in our two existing drillships  acquiring the remaining interests in two of our deepwater semisubmersible rigs in brazil  and expanding our drillship fleet through our three ultra deepwater drillships under construction  two of which have drilling contracts for periods of at least five years after delivery 
as part of our focus on deepwater and premium offshore services  we have sought opportunities to dispose of non core assets to enable us to reinvest our financial and human capital to develop our growth strategy 
most notably  in  we sold our latin america land and e p services business for approximately billion in cash and completed the sale of our three tender assist barges for million in cash in the first quarter of recent developments investments in deepwater fleet in june  we entered into an agreement with samsung heavy industries co  ltd 
to construct an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship 
the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before june  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
we expect the total project cost  including commissioning and testing  to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
in connection with the construction contract  we entered into a license agreement with the holder of certain patents  which are expected to expire in  related to the drillship s dual activity capabilities 
under the license agreement  we paid the holder a fee of million for the initial drillship and we will pay an additional million for any additional drilling units that use the patented technology  plus five percent of the revenue earned by the drillship and any additional units reduced by a million credit per unit for any of the additional units in jurisdictions where the license is applicable 
although we currently do not have a drilling contract for this drillship  we expect that the anticipated demand resulting from the continuing expansion of 
table of contents customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity should provide us with a number of opportunities to contract the rig prior to its delivery date 
in july  we acquired from lexton shipping ltd 
an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship being constructed by samsung 
as consideration for our acquisition of lexton s rights under the drillship construction contract with samsung  we paid lexton million in cash and assumed its obligations under the construction contract  including remaining scheduled payments of approximately million 
the construction contract provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before february  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
in january  we entered into a five year contract with respect to the drillship for drilling operations in the us gulf of mexico  which is expected to commence during the third quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to the us gulf of mexico and customer acceptance testing 
in connection with the contract  the drillship is being modified from the original design to improve its off line operational capabilities 
including these modifications  amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
in august  we acquired the remaining nine percent interest in our angolan joint venture company for million in cash from a subsidiary of sonangol  the national oil company of angola 
the joint venture owned the two deepwater drillships pride africa and pride angola and the foot independent leg jackup rig pride cabinda  and held management agreements for the deepwater platform rigs kizomba a and kizomba b 
in january  we entered into an agreement with samsung to construct an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship 
the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before march  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
we have entered into a multi year drilling contract with respect to the drillship  which is expected to commence during the first quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig and customer acceptance testing 
under the drilling contract  the customer may elect  by january   a firm contract term of at least five years and up to seven years in duration 
we expect the total project cost  including commissioning and testing  to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
dispositions in august  we completed the sale to gp investments ltd  a private equity firm based in brazil  of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries through which we conducted the business of our latin america land and e p services segments 
the purchase price paid at closing of billion in cash is subject to adjustment based on the working capital of the business at the closing date 
we have agreed not to compete with the land drilling and e p services business in mexico  central america and south america or solicit employees of the business for a period of three years following the closing 
we and the buyer have agreed  subject to certain limitations  to indemnify each other against various matters  which could be material 
in august  we also entered into an agreement to sell our fleet of three self erecting  tender assist rigs to ferncliff tih as of norway for million in cash 
we completed the sale the rigs in the first quarter of in connection with the sale  we entered into an agreement to operate one of the rigs until its current contract is completed  which is anticipated to be in december we have reclassified all of our historical operations of the latin america land and e p services segments and our three tender assist rigs to discontinued operations 
unless noted otherwise  our discussion and analysis that follows relates to our continuing operations only 
subsequent to the disposition of our latin america land and e p services segments  our operations consist of one reportable segment  offshore drilling services 
fcpa investigation during the course of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our latin american operations  our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials 
in february  the audit committee of our board of directors assumed direct responsibility over the 
table of contents investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations  as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues  and to advise the audit committee 
the investigation  which is continuing  has found evidence suggesting that payments  which may violate the us foreign corrupt practices act  were made to government officials in venezuela and mexico aggregating less than million 
the evidence to date regarding these payments suggests that payments were made beginning in early through a to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore venezuela  and b to one or more government officials  or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials  for the purpose of collecting payment for work completed in connection with offshore drilling contracts in venezuela 
in addition  the evidence suggests that other payments were made beginning in through early a to one or more government officials in mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs  the movement of personnel through immigration or the acceptance of a jackup rig under a drilling contract  and b with respect to the potentially improper entertainment of government officials in mexico 
the audit committee  through independent outside counsel  has undertaken a review of our compliance with the fcpa in certain of our other international operations 
in addition  the us department of justice has asked us to provide information with respect to a our relationships with a freight and customs agent and b our importation of rigs into nigeria 
the audit committee is reviewing the issues raised by the request  and we are cooperating with the doj in connection with its request 
this review has found evidence suggesting that during the period from through payments were made directly or indirectly to government officials in saudi arabia  kazakhstan  brazil  nigeria  libya  angola  and the republic of the congo in connection with clearing rigs or equipment through customs or resolving outstanding issues with customs  immigration  tax  licensing or merchant marine authorities in those countries 
in addition  this review has found evidence suggesting that in payments were made to one or more third parties with the intent that they would be transferred to a government official in india for the purpose of resolving a customs dispute related to the importation of one of our jackup rigs 
the evidence suggests that the aggregate amount of payments referred to in this paragraph is less than million 
we are also reviewing certain agent payments related to malaysia 
the investigation of the matters described in the prior paragraph and the audit committee s compliance review are ongoing 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that evidence of additional potential fcpa violations may not be uncovered in those or other countries 
our management and the audit committee of our board of directors believe it likely that members of our senior operations management either were aware  or should have been aware  that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made 
our former chief operating officer resigned as chief operating officer effective on may  and has elected to retire from the company  although he will remain an employee  but not an officer  during the pendency of the investigation to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business 
his retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our audit committee or our board of directors that it does not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment 
other personnel  including officers  have been terminated or placed on administrative leave or have resigned in connection with the investigation 
we have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty  integrity  ethical standards and compliance with the law 
we voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation and compliance review to the doj and the securities and exchange commission and are cooperating with these authorities as the investigation and compliance reviews continue and as they review the matter 
if violations of the fcpa occurred  we could be subject to fines  civil and criminal penalties  equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement  and injunctive relief 
civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time 
table of contents may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  sanctions or other penalties  which could be material individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec  the applicable government or other authorities or our customers or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions 
our business we provide contract drilling services to major integrated  government owned and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world 
our offshore drilling fleet competes on a global basis  as offshore rigs generally are highly mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
while the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
rig availability  location and technical ability and each contractor s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination 
all of our drilling contracts with major customers are on a dayrate basis  where we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
we provide the rigs and drilling crews and are responsible for the payment of rig operating and maintenance expenses 
our customer bears the economic risk and benefit relative to the geologic success of the wells 
the markets for our drilling services are highly cyclical 
our operating results are significantly affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling services 
these drilling programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies expectations about oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  demand for crude oil and natural gas products and many other factors 
the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  availability of qualified rigs and operating personnel  relative production costs  availability and lead time requirements for drilling and production equipment  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling services 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
for example  contracts in the us gulf of mexico tend to be shorter term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to quickly impact revenues and cash flows from those operations 
contracts in international offshore markets tend to be longer term  so a change in market conditions tends to have a delayed impact 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions may have minimal short term impact on revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the timing of contract renewals takes place during the short term changes in the market 
generally  we expect global demand for offshore contract drilling services to remain strong  driven by increasing worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on offshore prospects and increased global participation by national oil companies 
customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity continue to expand  as successful results in exploration drilling have led to prolonged field development programs around the world  placing deepwater assets in limited supply beyond the end of the decade 
we believe that long term market conditions for deepwater drilling services are favorable and that demand for deepwater rigs will continue to exceed supply for the next several years  producing attractive opportunities for deepwater drilling rigs  including ultra deepwater rigs like ours under construction 
we believe that higher prices for oil  geological successes in exploratory markets and  in general  more favorable political conditions will continue to encourage the development of new projects by exploration and production companies on a number of major 
table of contents deepwater discoveries 
in addition  we believe that the need for deepwater rigs will continue to grow for existing offshore development projects 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply of drilling rigs and demand for drilling services for the different rig classes we operate  as well as our rigs operational performance  including mechanical efficiency 
the number of rigs we have available may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs and the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another for which we may receive a mobilization fee 
mobilization fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract 
our earnings from operations are primarily affected by revenues  cost of labor  repairs and maintenance and utilization of our drilling fleet 
many of our drilling contracts allow us to increase the dayrates charged to our customer based on increases in operating costs  such as increases in labor costs  maintenance and repair costs  and insurance costs 
some of our costs are fixed in nature or do not vary at the same time or to the same degree as changes in revenue 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle between contracts and earn no revenue  we will still maintain our rig crew  which reduces our earnings as we cannot fully offset the impact of the lost revenues with reductions in operating costs 
our industry is being affected by shortages of  and increased competition for  skilled rig crew personnel due to the level of activity in the drilling industry 
as a result  the costs to attract and retain personnel continue to increase 
to better retain and attract skilled rig personnel  we offer competitive compensation programs and have increased our focus on training and management development programs 
we believe that labor costs will continue to increase in in addition  increased demand for contract drilling operations has increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts  which  when coupled with the consolidation of equipment suppliers  has resulted in longer order lead times to obtain critical spares and other critical equipment components essential to our business  higher repair and maintenance costs and longer out of service time for major repair and upgrade projects 
we anticipate maintaining higher levels of critical spares to minimize unplanned downtime 
with the current level of business activity  we do not expect these trends to moderate in the near term 
however  due to higher market dayrates and our ability to increase dayrates for higher costs  we expect our growth in revenues to continue to outpace our cost increases throughout our operations and activities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the us oil pollution act of  the us outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  other countries where we operate have similar laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
as a result of the significant insurance losses incurred by the drilling industry during the and hurricane seasons  our insurance costs increased significantly when our policies renewed in july our insurance policy has a million aggregate deductible 
in addition  the marine package policy has a sub limit of million for physical damage claims due to a named windstorm in the us gulf of mexico 
we operate in one reportable segment  offshore drilling services  with a global fleet of offshore rigs 
we consider our drillships and our semisubmersible rigs operating in water depths greater than  feet as deepwater and our semisubmersible rigs operating in water depths from  feet to  feet as midwater 
our jackups operate in water depths up to feet 
our deepwater fleet currently operates in west africa  brazil and the mediterranean sea  and is fully contracted through mid  with most of the fleet contracted into and beyond 
as a result  we would benefit from potential dayrate increases for deepwater rigs only when our deepwater fleet can operate under new contracts or as our uncontracted ultra deepwater drillship becomes available 
based on our recent contracts for two of our ultra deepwater rigs under construction and inquiries received from our clients  we believe our customer needs for deepwater drilling rigs are extending five to ten years into the future 
contracts for deepwater rigs tend to be longer term  with some contracts being five or more years in length  reflecting the demand for drilling rigs and our customers long term commitment to deepwater exploration and development 
based on limited rig availability and 
table of contents the geologic success in deepwater  we expect dayrates for deepwater rigs to remain strong for the next several years 
our midwater fleet currently operates in west africa  brazil and the mediterranean sea 
we currently have half of our midwater fleet contracted through at present  strong demand and limited availability of rigs continues to sustain the high dayrates for the midwater fleet 
contracts for midwater rigs tend to be shorter in duration than contracts for deepwater rigs  with one to three years as the typical length 
we believe strong demand and a limited ability to increase semisubmersible rig supply in the short term will result in favorable market conditions through our jackup fleet operates in the us gulf of mexico and internationally in mexico  the middle east  asia pacific and west africa 
contracts for our us gulf of mexico jackup fleet tend to be for shorter periods as compared to international jackup contracts 
also  contracts for our mexico jackup fleet are impacted by dayrate levels in the us gulf of mexico 
we continue to benefit from the current contract dayrates and high utilization in the international jackup market  however  we are beginning to observe indications of the potential negative effect on our dayrates due to worldwide newbuild rig fleet additions over the next three years 
currently  approximately newbuild jackups are expected to be added to the global market with scheduled delivery by the end of and approximately additional newbuild jackups have scheduled delivery dates from through we believe the addition of this rig capacity to the market is likely to result in increased volatility of and downward trends in international jackup dayrates and utilization 
since mid  the dayrate environment in the us gulf of mexico has been under pressure from lower demand for rigs 
we expect our competitors to continue to seek opportunities to relocate rigs from the us gulf of mexico to international markets  including the relocation of additional independent leg jackup rigs to mexico 
while dayrates in the us gulf of mexico have stabilized due to recent increases in fleet utilization  any improvement in dayrates in the us gulf of mexico will largely depend upon changes affecting natural gas storage levels and prices that drive increased activity levels  access to capital for small to medium sized exploration and production companies  seasonality in the market driven by recurring hurricane seasons  and the number and timing of rigs moving from the us gulf of mexico to mexico and other international markets 
as dayrates in mexico are based on us gulf of mexico rates  we expect that dayrates for our mexican fleet will adjust lower in in addition  we will likely be unable to compete for some of the growth opportunities in the mexican jackup market due to the technical limits of some of our rigs 
we incurred approximately  unavailable days for shipyard maintenance and upgrade projects in for our existing fleet 
for  we expect the number of shipyard days to be approximately these shipyard projects may be subject to repair delays 
for our ultra deepwater drillships under construction  we have attempted to mitigate risks of delay by selecting the same shipyard for all three construction projects with fixed fee contracts  although some of our other risks with respect to these construction projects  such as work stoppages  disputes with the shipyard  shipyard financial and other difficulties and adverse weather conditions  are more concentrated 
backlog our backlog at december   totaled approximately billion for our executed contracts 
approximately billion of this backlog is expected to be realized in our backlog at december   was approximately billion 
we calculate our backlog  or future contracted revenue for our offshore fleet  as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract  assuming full utilization 
backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation  customer reimbursables and performance bonuses 
the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amount disclosed or expected due to various factors 
downtime due to various operating factors  including unscheduled repairs  maintenance  weather and other factors  may result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate  as well as the ability of our customers to terminate contracts under certain circumstances 
subsequent to december   we were awarded firm drilling contracts for two of our ultra deepwater drillships under construction 
in addition  we received new contracts or contract extensions for several rigs in our fleet  including the pride north sea  the pride rio de janeiro and the pride portland 
in total  these contracts added approximately billion to our backlog and resulted in our total backlog increasing to approximately billion as of february  
table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and  accordingly  these estimates may change as additional information is obtained  as more experience is acquired  as our operating environment changes and as new events occur 
our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult  subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements  which could be material  if we used different assumptions or estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment  income taxes and contingent liabilities discussed below  however  as previously disclosed  we made a material change in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for certain interest rate swap and cap agreements 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation 
property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value  remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives  especially those involving our rigs  would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
during the three months ended september   we completed a technical evaluation of our offshore fleet 
as a result of this evaluation  remaining useful lives and estimated salvage values were adjusted on certain rigs in the fleet 
these changes were primarily a result of changing market conditions  the significant capital investment in certain rigs and revisions to  and standardization of  maintenance practices 
as a result of our evaluation  effective july   we increased our estimates of the remaining lives of certain semisubmersible and jackup rigs in our fleet between four and eight years  increased the expected useful lives of our drillships from years to years and our semisubmersibles from years to years  and updated our estimated salvage value for all of our offshore drilling rig fleet to of the historical cost of the rigs 
the effect of these changes in estimates was a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million and an after tax increase to diluted earnings per share of for the six month period ended december  we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or assets in a specific geographical region 
however  the drilling and workover industry in which 
table of contents we operate is highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  most of our assets are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the assets being evaluated to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount is not recoverable 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed  or from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income  including where the rigs are expected to be deployed  as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position 
a change in such estimates and assumptions  along with any changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets  liabilities  or valuation allowances as discussed below 
as of december   we have us net operating loss nol carryforwards 
due to our acquisition of marine drilling companies in september  certain nol carryforwards are subject to limitations under sections and of the us internal revenue code 
the us nol carryforwards could expire starting in through we have foreign nol carryforwards  and we have recognized a valuation allowance on substantially all of these foreign nol carryforwards 
certain foreign nol carryforwards do not expire and some could expire starting in through we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these unremitted earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
as required by law  we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments  however  we believe the ultimate 
table of contents resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we received tax assessments from the mexican government related to our operations for the tax years and these assessments contest our right to claim certain deductions in our tax returns for those years 
we anticipate that the mexican government will make additional assessments contesting similar deductions for other tax years 
while we intend to contest these assessments vigorously  we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome  which may take several years 
however  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these assessments will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as required by local statutory requirements  we have provided standby letters of credit  which totaled million as of december   to contest these assessments 
we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous underlying factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among other things  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate  however  past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims  indemnities and potential income and other tax assessments see also income taxes above 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
accounting for interest rate swap and cap agreements we currently use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we have not designated our interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  we must determine the fair value of these agreements and record any changes to the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value is complex and requires significant judgments and estimates  including the methodology of building a forward yield curve  the basis of discounting projected future cash flows and varying conventions in contract terms 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different fair values and could materially affect our results of operations 
segment review subsequent to the disposition of our latin america land and e p services segments in august  our operations consist of one reportable segment  offshore drilling services 
all periods presented have been revised to reflect our latin america land and e p services segments and our three tender assist rigs as discontinued operations 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
as a result of our disposal of the latin america land and e p services segments  certain operating and administrative costs were reallocated for all periods presented to our remaining continuing operating segments

average daily revenues will differ from average contract dayrate due to billing adjustments for any non productive time  mobilization fees  demobilization fees  performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services 
utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period 
deepwater revenues increased million  or  for over as we continue to benefit from the strong demand for our deepwater rigs  which has resulted in higher dayrates and continued high utilization levels across much of the fleet 
this strong performance was led by the pride south pacific  which contributed approximately million of incremental revenue as a result of the commencement of a new contract in march with a dayrate approximately three times higher than its previous contract 
the improvement was also due to increased utilization

liquidity and capital resources our objective in financing our business is to maintain adequate financial resources and access to additional liquidity 
our million senior secured revolving credit facility provides back up liquidity in the event of an unanticipated significant demand on cash that would not be funded by operations 
at december   we had million of availability under this facility 
during  we used cash flows generated from operations as our primary source of liquidity  including for working capital needs  repayment of debt and capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for to fund our working capital needs  scheduled debt repayments and anticipated capital expenditures

subject to the limitations imposed by our existing debt arrangements  we may in the future elect to return capital to our stockholders by share repurchases or the payment of dividends 
in august  we completed the sale of our latin america land and e p services segments and received approximately million of net proceeds 
the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes due require that we use the net proceeds to acquire assets that are used or useful in our business or to repay senior debt 
if the net proceeds not used for these purposes within one year following the closing  referred to as excess proceeds  are greater than million  we are required to make a pro rata offer to purchase the maximum amount of senior notes at par value that can be purchased with the excess proceeds 
upon completion of the offer  we may use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business  which may include the construction or acquisition of rigs or acquisitions of other business in addition to those described in this annual report 
any determination to construct additional rigs for our fleet will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  including the availability of long term contracts with sufficient dayrates for the rigs and the relative costs of building new rigs with advanced capabilities compared with the costs of retrofitting or converting existing rigs to provide similar capabilities 
the timing  size or success of any additional acquisition or construction effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances

amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a margin or the base rate plus a margin 
the interest rate margin varies based on our leverage ratio

many of these restrictions will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by either s p or moody s and  in either case  the notes have a specified minimum rating by the other rating agency 
we are required to offer to repurchase the notes in connection with specified change in control events that result in a ratings decline 
our convertible senior notes due provide for semiannual interest payments and for the payment of contingent interest during any six month interest period commencing on or after may  for which the trading price of the notes for each of the five trading days immediately preceding such period equals or exceeds of the 
table of contents principal amount of the notes 
during any interest period when contingent interest is payable  the contingent interest payable per note will equal of the average trading price of the notes during the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period

the notes are currently convertible 
upon conversion  we will have the right to deliver  in lieu of shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
if we choose to deliver cash upon conversion  we may incur a loss for extinguishment of debt 
the closing price of our common stock on december  was per share 
at this price  if note holders were to convert the entire issue and we chose to deliver cash in lieu of shares  we would pay approximately million to settle the conversion and incur an approximately million debt extinguishment loss 
for each change in our stock price  the incurred debt extinguishment loss for a cash settled conversion would change by approximately million

the notes are collateralized by the two rigs and the net proceeds received by subsidiary project companies chartering the rigs 
although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods  it may limit our flexibility in certain areas 
please read risk factors our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item a of this annual report 
other sources and uses of cash we expect our purchases of property and equipment for  excluding our new drillship commitments  to be approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be used primarily for various rig upgrades in connection with new contracts as contracts expire during the year along with other sustaining capital projects 
with respect to our three ultra deepwater drillships currently under construction  the total estimated remaining costs are approximately billion 
we anticipate making additional payments for the construction of these drillships of approximately million in  approximately million in  approximately million in  and approximately million in we expect to fund construction of these rigs through available cash  cash flow from operations and borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another  as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customer s specifications  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred  whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized 
the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing 
generally  contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets 

table of contents additionally  we defer costs associated with obtaining in class certification from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our offshore rigs 
we amortize these costs over the period of validity of the related certificate 
we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business segments  which may include the construction of rigs for our fleet and acquisitions of rigs and other business 
while we have no definitive agreements to acquire or construct additional equipment or to acquire any businesses  suitable opportunities may arise in the future 
any determination to construct additional rigs for our fleet will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  including the availability of long term contracts with sufficient dayrates for the rigs and the relative costs of building new rigs with advanced capabilities compared with the costs of retrofitting or converting existing rigs to provide similar capabilities 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition or construction effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
we consider from time to time opportunities to dispose of certain assets or groups of assets when we believe the capital could be more effectively deployed 
in addition to the matters described in this liquidity and capital resources section  please read business outlook and segment review for additional matters that may have a material impact on our liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was  million and  million  respectively  which was more than its carrying value as of december  and of million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
as of december   we held interest rate swap and cap agreements relating to the drillship loan facility as required by the lenders 
we have not designated these interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging instruments 
table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the interest rate swap and cap agreements are marked to market with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap and cap agreements was an asset of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we did not enter into any forward exchange or option contracts in and  however  we may elect to enter into contracts in the future as we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
