risk factors risk factors that may affect our business are as follows our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate for certain of our product lines  we establish and carry as a liability actuarially determined reserves that are calculated to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims 
these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of our future benefit liabilities  but are instead estimates based on assumptions  which can be materially affected by changes in the national or regional economy  changes in social perceptions about work ethics  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging or changing health issues and changes in industry regulation 
claims experience on our products can fluctuate widely from period to period 
if actual events vary materially from our assumptions used when establishing the reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims  we may be required to increase our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect our financial results our long term disability products provide coverage for claims incurred during the policy period 
generally  group policies offer rate guarantees for periods from one to three years 
while we can prospectively re price and re underwrite coverages at the end of these guarantee periods  we must pay benefits with respect to claims incurred during these periods annual report part i without being able to increase guaranteed premium rates during these periods 
historically  approximately of all claims filed under our long term disability policies close within months 
however  claims caused by more severe disabling conditions may be paid over much longer periods  including  in some cases  up to normal retirement age or longer 
longer duration claims  in addition to a higher volume of claims than we expect  expose us to the possibility that we may pay benefits in excess of the amount that we anticipated when the policy was underwritten 
the profitability of our long term disability products is thus subject to volatility resulting from the difference between our actual claims experience and our assumptions at the time of underwriting and from changes in economic conditions 
we are exposed to concentration risk on our group life insurance business due to the nature of group life insurance coverage  we are subject to geographical concentration risk from the occurrence of a catastrophe 
catastrophic losses from a disease pandemic could have an adverse effect on us our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of loss from an occurrence of catastrophic mortality caused by a disease pandemic  such as could arise from the avian flu  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
catastrophic losses from terrorism or other factors could have an adverse effect on us an occurrence of a significant catastrophic event  including natural disasters  terrorism  or other disasters  or a change in the nature and availability of reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be exposed to disintermediation risk during periods of increasing interest rates in periods of increasing interest rates  withdrawals of annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to invest in investments with higher perceived returns 
this process  referred to as disintermediation  may lead to cash outflows 
these outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans  which are relatively illiquid  thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation during a period of rising interest rates 
our profitability may be adversely affected by declining interest rates during periods of declining interest rates  annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments  resulting in increases in the percentage of policies remaining in force from year to year during a period when our new investments carry lower returns 
during these periods  lower returns on our investments could prove inadequate for us to meet contractually guaranteed minimum payments to holders of our annuity products 
in addition  the profitability of our life and disability insurance products can be affected by declining interest rates 
a factor in pricing our insurance products is prevailing interest rates 
longer duration claims and premium rate guarantee periods can expose us to interest rate risk when portfolio yields are less than those assumed when pricing these products 
mortgages and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates  and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
our investment portfolio is subject to risks of market value fluctuations  defaults  delinquencies and liquidity our general account investments primarily consist of fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate 
the market values of our investments vary with changing economic and market conditions and interest rates 
in addition  we are subject to default risk on our fixed maturity securities portfolio  and delinquency and default risk on our commercial mortgage loans 
our commercial mortgage loans are relatively illiquid 
we may have difficulty selling commercial mortgage loans at attractive prices  in a timely manner  or both if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice 
our business is subject to significant competition each of our business segments faces competition from other insurers and financial services companies  such as banks  broker dealers  mutual funds  and managed care providers for employer groups  individual consumers and distributors 
since many of our competitors have greater financial resources  offer a broader array of products and  with respect to other insurers  may have higher financial strength ratings than we do  the possibility exists that any one of our business segments could be adversely affected  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a significant downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business financial strength ratings  which rate our claims paying ability  are an stancorp financial group  inc 
important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and in our ability to market our products 
rating organizations continually review the financial performance and condition of insurance companies  including our company 
a significant ratings downgrade could increase our surrender levels and could adversely affect our ability to market our products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our profitability may be affected by changes in state and federal regulation our business is subject to comprehensive state regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
while we cannot predict the impact of potential or future state or federal legislation or regulation on our business  future laws and regulations  or the interpretation thereof  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our business is subject to litigation risk in the normal course of business  we are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance business and investment operations 
we are from time to time involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings 
while the outcome of any pending or future litigation cannot be predicted  as of the date hereof  we do not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  no assurances can be given that such litigation would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the concentration of our investments in california may subject us to losses resulting from an economic downturn as well as certain catastrophes in this state our commercial mortgage loans are concentrated in the western region of the us  particularly in california 
due to this concentration  we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in california as well as to certain catastrophes  such as earthquakes and fires  which may affect the region 
although we diversify our commercial mortgage loan portfolio within california by both location and type of property in an effort to reduce earthquake exposure  such diversification may not eliminate the risk of such losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be exposed to environmental liability from our commercial mortgage loan and real estate investments as a commercial mortgage lender  we customarily conduct environmental assessments prior to making commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and before taking title through foreclosure to real estate collateralizing delinquent commercial mortgage loans held by us 
based on our environmental assessments  we believe that any compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of affected properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that material compliance costs will not be incurred by us 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in sufficient amounts to pay dividends to shareholders  make payments on debt securities and meet our other obligations we are a holding company for our insurance and asset management subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends and permitted payments from our subsidiaries are our principal source of cash to meet our other obligations  pay dividends to shareholders and make payments on debt securities 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and interest payments on debt securities primarily will depend upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries 
many of our subsidiaries are non insurance businesses and have no regulatory restrictions on dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries  however  are regulated by insurance laws and regulations that limit the maximum amount of dividends  distributions and other payments that they could declare and pay to us without prior approval of the states in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
under oregon law  standard insurance company may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business 
oregon law gives the director of the oregon department of consumer and business services insurances division oregon insurance division broad discretion regarding the approval of dividends 
oregon law requires us to receive the prior approval of the oregon insurance division to pay a dividend if such dividend exceeds certain statutory limitations  however  it is at the oregon insurance division s discretion to request prior approval of dividends at any time

annual report part i our business may be affected by employment and wage growth two factors in the growth of stancorp s group businesses are the employment levels  and salary and wage growth of its employer groups 
a reduction in either of these factors may affect premium levels for our group businesses 
our profitability may be adversely affected by declining equity markets sustained equity market declines could result in decreases in the value of our retirement plans assets under administration  which could reduce our ability to earn administrative fee income derived from the value of those assets
