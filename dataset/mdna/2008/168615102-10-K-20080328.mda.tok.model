this concept offers intimate apparel  sleepwear  and activewear that was initially aimed at the chico s target customer 
in early fiscal  the soma brand was repositioned under the name soma intimates to appeal to a broader customer base 
in early fiscal  the company acquired the fitigues brand  which had began its operations in and which was a fitness inspired brand of activewear clothing 
during fiscal  the company completed an internal evaluation of the fitigues brand and  in the fourth quarter  decided to close down operations of the fitigues brand 
in march  the company announced the planned closure of the fitigues brand operations 
accordingly  for all periods presented  the operating results for fitigues are shown as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of income 
also  in early fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of all outstanding franchise rights which included minnesota stores and florida store 
the company earns revenues and generates cash through the sale of merchandise in its retail stores and through its call centers  which handle sales related to the chico s  wh bm  and soma catalog and online operations 
since the company opened its first chico s store in  its retail store system has grown to  stores as of march   including chico s stores  wh bm stores  and soma stores 
during fiscal  the company opened net new stores exclusive of the fitigues closures and repurchased the remaining franchised chico s stores

the company has revised its targeted new store openings for fiscal downward to approximately net new stores  of which are expected to be chico s stores  are expected to be wh bm stores and none are expected to be soma stores 
the company also currently anticipates relocations expansions in fiscal planned square footage growth for fiscal is now estimated to be approximately a increase in selling square footage  slightly lower than the originally announced goal of a increase 
the primary factors which historically have influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in number of stores and selling square footage  its positive comparable store sales  and its strong operating margin 
in the last five years the company has grown from stores as of february  to  stores as of february   which includes the significant store growth resulting from the acquisition of the wh bm stores in fiscal and the launch of the soma brand in fiscal the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores  the expansion of existing stores  the development of new opportunities such as soma and through the extension of its merchandise lines 
the company anticipates that its rate of growth measured by overall growth in sales  growth in comparable store sales  and other factors will decrease from the rate of overall 
table of contents sales growth experienced in recent years which had been in the range of  reflecting in large part the company s significantly increased size  its more manageable net square footage growth goal for fiscal  its net square footage growth goal for fiscal and the expectation that its same store sales will continue to be negative for the first half of fiscal  return to positive in the second half of fiscal  may continue to experience flat to only moderate increases going forward  and may again experience decreases from time to time  as is currently the case 
the company generally expects to continue to generate the necessary cash flow to fund its expansion and to take advantage of new opportunities 
the company has no long term debt and foresees no current need to incur long term debt to support its continued growth 
factors that will be critical to determining the company s future success include  among others  managing the overall growth strategy  including the ability to open and operate stores effectively  maximizing efficiencies in the merchandising  product development and sourcing processes  maintaining high standards for customer service and assistance  maintaining newness  fit and comfort in its merchandise offerings  matching merchandise offerings to customer preferences and needs  customer acceptance of new store concepts  integrating new or acquired businesses  maturing the newer brand concepts  implementing the process of senior management succession  and generating cash to fund the company s expansion needs

the company believes its same store sales were affected by numerous challenges including a difficult macro economic environment  declining consumer confidence resulting in particularly cautious spending  one of the warmest fall selling seasons on record  lower than anticipated customer traffic and merchandise offerings that were not as compelling from a fashion sense as the company has offered in the past 
the company s current strategy is to target a general overall trend to return to comparable store sales growth 
the company believes that its ability to realize such a general overall positive trend in comparable store sales will prove to be a key factor in determining its future levels of success particularly in terms of the company s success i in effectively operating its stores across all brands  ii in managing its continuing store expansion program across all brands  iii in maturing and developing its newer brands and iv in achieving its targeted levels of earnings per share 
positive operating cash flow in fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations compared with million in fiscal  which represents a decrease of approximately 
although operating cash flow decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  the company generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund the ongoing needs of operations and investments

loyalty clubs and customer development management believes that a significant indicator of the company s success is the extent of the ongoing spending and future growth of its loyalty programs  the passport club and the black book  and support for such loyalty programs that is provided through its personalized customer service training programs and its marketing initiatives 
the passport club  the chico s and soma frequent shopper club  features discounts and other special promotions for its members

quality and merit of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain the acceptance of its merchandise offerings  the company monitors sell through levels  inventory turns  gross margins and markdown rates on a classification and style level 
although the company does not disclose these statistics for competitive reasons  this analysis helps identify comfort  fit and newness issues at an early date and helps the company plan future product development and buying 
in addition to the key performance indicators mentioned above  the company s operational strategies are focused on qualitative factors as well 
the company s ability to manage its multiple brands  to develop and grow its newer soma concept  to expand the company s direct to consumer business  to secure new store locations including relocations and or expansions of existing stores and to launch new product categories within all brands  are all important strategies that  if successful  should contribute to the continued growth of the company 
the company continues to evaluate and monitor the progress of its soma intimate apparel initiative 
the company recognizes that the soma business can be seen as complementary to its basic apparel business  but also understands that many aspects of this business require unique attention 
the company monitors soma merchandise offerings in a manner similar to its other brands with special emphasis on repeat purchases in the foundation category 
the company anticipates that additional investment will be required to establish the soma brand as a suitable business that meets the profitability goals of the company over the longer term 
the company estimates that the soma brand reduced the company s earnings per share by for fiscal and  to a lesser extent  will continue to be dilutive in fiscal the company further believes that an impact on earnings per share of this order is acceptable when balanced against the potential of the brand s perceived longer term potential 
in addition  the company believes that eventual profitability is in part dependent on the ability to open a critical mass of soma stores currently believed to be at least stores and the planned slowdown in the new store openings in order to focus on improving the existing soma operations and profitability pushes that target further into the future 
in fiscal year  the company reported net sales  operating income and net income of billion  million and million  respectively 
net sales increased by  while operating income and net income decreased by and  respectively  from the prior fiscal year

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales over the prior period by approximately basis points primarily due to increased store operating expenses mostly due to increases in occupancy and personnel costs as a percentage of sales and from the deleverage associated with the 
table of contents negative comparable store sales 
to a lesser extent  sg a expenses increased over the prior period due to increased marketing expenses as well as from increased shared services costs  mainly personnel relocation  recruitment and severance costs  technology and marketing support costs offset slightly by decreased stock based and incentive compensation 
sales and profitability trends are further discussed in the results of operations section 
future outlook although the company is seeing improving comparable store sales trends in the wh bm brand  and continuing strong top line performance for the soma brand  the chico s brand is on a slower path to improving comparable store sales 
the company is actively addressing issues in its accessories and travelers collection for the chico s brand  and recently added a senior level merchant to each of these areas 
the company expects to see improvement in these categories later in fiscal the company is currently forecasting negative consolidated comparable store sales for the first half of fiscal  and expects to have lower earnings than the first half of fiscal the company s current expectations are to return to positive consolidated comparable store sales increases in the second half of fiscal resulting in overall earnings growth during this time frame 
the company has also significantly lowered its capital expenditure plans for fiscal the total capital expenditure plan for fiscal ranges from approximately million compared to approximately million of capital expenditures in fiscal the company s current plan contemplates opening approximately net new stores  of which are expected to be chico s stores  are expected to be wh bm stores and none are expected to be soma stores

on february   the company completed the first major phase of its multi year  planned implementation of the new erp system by converting its soma brand to the new merchandising system as well as rolling out the new financial systems at the same time 
the second major phase anticipates an initial roll out and utilization of this new system in each of its other brands beginning in early fiscal with completion anticipated in mid to late fiscal the third major phase contemplates on going enhancements and optimization of the new erp across all three brands  as well as the deployment of additional functionality across various other functions within the company through fiscal and beyond 
the company expects that the costs associated with the implementation of the erp system will be funded from the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances 
given the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in its bank credit facilities  the company does not believe that it would need to seek other sources of financing to conduct its operations or pursue its expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if the company were to increase the number of new stores planned to be opened in future periods 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at february  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of february   the company s contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consists of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  as well as amounts due on commercial letters of credit outstanding 
in june  the company entered into the second restated revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america  na the agreement  which replaced the restated revolving credit and term loan agreement dated as of september  on terms and conditions substantially similar to the replaced facility 
the terms of the agreement provide for a million aggregate revolving credit loan commitment  with a letter of credit sublimit of million and a line of credit sublimit of million 
the revolving credit facility is set up to continue to automatically renew for additional one year periods through 
table of contents at february  and february   the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  of the type which certain other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer product returns  inventories  income taxes  insurance reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation and shrinkage the company identifies potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with the company s overall growth rate 
excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory ageings  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in the fashion industry 
the company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
the company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventories between physical inventory counts by applying historical chain wide average shrinkage experience rates to the related periods sales volume 
the historical rates are updated on a regular basis to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
revenue recognition although the company s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company 
retail sales by company stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons 
retail sales by catalog and internet are recorded when shipments are made to catalog and internet customers and are net of estimated customer returns 
net sales to franchisees were recorded when merchandise was shipped to franchisees and were net of estimated returns 
under the company s current program  gift certificate and gift card sales do not have expiration dates 
the company accounts for gift certificates and gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift certificate or gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift certificates and gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate or gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificates or gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
the company recognizes gift card breakage under the redemptive recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on the company s historical gift card breakage rate 
the company determines the gift card breakage rate based on its historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined  it is recognized over a month period based on historical redemption patterns of gift certificates and gift cards 

table of contents the company s policy is to honor customer returns in most instances 
returns after days of the original purchase  or returns without the original receipt  qualify for store credit only 
the company will  in certain circumstances  offer full customer refunds either after days or without a receipt 
the company estimates its reserve for likely customer returns based on the average refund experience in relation to sales for the related period 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  medical and general liability claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using historical experience 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately accrue for estimated losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
operating leases the company accounts for store rent expense in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
accordingly  rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period and which is generally days prior to the store opening date when the company generally begins improvements in preparation of intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic penalty associated with non renewal 
income taxes effective february   the company adopted the provisions of fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement element for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
due to the substantial amounts involved and judgment necessary  the company deems this policy could be critical to its financial statements 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations adjust over time 
the company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the impact of the company s adoption of fin 
table of contents accounting for contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to various proceedings  lawsuits  disputes and claims actions arising from its normal business activities 
many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 
accounting for contingencies arising from these actions requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual  if any  related to such contingencies 
management may also consult with outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of such actions could be different than management s estimate  and adjustments may be required 
stock based compensation expense effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal and fiscal for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for the year ended january  have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current and prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of the company s financial instruments as of february  has not significantly changed since february  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and its marketable securities 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to its revolving line of credit with its bank  however  as of february   the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and  given its current liquidity position  does not expect to utilize its line of credit in the foreseeable future except for its continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
the company s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company s investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
the company s investment portfolio currently consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities  including variable rate demand notes  which are highly liquid  variable rate municipal debt securities and municipal bonds 
although the variable rate municipal debt securities have long term nominal maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates are reset either daily or every days 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities of the variable rate demand notes  the company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities based on the company s cash needs thereby creating a short term instrument 
the municipal bonds have average maturity dates typically less than days 
accordingly  the company s investments are classified as available for sale securities 
as of february   an increase or decrease of basis points in interest rates would have had no impact on the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio
