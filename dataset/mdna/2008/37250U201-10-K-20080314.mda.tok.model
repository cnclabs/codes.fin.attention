item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview geomet  inc is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the exploration for and development and production of natural gas from coal seams coalbed methane or cbm and non conventional shallow gas 
our principal operations and producing properties are located in the cahaba basin in alabama and the central appalachian basin in west virginia and virginia 
we also control additional coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights  principally in alabama  british columbia  virginia  and west virginia 
at december   we controlled a total of approximately  net acres of coalbed methane and oil and natural gas development rights  primarily in alabama  west virginia  virginia  louisiana  colorado  and british columbia 
our major holdings consist of approximately  net acres in the garden city prospect and approximately  net acres in the gurnee field in the cahaba basin in alabama  approximately  net acres in the pond creek field and approximately  net acres in the lasher field in the central appalachian basin  approximately  net acres in the peace river field in british columbia 
the company s proved reserves as of december   as estimated by degolyer and macnaughton  an independent reservoir engineering firm  were approximately bcf  an increase of approximately from year end proved reserves of bcf 
the proved reserves were coalbed methane and were developed 
the pv of proved year end reserves was million using sec pricing of per mmbtu at december  as compared to a pv of million at year end using sec pricing of per mmbtu 
approximately of year end proved reserves are in the gurnee field in alabama and in the pond creek and lasher fields in west virginia and virginia 
average daily net gas sales volumes for were mmcf  an increase of over in  we sold  shares of common stock in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act and  shares of common stock in our initial public offering 
we used the net proceeds of approximately million and the receipt of approximately million from the repayment of certain stockholder loans and from the exercise of stock options to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  of million combined together with million borrowed from our revolving credit facility and million from other sources were sufficient to fund our cash basis capital expenditures of million 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  a decrease of million from the working capital deficit of million at december  the decrease in the working capital was primarily a result of capital expenditures 
at december   we had adequate cash flows from operating activities and credit availability to fund our working capital deficits 
the development of cbm fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  and the timing and volume of initial and subsequent natural gas production 

we estimate total capital expenditures in will be approximately million as compared to million expended in the current year budget includes approximately million for development  million for exploration and evaluation  million for leasehold and million for other capitalized costs 
approximately million 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the capital budget is allocated to the pond creek and lasher fields in virginia and west virginia  million is allocated to the gurnee field and the garden city chattanooga shale prospect in alabama  and million is allocated to the peace river field in british columbia 
in addition  the budget includes a million payment related to the acquisition of a interest in the pond creek field in west virginia 
the payment is based on actual gas prices received for the four year period ended december  as compared to a stated price in the purchase and sales agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
gurnee at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves  or bcf  were located in the gurnee field  of which approximately were classified as proved developed and we had developed approximately of our gurnee field cbm acreage 
we are the operator and own a working interest in the area 
as of december   we had productive wells in the gurnee field 
net daily sales of gas averaged approximately  mcf for at december   our undeveloped cbm acreage in the gurnee field contained proved undeveloped locations and additional drilling locations  based predominantly on acre spacing 
in  we intend to spend approximately million of our capital expenditure budget to drill five wells and expand our facilities in the cahaba basin 
we have the development rights to approximately  net cbm acres in the cahaba basin 
the acreage is roughly evenly divided between a northern block  largely on the east side of the cahaba river  and a southern block  largely on the west side of the river 
the geology is generally more complex on the east side of the river with beds dipping from northwest to southeast 
the geological setting west of the river tends to be less complex with more gently dipping beds 
most of the development to date in the gurnee field has been on the east side of the river which was near existing infrastructure 
wells drilled to date fall into three major categories wells that exhibit relatively flat production  including some with slight incline or decline 
over of the wells in the field are in this category  wells with high initial water production and little or no gas production  approximately of the wells are in this category and are located primarily in the southern portion of the field  and wells with low water and gas production 
approximately of the wells are in this category 
as to the first category of wells  we believe these wells will eventually incline and that the reserves assigned to them  and possibly more  will be recovered over time 
the exact slope and timing of that incline is difficult to predict 
the high water production from wells in the second category is an indication of good permeability 
we also have high confidence of the gas in place 
as the water production declines we expect these wells to be among the better wells in the field 
as to the third category of wells  we will need to employ new treatments or re completion techniques to improve performance or face downward revisions to proved reserves 
at december   the proved reserves assigned to wells in the third category represented approximately of our total proved reserves 
average daily production per well has remained fairly flat in the gurnee field 
normally we would expect this per well average to increase as production from wells in the field incline 
therefore  until inclines become prevalent  new wells must be drilled for production to increase substantively 
we reduced the annual drilling rate in the gurnee field in and plan to reduce it further in this reduction in drilling is largely responsible for the reduced rate of production growth in the field 
we drilled our first wells on the less geologically complex west side of the river in the southern acreage block in and have recently initiated production testing 
initial results from our first well are encouraging 
however  it is too early to reach any definitive conclusions with regard to the first well  and the second well is just now being put on production 
drivers for future increased production may include several sources new drilling  especially from the west side of the river if initial positive results continue  the dewatering of the high water production wells  or from the commencement of expected incline from the wells with relatively flat production 
we have constructed and operate an approximate mile pipeline from the cahaba basin to the black warrior river for the disposal of produced water under a permit issued by the alabama department of environmental management 
this pipeline had an initial design capacity of approximately  barrels of water per day  but will require additional pump stations and looping a portion of the line in order to meet the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements maximum design capacity if needed 
in october  we executed a series of agreements with a privately held company relating to our operations in the cahaba basin  under which we agreed to designate up to of the pipeline s capacity to dispose of produced water from the company s operations in the gurnee field 
our fees earned under the agreements are per barrel of untreated produced water but may decline to per barrel of produced water if the operator chooses to treat its own produced water prior to sending it to geomet 
the disposal fees we generate are included in other revenues 
we also operate a water treatment facility in the gurnee field to condition the produced water prior to injection into the pipeline and a discharge pond at the river to aerate the water prior to disposal 
we believe that our disposal pipeline and water treatment facility will meet all of our future water disposal requirements for the gurnee field 
additionally  under these agreements  we have secured firm capacity rights on a high pressure gas gathering pipeline which connects into enbridge s magnolia pipeline system 
the acquired rights entitle us to transport approximately million cubic feet per day of coalbed methane gas at a fee of per mmbtu actually gathered through the pipeline 
we do not anticipate utilizing this capacity in the immediate future 
this agreement provides us with a second outlet for our gas produced from the gurnee field 
together with our existing capacity on the southern natural gas bessemer calera lateral  our total gas takeaway capacity is expected to meet all of our future requirements 
we control and operate a mile  inch high pressure steel pipeline and a gas treatment and compression facility through which we gather  dehydrate  and compress our gas for delivery into the southern natural gas pipeline system 
as we control the gathering and delivery pipeline system  we incur no third party costs to gather and deliver our gas to market 
pond creek in the pond creek field in the central appalachian basin of southern west virginia and southwestern virginia  we have the rights to develop approximately  net cbm acres 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves  or bcf  were located within the pond creek field  of which approximately were classified as proved developed and we had developed approximately of our pond creek cbm acreage 
as of december   we were the operator and own a working interest in productive wells and an average of working interest in productive wells in the pond creek field 
net daily sales of gas averaged approximately  mcf for at december   our undeveloped cbm acreage in the pond creek field contained net proved undeveloped locations and additional drilling locations  based predominantly on acre spacing 
in  we intend to spend approximately million of our capital expenditure budget to drill wells in the pond creek field 
we extract gas from up to an average of coal seams within the pocahontas and new river coal formations at depths ranging from feet to  feet 
at these depths overall coal thickness in this area ranges from to feet of low medium volatile bituminous rank pennsylvanian age coal 
prior mining activity revealed that these coal groups are gas rich 
a total of core holes have been drilled on and in the area of our acreage in the central appalachian basin and a geographically extensive gas desorption testing program has been conducted to determine the gas content of the coal and to define the coalbed methane resource under a substantial portion of our leasehold position 
our gas from the pond creek field is gathered into our central dehydration and compression facility and delivered into the jewell ridge pipeline system owned by east tennessee natural gas  llc etng 
in january  we executed two long term firm transportation agreements with etng  which became effective when our pipeline went in service on april   with total maximum daily quantities of  dth and  dth and primary terms of years and years  respectively 
lasher the lasher field is located approximately miles north of the pond creek field 
at december   we had drilled four wells at lasher  and we plan to drill wells in the geological setting at lasher is very 
table of contents 
index to financial statements similar to pond creek except that the coal seams are slightly thinner and shallower 
the lasher field has two significant advantages over pond creek in that a water disposal well and a major interstate pipeline are both located on our leasehold 
we have adequate firm transportation capacity on the pipeline and have recently entered into an interconnect agreement 
we believe that lower development costs  along with the operating efficiencies associated with the close proximity of the water disposal well will allow us to achieve rates of return at lasher that are comparable to the pond creek field 
in  we intend to spend approximately million of our capital expenditure budget to drill wells and to connect these wells along with three of the existing wells to a water and gas gathering system  which is to be installed along with a compressor station and a high pressure gas sales line that will connect into an interstate pipeline that is located on the lasher leasehold 
the proximity of the lasher field to the pond creek field presents several advantages which helps reduce cost and provides operational efficiencies 
this includes using our pond creek project personnel  contractors and vendors to conduct similar operations in the lasher project 
garden city the chattanooga shale  our target in north central alabama  represents an opportunity in close proximity to our existing operations and a natural step out for exploration and development 
based on our initial technical evaluation using the data from several coreholes and gas desorption and other analyses of the cores  this shale prospect has many similarities to our coalbed methane projects  because it is a large resource play at shallow depths with expected low finding and development costs  low production costs and long lived reserves 
although the production characteristics from shale may differ from coalbed methane  a shale play lends itself to multi well  multi year drilling programs where drilling and completion and infrastructure costs can be driven down 
being the first company to operate in this area has allowed us to amass a significant land position and to begin the evaluation process to determine the chattanooga shale s reservoir and production characteristics 
we have acquired approximately  gross acres of leasehold  we own a working interest in the leases and are the operator 
the chattanooga shale is expected to be encountered at an average depth of  to  feet across the prospect area 
we have drilled five core holes to determine the gas in place and the reservoir properties of the shale 
we have also drilled three production wells for the garden city prospect 
we plan to drill at least three more production wells in  at least one of which is expected to be a horizontal well 
we are continuing to lease additional acreage 
initial results have been encouraging but more drilling and production testing is necessary before a decision to develop this prospect can be made 
we plan to drill three wells in and spend approximately million 
the proximity of the garden city prospect to the gurnee field presents several advantages which helps reduce cost and provides operational efficiencies 
this includes using our gurnee project personnel  contractors and vendors to conduct similar operations in the garden city prospect 
peace river the peace river field is located in northeast british columbia near the community of hudson s hope 
we operate this project  which covers approximately  acres of crown tenure rights to earn leases  and own a working interest 
as of year end we had drilled production wells  coreholes and tested several water disposal options 
pending the confirmation of adequate water disposal capacity  we plan to spend up to million of capital in net to our working interest  to drill and complete five new wells  and connect these wells along with three of the existing wells to a water and gas gathering system to be installed with a gas plant compressor station  and a high pressure gas sales line which will connect into the spectra gas transmission line which crosses the property 
consultations with the affected first nations continue and we hope to commence gas sales from the peace river field in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  estimates  and a high degree of uncertainty in the preparation of our financial statements reserves 
our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved gas reserves 
proved gas reserves represent estimated quantities of gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production  and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering  and production data and  the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from year to year  causing estimates of proved reserves to also change 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our unevaluated properties  our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers 
gas properties 
the method of accounting for gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expenses 
we use the full cost method of accounting for gas properties 
under this method  all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of our gas properties are capitalized and segregated into us and canadian cost centers 
gas properties are depleted using the unit of production method 
the depletion expense is significantly affected by the unamortized historical and future development costs and the estimated proved gas reserves 
estimation of proved gas reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
holding all other factors constant  if proved gas reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease  respectively 
subsequent proved reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
we perform a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of our full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
the ceiling test is imposed separately for our us and canadian cost centers 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less related deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our gas properties increases when gas prices are depressed  even if low prices are temporary 
in addition  a write down may occur if estimates of proved gas reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
the ceiling test is calculated using natural gas prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves  however  as allowed by the sec guidelines  significant changes in gas prices subsequent to quarter end are used in the ceiling test 
in addition  
table of contents 
index to financial statements subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations were not included in the computation of the discounted present value of future net revenues for the purposes of the ceiling test calculation 
unevaluated properties 
the costs directly associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and relate to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination together with interest costs capitalized for these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs associated with a specific unevaluated property are transferred to the amortization base with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
any impairments to unevaluated properties are transferred to the amortization base 
future abandonment costs 
we have legal obligations to plug  abandon and dismantle existing wells and facilities that we have acquired  constructed  or developed 
liabilities for asset retirement obligations are recorded at fair value in the period incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  the asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are subsequently allocated to expense as part of our depletion calculation 
additionally  increases in the discounted asset retirement liability resulting from the passage of time are recorded as lease operating expense or capitalized 
estimating the future asset retirement liability requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
we use the present value of estimated cash flows related to our asset retirement obligations to determine the fair value 
present value calculations inherently incorporate numerous assumptions and judgments 
these include the ultimate retirement and restoration costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the carrying cost of the related asset 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our hedging activities consist of derivative instruments entered into to hedge against changes in natural gas prices and changes in interest rates related to outstanding debt under our credit facility primarily through the use of fixed price swap agreements  basis swap agreements  three way collars  and traditional collars 
consistent with our hedging policy  we entered into a series of derivative instruments to hedge a significant portion of our expected natural gas production through and we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge interest rates associated with a portion of our variable rate debt through typically  these derivative instruments require payments to receipts from counterparties based on specific indices as required by the derivative agreements 
these transactions are recorded in our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
l 
although not risk free  we believe this policy will reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and changes in interest rates and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as a result  our derivative instruments are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  all our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings for the natural gas derivatives or other comprehensive income for our interest rate swaps 
the natural gas derivatives have not been designated as hedge transactions while the interest rate swap qualifies and has been designated as perfect hedge 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at the inception of a derivative contract  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged items as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative instrument 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and hedge items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas 
we use the sales method of accounting for the recognition of gas revenue 
because there is a ready market for natural gas  we sell our natural gas shortly after production at various pipeline receipt points at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on our net revenue interests 
gas sold in production operations is not significantly different from our share of production based on our interest in the properties 
settlements of gas sales occur after the month in which the gas was produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the purchaser 
income taxes 
we record our income taxes using an asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates at the end of the period 
under sfas  the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted change 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in stockholder ownership that could trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss nol carryforwards 
it is more likely than not that we will use these nol s to offset current tax liabilities in future years except our canadian nol s 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a consistent threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements stock compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the prospective transition method 
the application of sfas r requires the use of a model similar to the black scholes model to measure the estimated fair value of the options and as a result various assumptions must be made by management that require judgment and the assumptions could be highly uncertain 
the significant assumptions include the expected term  volatility  interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the adoption of sfas r  we expect our compensation expense related to the granting of share based awards subsequent to adoption to be higher than in prior periods 
for awards outstanding as of january   we will continue using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards before adoption 
therefore  no equity compensation cost will be recognized on these awards in the future unless such awards are modified  repurchased or cancelled

conversely  realized gains occur when commodity gas prices go below the derivative floor price 
unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts generated a million loss as compared to a million gain in the prior period 
unrealized losses and gains are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
unrealized gains are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets increase or the fair value of derivative liabilities decrease 
unrealized losses are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets decrease or the fair value of derivative liabilities increase 
the million loss was a result of increased future commodity gas prices 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased by million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt and higher interest rates 
capitalized interest totaled million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease in income tax expense for the current period was due to decreased pretax income compared to the prior period 
in addition  the effective tax rate decreased for the current year to from in the comparable prior period 
the principal driver for the difference in the effective tax rate was due to lower state income taxes resulting from state apportionment factor shifting 
discontinued operations 
in september of  we discontinued the third party marketing business and second reportable segment which had been created in connection with the consolidation of shamrock energy llc  a variable interest entity under fin r on august  the consolidation of the variable interest entity had no impact on our net income due to the minority interest to shamrock energy llc 
on january   we acquired shamrock energy llc as a wholly owned subsidiary and the consolidation of this wholly owned subsidiary had an insignificant impact on our net income 
as a result of exiting our third party marketing business  we are treating these activities as a discontinued operation for all the periods presented

unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts generated a million gain as compared to a million loss in the prior period 
unrealized losses and gains are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
unrealized gains are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets increase or the fair value of derivative liabilities decrease 
unrealized losses are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets decrease or the fair value of derivative liabilities increase 
the million gain was a result of decreased future commodity gas prices 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased by million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding bank balances and was partially offset by higher interest rates 
capitalized interest totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit resulted in an expense of million in the year ended december  compared to a benefit of million in the prior period 
the increase in income tax expense for the year was due to pretax income versus a pretax loss in the prior period and an increase in the effective tax rate for the year to from in the prior period as a result of certain state taxes not previously included in prior periods and the related cumulative non cash adjustment of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity cash flow from operations for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  of million combined together with million borrowed from our revolving credit facility and million from other sources were sufficient to fund our cash basis capital expenditures of million 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  a decrease of million from the working capital deficit of million at december  the decrease in the working capital was primarily a result of capital expenditures 
at december   we had adequate cash flows from operating activities and credit availability to fund our working capital deficits 
the development of cbm fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  and the timing and volume of initial and subsequent natural gas production 
we estimate total capital 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expenditures in will be approximately million with approximately allocated to development projects  representing a decrease of approximately million under our actual capital expenditures 
the estimated capital expenditures are primarily attributable to continued development expenditures at peace river  pond creek  lasher  cahaba and garden city 
as of december  we have approximately million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the following table is a summary of our capital expenditures on an accrual basis by category year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures leasehold acquisition exploration development other items primarily capitalized overhead and interest total capital expenditures capital expenditures for the year ended december  decreased by from the prior year 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease in by from the levels 
the decrease in and is primarily attributable to decreased development expenditures at our gurnee field and pond creek field partially offset by increased expenditures in our other prospects 
the decisions to reduce drilling activity in and were made for several reasons to keep our bank debt at acceptable levels  to allow time to evaluate production results at the gurnee field  to provide additional capital for our other prospects and  as a result of the pond creek field litigation 
the development of coalbed methane fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  the transportation alternatives  and the timing and volume of initial and subsequent natural gas production volumes 
the development of coalbed methane fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  the transportation alternatives  and the timing and volume of initial and subsequent natural gas production volumes 
based upon current expectations  we believe that we will have adequate resources from cash flows provided by operations and from proceeds from our revolving credit facility borrowings to fund our capital expenditures and other working capital needs 
if natural gas commodity prices decrease from their current levels for an extended period  our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be affected negatively 
furthermore  amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility are largely dependent on our level of estimated proved reserves and current natural gas prices 
if either our estimated proved reserves or natural gas prices decrease  amounts available to us to borrow under our revolving credit facility could be negatively affected 
if our cash flows are less than anticipated  amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility are reduced or we are unable to sell equity at acceptable prices  we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures 
commodity price risk and related hedging activities 
we engage in commodity price risk and related hedging activities from time to time 
these activities are intended to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
we have historically used swaps  costless collars and three way costless collars in our hedging activities 
swaps exchange floating price risk in the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements future for a fixed price at the time of the hedge 
costless collars set both a maximum ceiling and a minimum floor future price 
three way costless collars are similar to regular costless collars except that  in order to increase the ceiling price  we agree to limit the amount of the floor price protection to a predetermined amount  generally between and per mmbtu 
in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  all our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings 
the natural gas derivatives have not been designated as hedge transactions under sfas no 
 as amended 
currently  we use collars and fixed price swaps as our mechanism for hedging commodity prices 
during the year ending december   the company recognized gains on derivative contracts of  which included realized gains of  during the year ending december   the company recognized gains on derivative contracts of  which included realized gains of  during the year ending december   the company recognized losses on derivative contracts of  which included realized losses of at december  and at december   the fair values of open natural gas contracts were assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had the following natural gas collar positions period volume mmbtu sold ceiling sold floor bought floor collars way january march summer winter summer traditional collar january march at december   we had the following natural gas swap position period volume in mmbtu s price summer we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market of natural gas may have on the fair value of our natural gas derivative instruments 
at december   the potential change in the fair value of our derivative contracts assuming a increase in the underlying commodity price was a million decrease in the unrealized gain on derivative contracts reported on our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three months ended december  interest rate risks and related hedging activities when we enter into an interest rate swap  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge  at which time we prepare the documentation required under sfas no 
hedges of our interest rate are designated as cash flow hedges based on whether the interest on the underlying debt is converted to a fixed interest rate 
changes in derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to the extent that they are effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we use fixed rate swaps to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the objective of realizing a fixed cash flow stream from these activities

for the years ended december   we recognized no ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges 
on january   the company entered an interest rate swap at an interest rate of and a notional amount of  maturing january  we have reviewed the financial strength of our hedge counterparties and believe our credit risk to be minimal 
our hedge counterparties are participants in our credit agreement and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement is used as collateral for our hedges 
revolving credit facility in june  we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  as agent  and other lenders 
availability under our credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base  which is currently set at million 
the borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations 
the lenders also have the right to require one additional redetermination in any fiscal year 
our credit agreement provides for interest to accrue at a rate calculated  at our option  at either the adjusted base rate which is the greater of the agent s base rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin of to  based on borrowing base usage 
borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets including equity interests in our subsidiaries 
all outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement become due and payable on january  we are subject to financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum current ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
our ratio of consolidated current assets defined to include amounts available under our borrowing base to our consolidated current liabilities is not permitted to be less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  and our ratio of consolidated ebitda for the four preceding quarters at the end of each fiscal quarter to the sum of our consolidated net interest expense for the same period plus letter of credit fees accruing during such quarter is not permitted to be less than to consolidated ebitda as defined in the amended credit agreement excludes other non cash charges deducted in determining net income loss  which would include unrealized losses from the change in the market value of open derivative contracts 
in addition  we are subject to covenants restricting or prohibiting cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities  and liens on properties 
a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our revolving credit facility  including the financial covenants  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders could terminate their commitments to us  and they could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the facility 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement 
in addition  the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is redetermined semi annually and may be redetermined at other times upon request by the lenders under certain circumstances 
redeterminations are based upon a number of factors  including commodity prices and reserve levels 
using our december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements reserve report  the borrowing base was reaffirmed at million as of february  the next scheduled redetermination is to occur as of june  upon a redetermination  we could be required to repay a portion of our bank debt 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments  which could result in a default under the terms of the revolving credit facility and an acceleration of our indebtedness 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
interest on the borrowings averaged per annum 
borrowing availability at december  was million 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility accrues interest at floating or market rates 
fluctuations in market interest rates will cause our interest costs to fluctuate 
based upon the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december   a change in market interest rates would have increased interest expense and negatively impacted our annual cash flows by approximately  note that million of outstanding balance was excluded from the analysis due to lack of interest rate exposure based on the interest rate swap discussed above 
contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business  debt service requirements and operating lease commitments 
the following table summarizes these commitments at december   beginning january  in thousands and thereafter long term debt and other obligations interest expense on revolving credit facility operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations firm transportation contracts other operating commitments fin total commitments maturities based on the june amended bank credit agreement terms  which extended the maturity date to january  assumes an annual rate on a day libor of plus the current margin for a total interest rate of  net of swap recoveries

as of december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately k 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amount of any payments related to this liability because there are currently no outstanding unpaid assessments from any tax authority  and it is likely that assessments would be offset by existing deferred tax attributes as they arise 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we identified  of unrecognized tax 
table of contents 
index to financial statements benefits  largely related to depletion methods used in years prior to from net deferred assets 
there was no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings  our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing fin the amount of unrecognized tax benefit did not materially change as of december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
on february   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb  fasb 
this standard permits an entity to measure financial instruments and certain other items at estimated fair value 
most of the provisions of fasb are elective  however  the amendment to fasb  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities that own trading and available for sale securities 
the fair value option created by fasb permits an entity to measure eligible items at fair value as of specified election dates 
the fair value option a may generally be applied instrument by instrument  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c must be applied to the entire instrument and not to only a portion of the instrument 
fasb is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity i makes that choice in the first days of that year  ii has not yet issued financial statements for any interim period of such year  and iii elects to apply the provisions of fasb  fair value measurements 
we do not believe there will be a material impact related to the implementation of fasb on our financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we began exploratory operations in canada in the fourth quarter of and do not have operations in any other foreign countries 
we do not hedge our foreign currency risk and are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the canadian dollar 
because our canadian project is not yet producing  the effect of changes in the exchange rate does not impact our revenues or expenses but primarily affects the costs of unevaluated properties 
we continue to monitor the foreign currency exchange rate in canada and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended december   a fluctuation in the prices received for natural gas production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
interest rate risk 
we have long term debt subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of december   we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding due in january this variable rate obligation exposes us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be approximately million
