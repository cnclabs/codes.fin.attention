table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that that buys  sells  trades  and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  dvds  video games  video game consoles  and electronics  as well as consumables and trends products such as apparel  t shirts  action figures  posters  greeting cards  and seasonal merchandise through its entertainment stores and its internet web site 
as of january   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores is leased from a third party  is wholly owned by us and is operated under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing stores  opening new stores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates comprise our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly or quarterly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value and returnability of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
through merchandising and an automated progressive markdown program  we quickly take the steps necessary to increase the sell off of slower moving merchandise to eliminate or lessen the effect of these adjustments 

table of contents rental asset depreciation 
we have established rental asset depreciation policies that match rental product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates  based upon our experience  as to the ultimate revenue and the timing of the revenue to be generated from our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is higher when the product is initially released for rental by the studios and declines over time 
in establishing salvage values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and sales volume of our previously rented product and other used product 
we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months or nine months  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over months 
rental assets  which include dvds  books on cd  video games  and vhs  are depreciated to salvage values ranging from to rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
we also review the carrying value of our rental assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we periodically record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolescence or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than our original estimates  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or salvage values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and salvage values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in our customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated our estimates surrounding the useful life and salvage value of our rental assets due to recent changes in our rental business 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful life of rental video games from six months to nine months to better reflect the product s extended rental life 
in addition  we increased the salvage value on rental video games from to to better match the recovery rate on higher cost games released on new gaming systems 
all other rental assets  which include dvds  vhs units  and books on cd  continue to be depreciated on an accelerated basis over six months to salvage values of either for vhs units or for dvd units and books on cd 
as our business continues to change  we will continue to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimates surrounding our rental assets 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements  which are recorded in rental cost of sales on the consolidated statements of earnings  typically include a lower initial product cost with a percentage of the net rental revenues to be shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
any up front costs exceeding the designated salvage value are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as the related revenue is earned 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
the company analyzes titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognizes an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon the company s analysis of the estimated shortfall 
the company revises these estimates on a monthly basis  based on actual results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate poor performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining initial lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 
income taxes 
in determining net income for financial statement purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable income in the year when we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents as of february   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely then not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood  on a cumulative basis  of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
share based compensation 
as of february   we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires us to recognize share based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of earnings 
determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon actual historical stock prices over the expected life of the option 
expected life of the option the estimate of an expected life was calculated based on historical data relating to grants  exercises  and cancellations  as well as the vesting period and contractual life of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option 
our stock price volatility and option lives involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes pricing model and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion or options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
in addition to stock options  we award performance based stock grants 
compensation expense is recognized if management deems it probable that the performance conditions will be met 
management must use their judgment to determine the probability that a performance condition will be met 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  future results could be materially impacted

video game comps increased primarily due to strong sales of video game hardware  including xbox  nintendo wii  and playstation consoles  as well as strong sales of new games for these gaming systems 
comps for the trends department rose due to improved plan o gramming throughout the department and an improved assortment of products 
key categories driving trends included strong sales of apparel  such as backpacks  bags and hats  as well as action figures  collectible card games  and seasonal merchandise 
these drivers were partially offset by lower sales of board games and puzzles resulting from reduced levels of inventory carried for these products 
movie comps increased  which was primarily due to strong sales of used dvds along with increased sales of next generation formats  led by blu ray 
book comps increased during fiscal primarily due to the july release of the seventh and final book in the harry potter series as well as strong sales of used books 
music comps fell  directly as a result of continued industry declines as consumers looked to other forms of music alternatives  primarily through digital downloads 
merchandise comps  excluding the sale of music  increased during fiscal for fiscal  we are projecting a positive total comp in the low single digits for both merchandise and rental sales 
generally  it is difficult for us to project future comp sales 
our comp sales are to a great extent dependent upon the quantity and quality of new releases from the studios  publishers  and hardware manufacturers  as well as general economic conditions and other factors not under our control 

table of contents rental comps decreased from the same period last year due to a weaker slate of box office releases compared to the prior year along with a shift of consumer preference toward buying dvds and games instead of renting

strong sales of mass market and used books offset the negative impact of fewer new release hardback sales primarily attributable to the release of the sixth book in the harry potter series in fiscal but no series releases in fiscal trends comps decreased compared to the same period last year  primarily due to lower sales of collectable card games and apparel  partially offset by strong sales of action figures 
music comps decreased compared to the prior year  primarily due to fewer premier artist cd releases as well as decreased sales of used cds

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations exclusively from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchasing  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental products  opening new stores and expanding reformatting existing stores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments  except for the stock buyback programs more fully discussed below 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new stores and store expansions reformations through fiscal at january   total outstanding debt was million 
we project our outstanding debt levels for fiscal to be similar to that at january  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash flows from operating activities increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net income increased million during fiscal  as compared to a decrease of million during fiscal rental asset depreciation expensed decreased million  to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease resulted from lower rental receipts during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
merchandise inventories decreased million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal as a result of continued improvements in purchasing and selection management 
the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million is primarily due to a decrease in the amounts of accrued salaries at the end of fiscal as compared to the prior year  partially offset by an increase in the amount of deferred gift card revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal accounts payable increased million for the year  compared to a decrease of million during fiscal the increase in accounts payable during fiscal was due to the timing of non inventory related payables 
the company purchased and paid for merchandise to build for the holiday season earlier in fiscal as compared to the current period  which led to lower accounts payable during the prior year 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was the result of decreased capital expenditures related to remodeled or relocated stores 
in fiscal  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  million of which relates to the reformatting of existing stores  which will include changes to the music  trends  and children s book departments 
financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under our revolving credit facility described below under capital structure 
for fiscal  cash used in financing activities was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal  primarily resulting from net repayments on our revolving credit facility during fiscal of approximately million compared to net borrowings for fiscal of approximately million 
additionally  the company purchased million of treasury stock in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal on september   we announced a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
since that time  the board of directors has approved additional increases in the amounts of million on april   million on march   million on october   and million on november  during fiscal year  we purchased a total of  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million  or per share 
as of january   a total of  shares had been purchased under the program at a cost of approximately million  for an average cost of approximately per share 
as of january   approximately million remains available for repurchases under the stock repurchase program 

table of contents capital structure 
we have a syndicated secured loan and security agreement with fleet retail finance  inc due to the acquisition of fleet retail finance by bank of america  on january   we executed an amendment to our secured loan and security agreement which changed ownership of the revolving credit facility from fleet retail finance to bank of america 
the amount outstanding under the facility is limited by a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory  as defined in the facility  and certain rental assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and is limited to a ceiling of million  less a million availability reserve  as amended 
the facility permits borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margin depending upon the level of our minimum availability 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental assets net of accumulated amortization less specifically defined reserves  which can be adjusted to reduce availability under the facility

the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiaries and is guaranteed by each of our consolidated subsidiaries 
unless the facility is amended and the maturity extended  the facility matures on august  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
however  excess availability may be reduced in the future as changes in the borrowing base occur or the lenders increase availability reserves 
the average rate of interest being charged under the facility for fiscal years ending january  and was and  respectively

the aggregate amount of the letters of credit at january  was approximately million  which reduces the excess availability under the facility 
at january   our minimum lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through was approximately million as of january  
table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   other than operating leases and standby letters of credit  we had not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or third party guarantees  nor is it our business practice to do so 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands to to more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt principal only operating leases revenue sharing total based on our internal forecasts  we estimate interest payments for fy to be approximately million 
amounts include the direct lease obligations  excluding any taxes  insurance  maintenance and other related expenses 
for the fiscal year ended january   payments for taxes  insurance  maintenance  and other related expenses  which are variable in nature  were approximately million 
as of january   we were a party to revenue sharing arrangements with various studios 
these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues recorded during fiscal fin obligations including unrecognized tax benefits of  and accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   were not included in this table 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of any future cash outflows related to fin liabilities  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option
