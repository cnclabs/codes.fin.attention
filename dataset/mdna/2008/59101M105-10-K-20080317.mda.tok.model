item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel drugs by applying our proprietary technologies  scientific expertise and unique capabilities for targeting the liver and liver pathways 
we have established a broad pipeline of product candidates and advanced research programs targeting large markets with significant unmet needs 
our product pipeline includes product candidates and advanced research programs for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia  which we refer to as our core assets  as well as product candidates and advanced research programs for the treatment of liver diseases such as hepatitis and primary liver cancer  which we refer to as our non core assets 
all of our product candidates were developed internally using our proprietary technologies 
we currently have four product candidates at the clinical stage of development 
these product candidates include our core metabolic disease product candidates  mb and mb  which are being developed as potential treatments for type diabetes and hyperlipdemia  respectively  and our non core liver disease product candidates  pradefovir and mb  which have been developed as potential treatments for hepatitis b and primary liver cancer  respectively 
recent events in january  we announced interim results from a rising multiple dose phase b clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mb in healthy volunteers with modestly elevated ldl cholesterol 
this ongoing trial indicated that mb was safe and well tolerated at the first four doses studied 
this has allowed us to continue increasing the dose and the dosing of a fifth dose cohort was completed successfully and a sixth group of patients is currently underway 
although not the primary end point of the study  we also evaluated the efficacy of mb in the first four dose cohorts each cohort included eight volunteers  two on placebo and six who received mb 
while these observations should be considered preliminary  the results were encouraging with clinically relevant reductions in ldl cholesterol and tg levels observed relative to the changes seen in patients treated with placebo 
we expect to complete this study in in the third quarter of  we announced that our lead metabolic disease product candidate for treating type diabetes  cs  failed to significantly lower the placebo adjusted level of hbac  a measure of glucose load  at the doses tested  in a phase b clinical trial conducted by our former development partner on cs  daiichi sankyo 
further clinical evaluation of cs was discontinued and in january we and daiichi sankyo agreed to terminate our strategic collaboration and all rights to this product candidate were returned to us 
subsequent analysis of the data from the phase b study showed that cs significantly lowered both hemoglobin ac and fasting plasma glucose in certain patient sub populations over the three month dosing period evaluated 
these results confirmed the product candidate s mechanism of action and were consistent with the efficacy seen in previous phase a clinical trials 
further  our analysis indicated that concerns raised in prior clinical trials regarding cs s tolerability may have led to it being under dosed by daiichi sankyo at the and mg doses evaluated 
this under dosing  combined with cs s previously identified tendency to produce variable active drug levels from patient to patient  may have led to its failure to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of this phase b clinical trial 
while the trial s primary efficacy endpoint was not met  cs was determined to be safe and well tolerated in this phase b clinical trial at the doses tested 
we have designed our second generation fbpase inhibitor  mb  with certain improvements that we believe have the potential to address the shortcomings seen to date with cs  including those that may have contributed to its failure to achieve the above described phase b efficacy endpoint 
these improvements include improved oral bioavailability  metabolic stability and once daily dosing  which we believe could lead to better tolerability and improved efficacy 
we believe that results from our currently ongoing phase a clinical trial of mb may provide initial evidence of its improved profile relative to cs because we believe that mb has a superior product profile and is now approximately at the same stage of clinical development as cs  we have decided to concentrate our future clinical development efforts related to fbpase inhibitors on mb and not cs  even though we now possess full worldwide development and commercialization rights to both compounds 
we are currently independently developing mb in addition  in september we entered into an agreement with schering and valeant to terminate our agreements for the development and commercialization of pradefovir  our product candidate for the treatment of hepatitis b 
in connection with this agreement  all rights to pradefovir were transferred back to us subject to certain milestone and royalty payments we may be required to make to valeant should this product candidate be subsequently developed 
these agreements were terminated as a result of numerous factors  which may include recently reported adverse month oral carcinogenicity studies of pradefovir in rats and mice  which we are currently evaluating 
at this time  we do not intend to independently develop pradefovir and intend to license this product candidate for further development and commercialization  pending the outcome of our aforementioned evaluation 
revised strategic plan as a result of certain of these events  we re evaluated our business strategy and revised our strategic plan 
under our revised strategic plan we will focus our internal resources primarily on our clinical and advanced research core metabolic disease programs 
this includes funding the further clinical evaluation of our core assets  mb and mb  with a focus on achieving key milestones 
continued development of these core assets thereafter will require significant resources 
therefore  we plan to establish strategic collaborations for these core assets at appropriate times to secure additional resources  accelerate progress and share risk 
in addition  we plan to advance additional metabolic disease product candidates discovered by our research group into clinical development either independently  or potentially with current or future strategic collaborators 
in order to reduce future expenses and to minimize the potential dilution associated with financing internal development  we intend to license pradefovir and mb for further development and commercialization 
our revised strategic plan has the potential to significantly reduce current and future expenses and to provide additional financial resources by selectively funding only our core assets  licensing or selling our non core assets  seeking to offset current and future advanced research and clinical costs via additional strategic collaborations on our core advanced research and clinical programs  and utilizing our existing financing facilities  such as the ceff and venture debt 
we believe that these measures  if successful  along with our existing resources will be sufficient to execute our revised strategic plan 
history of losses  prior funding we have incurred annual net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect to incur losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our current and future core metabolic disease clinical development candidates  participate in the commercialization of our product candidates  if any  that receive regulatory approval and for which we retain commercialization rights  and continue and potentially expand our research and development programs 
we have a limited history of operations and  to date  we have not generated any product revenues 
in addition to our initial public offering in june  our private placement of common stock and warrants in october and our registered direct offering of common stock in march  we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of preferred stock as well as direct payments of sponsored research funding  license fees  milestone payments  equity investments from collaborative partners and  to a lesser extent  the sale of common stock through our stockholder approved equity incentive plans 
commercial  manufacturing rights  risks we currently do not have strategic collaborations in place related to our core assets  mb or mb  and we intend to license our non core assets  pradefovir and mb we retain worldwide commercialization rights to all of the compounds that we have generated from our past and current research programs  with the exception of any potential future product candidates covered by our collaborations with merck and idenix 
our potential future agreements with strategic collaborators may include joint marketing or promotion arrangements which may allow us to eventually co market one or more of our product candidates through our own sales force or with a co promotion partner 
alternatively  we may grant exclusive marketing rights to our collaborators in exchange for up front fees  milestones and royalties on future sales  if any 
we will rely on our collaborators or third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for clinical studies and large scale commercialization upon their approval 
since we do not currently possess the resources necessary to independently develop and commercialize all of the potential product candidates that may be based upon our technologies  we plan to enter into additional collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of some or all of our product candidates 
however  our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of new collaborations on acceptable terms  if at all  or it may take longer than expected to establish new collaborations  leading to development and commercialization delays 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory review and approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  reliance on third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of cash and stock based compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs associated with the development and clinical trials of our product candidates  facility costs  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our development activities are focused on the clinical development of our core metabolic disease assets  mb and mb our activities related to our non core liver disease assets  pradefovir and mb  are currently limited to planning  consultation  design and other efforts preparatory to their potential future clinical development by licensees 
in addition  our research activities include work on a variety of compounds in our other advanced research programs 
we are responsible for all costs incurred for our product candidates and our advanced research programs with the exception of the ampk program partnered with merck and the hepatitis c programs partnered with merck and idenix 
our ampk collaboration with merck seeks to develop and commercialize new products to treat type diabetes and potentially other metabolic diseases 
under the terms of our ampk collaboration agreement with merck  we have received approximately million in cumulative sponsored research and license fees funding through december  and are entitled to receive an additional  of funding through the remaining sponsored research term ending in june our collaborations with merck and idenix seek to develop and commercialize new products for treating hepatitis c infection 
our efforts and internal costs related to the hepatitis c collaboration with merck ceased upon completion of its research term in december under the terms of the merck agreement  we have received approximately million in cumulative license fees and sponsored research funding through december  our efforts and internal costs related to the hepatitis c collaboration with idenix ceased upon completion of its research term in october under the terms of this agreement  we have received approximately million in cumulative license fees and sponsored research funding through december  the funded research phase of the hepatitis c collaborations are completed 
merck is currently evaluating certain candidate compounds discovered during the collaboration to determine if one or more will be recommended for clinical development 
idenix is currently evaluating this program for further development 
merck and idenix are solely responsible for conducting and funding all development work for compounds resulting from these collaborations and for commercializing any resulting products 
if a product is successfully developed  we will receive substantial milestone payments as well as receive a portion of the revenue from sales of a drug in the form of a royalty on net sales 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
other than costs for outsourced services associated with our clinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we continue the development of our core assets  as well as continue to expand our research programs 
generally  phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months  phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months and phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months 
however  clinical development timelines vary widely  as do the total costs of clinical trials and the likelihood of success 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing mb and mb through clinical development  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  our ongoing assessment of its market potential and consideration of our available financial resources 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and the compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material unfavorable effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when or if any net cash inflow due to sales of any of our current product candidates will commence 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  investor relations  information systems  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  depreciation and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
other income  net other income  net includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  net of interest expense 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition and eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our agreements generally contain multiple elements  including access to our proprietary technologies and research and development services 
payments under our collaborations are generally made in the form of up front license fees  milestone payments and downstream royalties 
all fees are nonrefundable 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and collaborator funding  if any  of our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront  nonrefundable fees under our collaborations are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
nonrefundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
amounts received for sponsored research funding are recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
amounts received for sponsored research funding for a specific number of full time researchers are recognized as revenue as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
clinical trial expenses 
our clinical trials are often conducted under contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the actual level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment are accrued when known 
if contracted amounts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
stock based compensation 
we grant equity based awards under three stockholder approved share based compensation plans 
we may grant options and restricted stock awards to employees  directors and consultants under our amended and restated equity incentive plan 
we also grant awards to non employee directors under our non employee directors stock option plan 
all of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan which provides a means for employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which we adopted effective january  we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
our results of operations for fiscal and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
share based compensation expense recognized as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we had a deferred stock compensation balance of million at december  for options previously issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant which was eliminated against additional paid in capital as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton  or black scholes option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
expected volatility is based on the weighted average volatility of our stock factoring in daily share price observations and the historical price volatility of certain peers within our industry sector 
in computing expected volatility  the length of the historical period used is equal to the length of the expected term of the option and the share purchase right 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period  as permitted under the simplified method  under sab no 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  beginning with our fiscal year  although earlier application is encouraged 
we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as debt issuance costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  beginning with our fiscal year 
we currently are determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot estimate the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the consensus requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf issue no 
is effective for new contracts entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf issue no 
is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of the annual period beginning after december  we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased license fee and sponsored research revenues as a result of a million increase in revenues from our hepatitis c collaboration with idenix and the million up front license fee received from schering in connection with the collaboration agreement for the development of pradefovir 
absent any changes to our existing collaborations with merck or idenix and if we are unable to generate significant or additional revenues from new strategic collaborations on our non core assets or research programs  we expect a decrease in sponsored research and license revenues in compared to as the sponsored research portion of our agreement with idenix ended in october  our collaboration with schering for the development of pradefovir was terminated in september and the sponsored research portion of our ampk collaboration with merck is scheduled to be completed in june research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of million in clinical development expense for mb  mb and mb  an increase of million in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  a million increase in stock based compensation costs and  in increased occupancy costs and depreciation expense 
we expect costs in research and development in to continue at approximately the same rate as in as we continue to advance mb and mb through clinical development 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase primarily relates to an increase of  in increased payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  an increase of  in occupancy related costs and depreciation expense  and increased stock based compensation expense of  as a result of additional grants made during fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses in to continue at approximately the same rate as in net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due to lower interest income as a result of decreasing average cash balances for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in our average cash balances were higher in as compared to due to the net proceeds from our march stock offering 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the  increase was mainly due to increased license fee and sponsored research revenues of approximately million from our ampk collaboration with merck  which began in the second half of this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in sponsored research revenues from our hepatitis c collaboration with merck  the research portion of which was completed in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of million in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  a million increase in clinical development expense for mb  mb and mb  a million increase in occupancy costs related to our new facility  increased travel  supplies and insurance expense and an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase primarily relates to an increase of million in professional services related to legal costs associated with patent and corporate related matters and consulting services  increased stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r  higher payroll and related benefits costs of  as a result of a higher average number of employees in and increased travel  occupancy and public company costs of  net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to increased interest income as a result of higher average cash balances for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as well as increased yields on investments 
our average cash balances were higher in as compared to due to the net proceeds from our october and march stock offerings 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with million in private equity financings and million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in june  a private placement of common stock and warrants in october and a registered direct offering of common stock in march in april  we filed an additional shelf registration statement to increase the amount of common stock and warrants available for issuance under our existing shelf registration statement by approximately million to a total of million  subject to certain limitations relating to the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates 
the additional shelf registration statement was declared effective in may we have entered into a ceff with an institutional investor  under the terms of which  the investor is committed to providing us up to million in funding from time to time for a period up to months that commenced in december through the purchase of newly issued shares of our common stock 
in february  the ceff was amended to reduce the minimum market capitalization required to permit a draw down and to eliminate certain termination rights maintained by the investor  among other things 
under the amended ceff  we may access capital  subject to certain conditions  under this facility in tranches of up to the lesser of million or of our market capitalization if  at the time of the draw down of such tranche  our market capitalization equals or exceeds million but is less than million  of our market capitalization if  at the time of the draw down of such tranche  our market capitalization equals or exceeds million but is less than million  and of our market capitalization if  at the time of the draw down of such tranche  our market capitalization equals or exceeds million 
if our market capitalization is less than million  we will not have access to this capital 
the investor will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the ceff at discounts ranging from to  depending on the average market price of our common stock during an eight day pricing period  provided that the minimum acceptable purchase price for any shares to be issued to the investor during the eight day pricing period is determined by the higher of or of our share price the day before the commencement of each draw down 
pursuant to the agreement we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued in connection with this transaction  which became effective on december  in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds in a registered direct offering involving the sale of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
placement agency fees and other offering expenses were approximately million 
in october  we raised gross proceeds of approximately million in a private placement of common stock and the concurrent issuance of warrants for the purchase of common stock 
placement agent fees and other offering expenses were approximately million 
under the terms of the financing  we sold million shares of common stock at per share  the closing bid price for our common stock immediately preceding the entering into of the binding agreement for the transaction 
we also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the closing  investors in the financing paid an additional purchase price equal to per each share issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in which we sold approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in july  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option  resulting in the sale of an additional  shares of common stock  which resulted in proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
additionally  we have received cumulative proceeds from collaborative arrangements with strategic partners for the development of certain core assets  non core assets  for the application of our technologies on third party programs and to a lessor extent from small business innovation research  or sbir  grant funding totaling approximately million through december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily a result of net cash used in operations of million offset by  of net cash flows provided by financing activities 
as of december   we have financed through leases and loans the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
the loans are collateralized with the purchased equipment  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to  and are due in monthly installments through october until additional funding sources are available  we plan to limit the use of our cash reserves for leasehold improvements and capital equipment necessary to support our clinical development efforts and research programs for under our revised strategic plan we will focus our internal resources primarily on our core metabolic disease clinical and advanced research programs 
this includes funding the further clinical evaluation of our core assets  mb and mb  with a focus on achieving key milestones 
continued development of these core assets thereafter will require significant resources 
therefore  we plan to establish strategic collaborations for these product candidates at appropriate times to secure additional resources  accelerate progress and share risk 
in addition  we plan to advance additional metabolic disease product candidates discovered by our research group into clinical development either independently or potentially with current or future strategic collaborators 
in order to reduce future expenses and to minimize the potential dilution associated with financing their internal development  we intend to license pradefovir and mb for further development and commercialization 
we intend to use our existing cash reserves  proceeds received in march from our venture debt facility  proceeds from our ongoing collaboration with merck  our ceff and proceeds from other planned financing and business development activities to execute our revised strategic plan through under our revised strategic plan we will need to secure additional cash proceeds through future strategic collaborations  the ceff or other financing sources to fund certain studies on the mb and mb programs in in the event we are not able to generate sufficient financing through the use of our ceff or other planned financing and business development activities we have the ability and intent to  and will be required to  delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs and other outlays of cash in order to meet our cash requirements through we may not be successful in obtaining additional collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under current or future agreements 
additionally  we may be required to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
no assurances can be made that additional funding  through any resources including our ceff  will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use or sales of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
failure to obtain adequate financing and to curtail or delay cash expenditures adequately will have a significant negative impact on our future operations 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year to years to years after years operating leases      equipment financing    interest on equipment financing purchase commitments   capital leases interest on capital leases we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we will make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
in addition  under certain agreements  we may be subject to penalties in the event we prematurely discontinue performance under these agreements 
at this time  due to the variability associated with these agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur 
we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees that  under certain circumstances  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when the company has met its obligations under these agreements 
as of december   no events have occurred resulting in the obligation of any such payments 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include but are not limited to the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development and research programs we pursue  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
environmental risk our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials 
we incurred approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  of costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities 
we do not invest in auction rate securities 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our current investment balance by approximately  annually 
while changes in our interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our long term capital lease obligations bears interest at fixed rates and therefore we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to these obligations
