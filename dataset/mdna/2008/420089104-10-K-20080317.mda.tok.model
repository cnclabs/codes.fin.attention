item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through our subsidiaries  we operate in two reportable segments friction products and performance racing 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  general customer demand for our products  competition  raw material pricing and availability  labor relations with our personnel  political conditions in the countries in which we operate and general economic conditions 
we sell a wide range of products that have a corresponding range of gross margins 
our consolidated gross profit margin is affected by product mix  selling prices  material and labor costs  as well as our ability to absorb overhead costs resulting from fluctuations in demand for our products 
in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our precision components segment to focus our corporate resources on our friction products and performance racing segments 
on february   we completed the sale of the precision components segment for approximately million consisting of million in cash and the assumption by the purchaser of million in debt 
we restated our results of operations for this segment to reclassify its net operations  assets and liabilities as discontinued for all periods presented in this report and their results are not included in this discussion of our results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our motor segment  with operations in monterrey  mexico and alton  illinois 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain fixed assets and the land and building of our alton  illinois facility 
on march  we entered into an agreement to sell the monterrey  mexico operations 
the transaction was finalized in the fourth quarter of as a result  there are no remaining assets or liabilities of the motor segment classified as discontinued operations in our december  and december  consolidated balance sheets 
also  in the fourth quarter of we committed to a restructuring program to achieve cost savings in our friction products segment by moving operations at our brook park  ohio location to a new production facility in tulsa  oklahoma 
manufacturing in the oklahoma facility began in late and the facility became operational in additionally  we completed the closure of our brook park  ohio operation during the fourth quarter of in connection with the closure of the ohio facility  we reported pre tax restructuring costs of million million is included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  related to relocation and employee severance expenses 
in  our income from operations was million  an increase of million or  from the million reported in this increase in operating income was primarily the result of pricing actions that began to take effect in the last half of  margin improvement from volume related absorption of fixed overhead  product mix and continued operating improvements at our domestic operating facilities  particularly tulsa 
our operating income was negatively affected by million of legal expense  net of insurance reimbursement  related to the sec and doj investigations as well as increased employee incentive compensation costs in compared to non gaap financial measures in our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  we may refer to financial measures which are considered to be non gaap financial measures under the rules and regulations of the sec 
the non gaap financial measure used by us is adjusted income from operations 
this measure is reconciled to the most comparable gaap financial measure in tables presented in this section of this form k 
this non gaap financial measure is defined by us as income from operations as presented in our consolidated statements of operations  plus a goodwill impairment charge  restructuring and loan forgiveness costs  less income from a reversal of a post retirement benefit liability 
we use this measure to more accurately gauge the ongoing day to day operating activities of our business 
in the fourth quarter of  based on an independent assessment of our performance racing segment and its present and future operations  we recognized a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million 
as a result of our decision to relocate one of our friction products manufacturing facilities to tulsa  oklahoma from ohio  we incurred significant restructuring costs related to this event that impacted our financial results for this restructuring program was completed as of december  the loan forgiveness expense resulted from a one time  non recurring action taken by our compensation committee on january   approving the forgiveness of the shareholder notes of two of our senior executive officers 
the action required the full forgiveness of the shareholder notes by july   if specific operating targets were met 
based on our performance  the remaining outstanding loan balance was forgiven in march additionally  we reported income in the third quarter of as a result of a reduction in an actuarially computed post retirement benefit liability no longer owed by us 
there were no comparable restructuring costs  loan forgiveness costs  or other non cash income relating to the reversal of a pension liability during or we have presented this non gaap financial measure because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of isolated factors underlying that performance 
in addition  our chief operating decision makers use this measure in monitoring and evaluating both our overall performance and the ongoing performance of each of our business segments 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered an alternative to measures required by gaap 
outlook for based on our current view of the markets we serve  we believe that our net sales will increase between and to between million and million compared to net sales of million 
we anticipate continued strength in the majority of the markets we serve in based on general market conditions and our expanded sales initiatives in asia  russia and india 
we expect the truck market to recover modestly coming off of a soft year which was affected by reduced sales due to the large volume of new truck sales in advance of the emission standards change at the end of our construction and mining and agriculture markets continue to be strong 
we expect to benefit in north america as a result of the recently enacted tax relief measures which should result in increased equipment purchases  and worldwide we expect to benefit because of overall worldwide strength in commodities and infrastructure needs 
we anticipate that our aircraft market will show modest growth in we expect that our margins will benefit from the incremental sales volume  and continued emphasis on improving our operational efficiency both domestically and abroad 
partially offsetting this improvement will be inflationary pressures 
although we believe that through fixed price contracts we have protection in against commodity pricing fluctuations on many critical raw material components consumed in our manufacturing process  we are experiencing increases in the cost of steel that leave us exposed to market conditions 
we may be able to pass some of these price increases through to our customers  but we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in passing these costs increases to our customers or that we will be able to increase prices in a timely fashion 
as we continue to expand our operations and put into effect our strategic initiatives  we anticipate hiring additional engineering  sales and operational expertise that will require an investment in these areas as compared to we expect our income from operations to increase to to a range of million to million from million in we believe our effective tax rate will be in a range similar to our effective tax rate of 
we continue to explore options to utilize our current cash holdings  including acquisitions  although we cannot predict the timing of any potential acquisition or the impact that it may have on our earnings 
we anticipate accelerating our investment rate on internal projects 
our capital expenditure budget for is million and will be used primarily to increase capacity  to continue our lean manufacturing projects  and for equipment expenditures for our fuel cell and carbon composite product line initiatives 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million in critical accounting policies some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in applying these policies  we use our best judgment to determine the underlying assumptions that are used in calculating the estimates that affect the reported values on our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we consider relevant 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
however  historically our estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
our critical accounting policies include the following marketable securities 
marketable securities other than cash and cash equivalents included available for sale debt securities 
as of december   we accounted for all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we report our available for sale securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet with unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
dividend and interest income  including the amortization of any discount or premium  as well as realized gains or losses  are included in interest income in our consolidated statement of operations 
we periodically evaluate our investments for other than temporary impairment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has transferred to our customer 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we did not record any impairment charges to our tangible or indefinite lived intangible assets in the periods ended december    or pension benefits 
effective december   we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and which requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and the recognition of changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
pension expense continues to be recognized in the financial statements on an actuarial basis 
the most significant elements in determining our net pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and appropriate discount rates 
we assumed that the expected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets would be for based on our existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  we believe that our assumption of future returns is reasonable 
however  should the rate of return differ materially from our assumed rate  we could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of our plans and our future pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this calculation produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in net pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is recorded to comprehensive income 
net periodic benefit cost was million for the period ended december   and million for the period ended december  we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at their measurement date  december the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected net pension expense 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate  taxes payable and other tax assets and liabilities reflect the current tax rates in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting and income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate is substantially driven by the impact of the mix of our foreign and domestic income and losses and the federal and local tax rate differences on each 
we have adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an amendment of fasb statement no 
fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we were not required to recognize any change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of january   was million  the recognition of which would have an effect of million on our effective tax rate 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we had no interest and penalties in continuing operations income tax expense for the year ended december sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  provides certain guidelines to follow in making the determination of the need for a valuation allowance 
we must demonstrate that taxable income is expected to be available for future periods sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary differences and carryforwards to avoid recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance for our canadian subsidiary for the year ended december  we have determined that no additional valuation allowance was necessary as of december  foreign currency translation and transactions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using period end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
other comprehensive income loss included translation gains of million for the period ended december  gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
sales or purchases in foreign currencies  other than the subsidiary s local currency  are exchanged at the date of the transaction 
the effect of transaction gains or losses is included in other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we reported foreign currency transaction gains for the period ended december   of million 
foreign currency transaction gains or losses were not material to the results of operations for the periods ended december   and recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r modifies the accounting for business combinations by requiring that acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at fair value  contingent consideration arrangements be recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition and pre acquisition contingencies will generally be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value 
the pronouncement also requires that transaction costs be expensed as incurred  acquired research and development be capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset and the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities be met at the acquisition date in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting 
sfas r is required to be adopted prospectively effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas r may not be adopted early 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it applies whenever existing accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements

in the fourth quarter of we committed to selling our precision components segment 
on february   we sold the precision components segment

in accordance with us gaap  we have accounted for both of these business segments in our financial statements on the line item discontinued operations  net of tax 
the following is a summary of the results of discontinued operations for the years ended december  and an analysis of discontinued operations is contained in note discontinued operations in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
year ended december dollars in millions income from discontinued operations  before income taxes income tax expense income from discontinued operations  after income taxes net income loss 
as a result of the factors noted above  we reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in liquidity and capital resources our primary financing requirements are for capital expenditures for maintenance  replacement and acquisition of equipment  expansion of capacity  productivity improvements  research and product development  for funding our day to day working capital requirements  and to pay interest on  and to repay principal of  our indebtedness 
historically  our primary source of funds for conducting our business activities and servicing our indebtedness has been cash generated from operations and borrowings under our bank facility and our senior notes 
recently  we also have available to us the sale proceeds of the precision components segment 
the following selected measures of liquidity and capital resources outline various metrics that are reviewed by our management and are provided to our stockholders to enhance the understanding of our business 
selected measures of liquidity and capital resources from continuing operations december dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital current ratio to to net debt as a of capitalization average number of days sales in accounts receivable days days average number of days sales in inventory days days working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities 
current ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities 
net debt is defined as long term debt  including current portion  and short term borrowings  less cash and marketable securities 
capitalization is defined as net debt plus shareholders equity 
the overall increase in cash and cash equivalents between these periods is primarily due to the sale of our precision components segment during the first quarter of  and the corresponding receipt of the cash purchase price 
in addition  our continuing operations generated million of operating cash flows during during  we invested a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our precision components segment in marketable securities 
as of december   we reported million of investments in cash and cash equivalents and million of investments in marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our investments generally have a maturity of six months or less at the date of purchase 
the longest maturity date for marketable securities held by us as of december  is may  as part of our working capital management program  we review working capital measures on a continuous basis 
the million decrease in our net working capital from december  resulted primarily from increased accounts payable levels to meet first quarter customer demands offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory related to sales volume 
our accounts receivable and inventory levels are reviewed through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at december   was days compared to days at december  the increase is mainly attributable to increased sales volumes during the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable prior period  causing the ratio to increase 
we have not experienced any significant change in accounts receivable collectibility 
average inventory days decreased to days at december   as compared to days at december  our overall inventory investment has increased approximately million for the period ended december   as compared to levels  primarily to meet increased customer demands for the first quarter of debt the following table summarizes the components of our indebtedness december dollars in millions short term debt senior notes bank facility other total debt on august   we redeemed million of senior notes under the terms of our indenture relating to our senior notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in seeking to minimize the risks and costs associated with market risk  we manage our exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financial activities and through foreign currency hedge contracts 
we had no foreign currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at december   none of our total outstanding debt bore interest at a variable rate 
typically  our primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
our cash is primarily invested in bank deposits  money market funds and other marketable debt securities 
the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
our investments in money market funds and marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and our financial condition and results operations could be affected due to movements in interest rates 
due to the short term nature of these investments  a change in market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on an annual basis as of december  the interest rates on our long term debt reflect market rates and therefore  the carrying value of long term debt approximates fair value 
an analysis of our obligations is further discussed in note financing arrangements and note lease obligations in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the following table presents our total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations unrecognized tax benefit short term debt bank facility senior notes capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit this contractual obligations table does not include our defined benefit pension obligations 
an analysis of our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans is contained in note employee benefits in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
this contractual obligations table does not include deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
the above table includes accrued interest and penalties 
the above table table does not include approximately of unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded in other long term accrued expenses in accordance with fin these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably predict whether any specific taxing jurisdiction will select our tax returns to review so it is impractical to determine the amounts that may impact future cash flows 
see note income taxes in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k for further analysis of our fin liabilities 
variable rate obligations the senior notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum or million per year 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for inventory purchases  services and capital expenditures under purchase order 
inflation risk 
we manage our inflation risks by ongoing review of product selling prices and production costs 
in spite of the recent surcharges and price increases on a number of our raw materials  we historically have been able to pass these increased costs to our customers  though we do experience a delay between our cost increases and sales price increases 
currently  we do not believe that inflation risks are material to our business  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
we have operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in euros  canadian dollars  and chinese yuan 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
we do not expect that our unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december   will result in a significant impact on our earnings or cash flows 
we also monitor exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which hawk operates and have periodically entered into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure 
as of december   we have no derivative instruments outstanding
