item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and have identified the policies relating to the following areas as those that are significant to our financial statement presentation  and require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments revenue recognition capitalized product development costs valuation of our deferred income taxes valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets our discussion of these policies is intended to supplement  but not replace  the more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies and disclosures contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from three sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our online  web based products  license revenues from non cancelable perpetual license agreements  and related professional and support services and other revenue 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended and modified  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
because we also provide our products on a subscription basis via access to our hosted computing facilities we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  access to our online subscription products have been provided to the customer or the perpetual courseware has been delivered  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and the collectability of the fee is probable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
revenue from the sale of software under subscription arrangements is recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period starting the later of the first day of the subscription period or when all revenue recognition criteria identified above have been met 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

table of contents we also provide professional services  including consulting  training  and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training  and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately upon delivery where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable 
software support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company allocates the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
if collectability of the fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as payments are received from the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as the payments become due provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
capitalized product development costs 
our investments in product development are significant  and the rules that govern how these costs are accounted for in our financial statements can have a significant impact on our operating results from period to period 
our product development activities relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our software products 
costs related to the initial design and development of new products and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products are expensed as incurred 
when projects reach technological feasibility we begin capitalization of the related project costs 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions 
we evaluate our capitalized costs on a quarterly basis to determine if the unamortized cost related to any product  or group of products  exceeds its estimated net realizable value 
estimating net realizable value requires us to use judgment in projecting future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and thereby quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows realized could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our software product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
our analysis as of october  resulted in an impairment charge of these assets of million 
our analysis as of october  did not result in an impairment charge 
in the third quarter of  we changed our estimate of the useful lives of platform  math and science products released after the second quarter from three years to four years on the basis that these products are projected to have longer useful lives 
all other product amortization periods have remained at three years 
the effect of the policy change on our results was not material 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
our accounting policy for the valuation of deferred income taxes is considered critical for several reasons 
significant judgment is required in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
in addition  income tax accounting rules  in 
table of contents combination with purchase accounting rules applied in the acquisition of lightspan in  result in a complex tax accounting situation in which we currently do not recognize tax benefits on operating losses or on the realization of deferred tax assets  but regardless of our operating results  recognize tax expense on future tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill 
the majority of our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards which are available to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards include those acquired in the acquisition of lightspan in  as well as carryforward losses that existed prior to  or were incurred after  the acquisition 
our ability to realize the benefit of these loss carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
at the time of the acquisition  our history of cumulative operating losses  including those at lightspan prior to the acquisition  was evidence that we would not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of carryforward losses 
as a result  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at that time and  under purchase accounting rules  the write off was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
excluded from our calculation of net deferred tax assets is a deferred tax liability related to tax deductible goodwill 
the timing of the reversal of this difference is considered indefinite because it will not reverse until the underlying assets that created the goodwill are disposed of or sold 
accordingly  this timing difference cannot be used to support the realization of other deferred tax assets which have definite lives 
our net deferred tax assets will remain fully reserved until the related tax benefits are realized through the generation of taxable income in a particular year  or until we can demonstrate a history of generating taxable income 
in either case  the related tax benefits will not be recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations until the portion of deferred tax assets that resulted in an increase to goodwill is fully realized 
goodwill and identified intangible assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets are recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets 
as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price paid in acquisitions has been allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill 
identified intangible assets are amortized to expense over their expected useful lives and goodwill is not amortized 
once established  these assets are subject to periodic impairment assessments to determine if their current carrying values are recoverable based on information available at the time these assessments are made 
significant assumptions and estimates are required in making these assessments 
accordingly  the assumptions and estimates we use in implementing this policy affect the amount of identified intangible asset amortization and impairment charges  if any  reflected in our operating results 
as discussed below  our impairment assessments at october  resulted in impairment charges on identified intangible technology  trademark and customer assets acquired in previous acquisitions 
there was no impairment charge on identified intangible assets in 
table of contents general factors affecting our financial results there are a number of general factors that affect our results from period to period 
these factors are discussed below 
revenue 
we are transitioning our business model from one that emphasized the sale of one time perpetual licenses to our software  for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon delivery  to one that emphasizes the sale of subscription based products  for which revenue is recognized over the subscription period 
as a result  this transition will affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period until it is complete 
the transition became most evident in when we introduced many of our new subscription based products 
as subscription revenues grow as a percentage of total revenues  we expect our period to period revenues to become more comparable and predictable 
until our transition to subscription based products is closer to completion  a consequential portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from perpetual licenses to our software products 
these revenues are reported as license fees in our consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the quantity and size of individual license fee transactions can have a significant impact on revenues in a period 
our business is also seasonal  with the largest portion of our license fees typically coming in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  and professional service fees being the greatest during periods in which schools are in session 
while this seasonality does not generally impact the comparability of our annual results  it can significantly impact our results from quarter to quarter 
gross profit 
our gross profit during a period is dependent on a number of factors 
license fee revenues historically have had high gross profit due to the low direct cost of delivering these products 
as a result  the mix of license fee revenues to total revenues in a given period significantly influences reported total gross profit 
in addition  a large portion of our costs of revenue are fixed in nature 
these costs include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support our hosted subscription services  customer support operations  and full time professional services personnel who deliver our training services 
accordingly  increases in revenues allow us to leverage these costs resulting in higher gross profit  while decreases in revenues have the opposite effect 
operating expenses 
incentive compensation is a significant variable component of our sales and marketing expenses  approximating to of total revenues in any given period 
sales and marketing expenses also include costs such as travel  tradeshows  and conferences that can vary with revenue activity or individual events that occur during the period 
general and administrative expenses are substantially fixed in nature 
however  certain components such as our provision for bad debts  professional fees  and other expenses can vary based on business results  individual events  or initiatives we may be pursuing at various times throughout the year 
product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations does not reflect our total level of spending in these areas 
costs to enhance or maintain existing products  or to develop products prior to achieving technological feasibility  are charged to product maintenance and development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop new products after technological feasibility is achieved  which represent the majority of our total development spending  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenues 
accordingly  product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations can fluctuate 
table of contents from period to period  in terms of both total dollars and as a percentage of revenue  based on the nature and timing of activities occurring during the period 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of certain identified intangible assets acquired through various acquisitions 
while these expenses are generally predictable from period to period because they are fixed over the course of their individual useful lives  they can be affected by events and other factors that result in impairment of these assets and a corresponding reduction in future amortization 
overview of financial results the transition of our company that began in continued throughout and most of compared to  our revenues declined  to million  and our net loss decreased to million  or per share  from million  or per share 
the transition began in when we took a number of significant actions to change the strategic direction of the company 
these actions included significant leadership changes across the organization  the development of a new strategic product roadmap consisting of products that are offered only on a subscription basis  the restructuring of our sales and development organizations to align them with our new business direction  and  the development of the internal systems  processes  and disciplines necessary to support and sustain long term growth 
in executing these actions  we incurred in non cash technology impairment charges of million  cash and non cash restructuring and other charges of million  and reduced our operating expenses from in  we incurred million in non cash impairment charges related to previously acquired intangible assets  million in cash restructuring charges  and we further reduced operating expenses from in  we incurred modest cash restructuring charges of million and again reduced our operating expenses from the previous year 
by of the end of  we believe the most difficult transition activities are substantially complete 
in  we completed the conversion of our product library to our online instructional management system  the plato learning environment ple  and now offer award winning ple based products in our three key target markets of k remedial instruction  supplemental classroom instruction and post secondary developmental education 
in the middle of  we made changes in our sales leadership which has resulted in improved sales execution  and we finished the year with our first quarter of total order growth since the third quarter of finally  in late  we began the release of products unique in our industry that integrate assessment capabilities with our content to deliver standards based instruction personalized to each student based on his or her subject area mastery prior to and during the instruction 
while significant progress was made in  and we ended the year with modest year over year fourth quarter order growth  we did not achieve total order growth for the year 
total orders declined  from million in  to million in this decline  along with the transition from perpetual licensed products for which revenue is recognized up front on delivery to subscription license products for which revenue is recognized over the subscription period has had unfavorable effects on our revenues and operating results 
total revenues declined million from to as license fee revenues from perpetual products declined from 
table of contents million to million 
subscription revenues increased  or million  but the increase was only sufficient to offset the decline in services revenues that resulted from lower overall order volumes 
in response to the lower order and revenue levels  we continued to manage our cost structure in total operating expenses declined million  of which million relates to a decline in restructuring and impairment charges as most of these activities resulting in these types of charges are now behind us 
the balance of the decline represents a decrease from  and was spread across all functional areas of the company  with sales and marketing expenses making up the majority of the decline  decreasing from million in to million in as a result of our cost management activities we have reduced our revenue breakeven point going into fiscal to less than million 
we will continue in to execute the strategy we began late in  developing market leading new products that will be offered online  over the internet on a subscription basis 
we will continue to develop our sales organization and look forward to building off the momentum achieved in the fourth quarter of the financial effects of the transition to subscription products  however  are likely to continue to negatively affect the comparability of our year over year financial results in the near term 
this and other risks we face in our business are discussed in more detail in item a of part i of this report 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section above captioned general factors affecting our financial results 
revenues the following tables summarize certain key information to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of revenues 
table of contents sales order information in thousands change from change from amount amount order value subscriptions courseware assessment and other total subscriptions license fees services percent of total order value subscriptions courseware assessment and other total subscriptions license fees services certain amounts previously reported as assessment orders have been reclassified to courseware orders to conform to the current period presentation 

table of contents sales orders greater than  change from change from amount amount number value average value revenue by category in thousands change from change from amount amount subscriptions license fees services vs 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in  reflecting the decline in total orders as further discussed below  particularly the million decline in perpetual license fee orders  and the higher mix of subscription orders 
subscription revenues increased compared to and have surpassed license revenue as a percent of total revenue 
services revenues declined from on a decline in orders for professional services and for technical services  which are tied closely to perpetual license orders 
the decline in total orders from million in to million in reflects several factors changes in the way we license our products 
in  we continued the transition of our products from those that are licensed on a perpetual basis  which have higher one time selling prices  to those that are licensed on a subscription basis  which have lower selling prices but are renewable at the end of each subscription period 
this transition is reflected in the decline in perpetual license orders from to  and the increase in subscription courseware orders over the same period 
although the number of orders over  declined during  the average value of these orders increased  reflecting an increase in the number of multi year arrangements and a greater emphasis on selling to larger school districts 
the decline in orders for assessment and other subscription products reflects the maturity of these products 
starting in late we began the release of assessment products on ple that improve 
table of contents upon these legacy assessment products and are expected to drive additional demand for courseware products by virtue of the ability of these assessment products to prescribe content personalized to each student 
the timing and availability of new products 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached a key milestone with the conversion of the majority of our entire product library to our online instructional management system 
while we ended the year with our product suite converted to our new platform  the first three quarters of were impacted by customers delaying their purchasing decisions until our product conversion was completed 
the productivity of our sales and service organizations 
in  we made significant changes to our sales and service organizations through consolidation of these teams under one leader  who joined the company at the end of our second quarter 
in addition  we placed greater emphasis in our sales efforts on expanding beyond our traditional customer base to larger school districts  which requires the development of new customer relationships  and expanded the applications of our products which required new selling techniques and training for our sales force 
these changes in personnel  target customers and product emphasis negatively affected sales productivity during the year 
vs 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in  reflecting a decline in total orders as further discussed below  particularly the million decline in perpetual license fee orders  and the higher mix of subscription orders 
subscription revenues increased only slightly in compared to due to the timing of the release of new subscription products later in services revenues declined from on a decline in orders for professional services and for technical services  which are tied closely to perpetual license orders  partially offset by an increase in software support services which benefited from improved pricing discipline and an emphasis on obtaining renewals from existing perpetual license customers 
the decline in total orders from million in to million in primarily reflects the same types of factors that contributed to the decline in total orders from to as discussed above 
because was the first year in which we launched our new subscription products on ple  these products were more limited in scope and functionality or were not well timed with the customer buying season 
in addition  these new products required new product and sales training by the sales force  a large number of which were new to the company following sales organization changes in late these early product and sales transition factors were the primary factors leading to the decline in total orders from to gross profit to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of gross profit  the following tables summarize the percentage of total revenue  and the gross profit percentage for each revenue category 
table of contents percentage of total revenue revenue category subscriptions license fees services total gross profit percentage increase decrease revenue category to to subscriptions license fees services total total gross profit percentage reflects asset impairment charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively that are not included in the revenue category gross profit percentages in this table 
vs 
the total gross profit percentage decreased to in from in  primarily due to the decline in higher margin license fee revenue 
higher margin license fee revenues decreased from to of total revenue  while lower margin subscription revenues increased from to of total revenues 
these changes in revenue mix were due to the factors discussed under revenues above 
the changes from to in the gross profit percentages of each revenue category were as follows the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs including product development and intangibles amortization and distribution 
the decrease in the subscription gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to an increase in product development amortization on new subscription products released in and combined with the reallocation of 
table of contents customer support resources from legacy to new subscription products in response to the growth in subscription customers  partially offset by the increase in subscription revenue 
the increase in the services gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to improvements in the productivity and utilization of resources in our services organization and to an increase in the mix of higher margin software support services revenues which have low variable costs 
vs 
the total gross profit percentage increased to in from in  primarily due to a reduction in asset impairment charges on capitalized product development costs and purchased technology assets from million in  to million in the impairment charges were triggered by changes in product development strategies formalized in the fourth quarter of as part of our strategic planning process 
these changes  as well as our financial performance  resulted in a reduction in anticipated future cash flows from products in development or purchased in previous acquisitions 
impairment charges related to products in development were million  and were primarily related to instructional management products which were expected to be phased out or discontinued when a replacement product was released in impairment charges related to purchased technology assets were million  and were primarily related to products which were expected to be replaced sooner than originally anticipated  which together with our financial performance  resulted in a decrease in the anticipated future cash flows from these products relative to the cash flows expected at the time these assets were purchased 
the impairment charge of million related to technology assets purchased in a previous acquisition 
as a result of our financial performance  our estimate of future cash flows attributable to these assets was reduced resulting in the impairment charge 
the changes from to in the gross profit percentages of each revenue category were as follows the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs including product development and intangibles amortization and distribution 
the increase in the subscription gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to a reduction in royalty fees due to a non recurring charge in and the renegotiation of an agreement which resulted in lower royalty fees in also contributing to the increase were higher subscription revenues on a base of primarily fixed costs which include amortization of product development and purchased technology  and depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support our hosted subscription services 
the increase in the services gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to improvements in the productivity and utilization of resources in our 
table of contents services organization and to an increase in the mix of higher margin software support services revenues which have low variable costs 
operating expenses to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of our operating expenses  the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue and percentage change in the amounts from the previous year for certain operating expense line items to to sales and marketing general and administrative product maintenance and development amortization of intangibles subtotal restructuring  impairment and other charges n a total operating expenses vs 
total operating expenses declined million  from million in to million in of the total decline  million was related to a reduction in restructuring  impairment and other charges as substantially all of the activities that generally result in these types of charges were completed in see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of these charges 
sales and marketing expenses declined to million in as compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects changes made early in to reduce the level of field sales resources  concentrate the remaining resources in the territories with the largest market potential  and better leverage of our inside sales organization 
also contributing to the decline was a decrease in commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in due primarily to reductions in labor costs  external audit fees  and legal expenses 

table of contents product maintenance and development expenses for were million compared to million reported for the reduction in product maintenance and development expenses reflects lower maintenance costs on legacy products and lower start up costs on new product investments 
total product development spending  which represents the combination of spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization of million in represented a decrease of from as certain assets acquired in earlier acquisitions were either impaired during or became fully amortized during vs 
total operating expenses were million in  compared to million in these amounts include restructuring  impairment and other charges of million in and million in the charges in reflect million in non cash impairment charges on customer and trademark intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions  and million in cash and non cash charges related to restructuring activities in the us and us charges are substantially all related to restructuring activities in the us and  to a lesser degree  the uk see note to consolidated financial statements for a further detailed description of these charges 
sales and marketing expenses were million in as compared to million in these decreases primarily reflect the effect of the sales organization changes we initiated in that resulted in voluntary and involuntary sales force attrition that reduced salaries  travel  professional services  facilities and other related costs 
also contributing to the decline was the realignment of our service resources from sales support to billable activities which shifted costs of approximately million from selling expense to cost of revenues  and decreased commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in due primarily to a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the reduction in bad debt expense reflects sustained improvements in the quality of our accounts receivable attributable to tighter credit and other policies we implemented in other cost reductions in general and administrative expenses were largely offset by stock based compensation expense following the implementation in of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment 
these expenses totaled million  of which million were recorded in general and administrative expense 
product maintenance and development expenses for were million  comparable to the million reported for total product development spending  which represents the combination of spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  we began the implementation of our new product strategy which accounts for the significant increase in total spending and the emphasis on new product development activities  which are generally capitalized 

table of contents amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization of million in represented a decrease of from as certain assets acquired in earlier acquisitions became fully amortized during restructuring  impairment and other charges included in operating expenses in were million compared to million in the expense includes the following a non cash impairment charge of million related to customer and trademark intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions 
this impairment charge was triggered by our actual financial performance and corresponding reductions in anticipated future revenues attributable to those assets 
these reductions related primarily to declines we experienced in the sale of certain perpetual license or maturing products that are sold to these customers  or that contain these trademarks 
cash restructuring charges of million related to uk facilities actions taken in these charges  which represent estimates of our remaining lease obligations on these facilities  include initial estimates of charges for a facility that was not formally vacated until and updated estimates for facilities vacated in cash restructuring charges of million for severance and other costs related to actual and anticipated us workforce reductions as we continue to align our cost structure with actual and expected revenue levels 
interest income interest income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflected a decline in our average cash and cash equivalents balances  partially offset by higher interest rates earned on these investments 
interest income increased from million in to million in an increase in interest rates earned on investments in more than offset the decrease in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances over the prior year 
income taxes as discussed earlier under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates  our net deferred tax assets  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill  are fully reserved 
accordingly  we do not record a tax benefit related to our operating losses 
however  because certain tax deductible goodwill can not be used to offset our other net deferred tax assets we are required to record income tax expense related to this liability 
the amount of tax deductible goodwill expense was million in each of the years  and in addition  tax expense included million of state income tax expense related to states in which we do not file a consolidated income tax return 
liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents totaling million and net accounts receivable of million 
on june   we entered into a three year senior secured credit facility which provides us with a revolving line of credit up to the lesser of million or one times the company s trailing twelve months subscription and maintenance revenue 
under the agreement  we have the option of selecting an interest rate for any drawdown under the facility equal to the applicable prime or libor rate plus 
table of contents a sliding margin that is based on the amount of borrowings outstanding 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by all of the assets of the company 
financial covenants are limited to minimum quarterly thresholds of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda that are tested only when the unused portion of the line of credit plus our cash and cash equivalents on hand is less than million 
we capitalized legal and banking fees of  associated with this credit facility 
these costs are being amortized over the three year term of the agreement 
there were no drawdowns on this facility in net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended october  and million during the same period a year ago 
the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by our net loss  changes in working capital accounts  particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments  and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and the expense associated with stock based awards 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ending october  and million during the same period a year ago 
the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended october  primarily related to the investment in internal and purchased software development associated with the addition of new features and functionality to our online instructional management system  ple  and the conversion of existing products and development of new products to operate in the ple environment 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million during the year ended october  and million during the same period a year ago 
during the year ended october   the payment of million in debt financing fees associated with our line of credit and payments on capital lease obligations were partially offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of company stock to employees 
our principal commitments consist of future minimum payments due under operating leases and royalty and software license agreements 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving loan agreement as discussed above would require future use of cash 
at october   the future minimum payments under these commitments were as follows payments due by period in thousands year to to more than contractual obligations total or less years years years operating leases royalty agreements capital leases obligations total a number of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew 
our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these options 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed 
table of contents minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  anticipated cash provided by operating activities  and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of product development expenditures  order volume  and the timing and collection of receivables 
disclosures about off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  interest rate risk on june   we entered into a three year senior secured credit facility which provides us with a revolving line of credit up to the lesser of million or one times the company s trailing twelve months subscription and maintenance revenue 
under the agreement we have the option of selecting an interest rate for any drawdown under the facility equal to the applicable prime or libor rate plus a sliding margin that is based on the amount of borrowings outstanding 
there were no borrowings outstanding at october  foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign operations are not a significant component of our business  and as a result  risks relating to foreign currency fluctuation are considered minimal
