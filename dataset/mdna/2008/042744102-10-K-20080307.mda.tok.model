there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
any downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition at the same time that other areas of our operations  including new loan originations and assets under administration in our trust department may also be experiencing negative pressures from the same underlying negative economic conditions 
liabilities for retirement plans we have a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of investment return 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy  our own operations or applicable law and regulation may result in material changes to our liability for postretirement expense  with consequent impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires a reduction in the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is  in part  based on an estimate of future taxable income 
goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
other than temporary decline in the value of debt and equity securities sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that  for individual securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  an enterprise shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
for example  if it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down shall be included in current period ear nings 
a significant economic downturn might result in an other than temporary impairment in securities held in our portfolio 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and our financial condition as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
when necessary  prior year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income of million for  an increase of thousand  or  compared to diluted earnings per share of represented an increase of  or  from during  our net interest margin stabilized and net interest income increased from this followed two successive years of decreasing net interest income and three consecutive years of decreasing net interest margins 
out net interest margin was essentially the same as in  and our increase in net interest income from to was attributable to a increase in average earning assets 
we recorded a non cash pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of of thousand related to our proportionate share  as a member bank of the visa credit card organization  of certain estimated litigation costs incurred by visa usa  inc in the quarter 
like other financial institutions that are visa members  we are obligated to indemnify visa in connection with certain legal proceedings 
while the outcome and amount of potential losses that may be incurred by visa  and ultimately by its member banks  related to litigation involving visa and certain of its member banks is inherently uncertain  based on the settlement of the litigation with american express and our estimate of the fair value of potential losses related to the remaining litigation  we recognized an after tax charge to fourth quarter earnings of thousand representing a cents dilution of earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the year ended december  however  in october  visa  in connection with a restructuring  issued shares of its common stock to its member banks in contemplation of an initial public offering ipo of these and other shares which visa has indicated is planned for the first half of visa has indicated that it intends that payments related to its antitrust litigation matters will be funded from an escrow account to be established with a portion of the proceeds from its ipo  including proceeds allocable to member banks shares 
we currently expect that our proportional share of the proceeds of visa s planned ipo in will exceed the aggregate amount of this charge  and if so  that the income to us in will exceed the charge 
on february   visa  inc filed an amended form s registration statement for its class a common stock public offering with a price range of to per share  but visa has not yet set a date f or the ipo 
at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on shareholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from year end our total shareholders equity at year end increased over the year end level 
major changes to shareholders equity included i million of net income for the year ii a million net unrealized gain in the valuation allowance for available for sale securities  offset by iii cash dividends of million  and iv repurchases of our own common stock of million 
as of the last trading day of  the average of our closing bid and asked stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to tangible book value 
the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

through year end  we had experienced an improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  assets continued to demonstrate considerable strength  both as compared to our peer banks and to our historically sound asset quality levels 
nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   a decrease of thousand from the prior year end 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans was 
at december   a decrease from 
one year earlier 
loans charged off net of recoveries against the allowance for loan losses were thousand for  as compared to thousand for the prior year 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans  down three basis points from at the prior year end 
b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
as described in the section entitled use of non gaap financial measures on page of the report we calculate net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
change in net interest income dollars in thousands tax equivalent basis years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount interest and dividend income interest expense net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  an increase of thousand  or  from million in this compared to a decrease of million  or  between and factors contributing to the decrease in net interest income over the three year period are discussed in the following portions of this section bi in the following table  net interest income components are presented on a tax equivalent basis 
changes between periods are attributed to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

we experienced a decrease in net interest income of million from to although we experienced an increase in average net earning assets ie  changes in volume  which had an thousand positive impact on net interest income  this was more than offset by the negative effect of a decrease in our net interest spread and net interest margin ie changes in rates  which had a negative impact of million on net interest income 
generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes  and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
impact of interest rate changes in mid  due to actions by the federal reserve fed the federal funds target rate decreased to an almost unprecedented low of 
in mid  the federal reserve board reversed course and began to increase short term rates with a series of basis point increases in the targeted federal funds rate  reaching by mid from mid to fall  the fed did not take any actions to change short term rates 
in september  however  in response to perceptions of a weakening economy and a loss of liquidity in the short term credit market  precipitated in large part by problems related to subprime residential real estate lending  the fed began lowering the federal funds target rate 
by the december meeting of the board of governors  the rate had decreased basis points  to  and in early  the fed  in response to continuing liquidity concerns in the credit markets  lowered the federal funds rate by an additional basis points  to 
we expect to see an immediate impact in the cost of our deposits  which will be followed by a gradual reduction as maturing time deposits reprice 
we also expect that our loan yields will decline  but that decrease may not be as severe if mid to long term rates do not fall as quickly or to the extent of short term rates 
our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the following analysis of the relationship between prevailing rates and changes in rates and our net interest margin and net interest income covers the period from to the present 
an important recent development with regard to the effect of rate changes in our profitability has been the so called flattening of the yield curve 
after the fed began increasing short term interest rates in june  the yield curve did not maintain its traditional upward curve but flattened  that is  as short term rates increased  longer term rates stayed unchanged or decreased 
therefore  the traditional spread between short term rates and long term rates the upward yield curve essentially disappeared  ie  the curve had flattened 
late in and in early  the yield curve was occasionally inverted  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
this flattening of the yield curve was the most significant factor in reducing our net interest income in and only at the end of the second quarter of did the yield on longer term s ecurities begin to increase over short term investments 
this was further enhanced when long term rates held steady after the fed lowered short term rates in september nevertheless  longer term rates were resistant to increases during the period of rising short term rates  both due to borrower expectations and to a widespread perception in the credit markets of limited risk of default 
to the extent these perceptions and expectations are now changing  long term rates may be expected to remain steady  or perhaps even rise  even though short term rates have now begun to drop sharply 
thus  the yield curve may be expected to return to a more traditional shape with consequent benefit to company margins 
no assurances can be given on this recent development  however  particularly as aggregate levels of borrowing  especially consumer mortgage related borrowings may be expected to diminish 
in addition to the shape of the yield curve  our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
generally  there has been a negative correlation between changes in prevailing interest rates and our net interest margin  especially when rates begin to move in a different direction 
when prevailing rates begin to decline  our net interest margin generally increases in immediately ensuing periods  and vice versa  as in each case earning assets reprice more slowly than interest bearing sources of funds 
this was the case for our net interest margin during the to mid period  when prevailing market rates were declining and our margin increased  and during the mid to period  when the rate decline began to decelerate and rates then reversed and began to increase and our margins experienced a negative effe ct 
in and  however  as the fed s push to increase prevailing rates matured  our net interest margin continued to suffer as a result of the flattening yield curve 
this historical trend too  however  may be expected to benefit our net interest margins in upcoming periods  as deposit rates begin to decline 
the net interest margin for the full year of was 
in ensuing years  our margin steadily decreased  during an extended period of increasing short term interest rates 
our margin reached a low point in the fourth quarter of  at 
the margin for the first two and last quarter of was 
margin decreased to for the third quarter of primarily due to an increase in seasonal higher costing municipal deposits 
in general  the recovery from the fourth quarter of was due to the fact that a portion of our earning assets repriced upwards at a rate faster than the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for the year  net interest margin was  down one basis point from the impact of this decrease was thousand on net interest income for the year overall  we expect that the dramatic reduction in short term interest rates since september will have a significant impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in future periods 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income 
this positive effect was partially offset by the thousand negative effect on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  a decrease of million  or  in investment securities and an increase of million in the average balance of federal funds 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during  although the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio decreased slightly 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i commercial and commercial real estate loans an increase of million  or  ii residential real estate loans an increase of million  or and iii other consumer loans an increase of million  or 
although average loans increased by in  this was a lower rate of increase than the rate experienced in the million increase in average paying liabilities resulted from a million increase in time deposits and a million increase in non maturity deposit balances 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of million in the average balance of other borrowed funds 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
to for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a thousand increase in net interest income 
however  this positive effect was more than offset by the million negative effect on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  especially the decrease in the net interest margin  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  an increase of million  or  in investment securities and an increase of million in the average balance of federal funds 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during  although the average balance of indirect loans was modest 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i commercial and commercial real estate loans an increase of million  or  ii residential real estate loans an increase of million  or and iii other consumer loans an increase of million  or 
although average loans increased by in this was a lower rate of increase than the rate experienced in the only category of loans that grew faster i n than in was commercial loans  which grew at an rate in versus in the million increase in average paying liabilities between and resulted from an million increase in time deposits  offset  in part  by a million decrease in non maturity deposit balances 
the average balance of other borrowed funds was virtually unchanged 
the change in the mix of deposit categories from non maturity to time deposits is typical during a period of rising rates 
the million of deposits acquired in the april branch acquisition accounted for a portion of the increase in average deposit balances between and  since these deposits were not included in the average balances for the first three months of the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
in addition to the following discussion  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance is maintained that reflects our best estimate of probable incurred loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as the remaining portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
we use a two step process to determine the provision for loans losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
we evaluate impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  under sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan 
we evaluate the remainder of the portfolio under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
at december  we had one loan considered impaired and evaluated under sfas no 
that loan had sufficient collateral and required no specific reserve 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
homogenous loan pools under our sfas no 
analysis  we group homogeneous loans as follows  each with its own estimated loss rate i other commercial and commercial real estate loans  ii one to four family residential real estate loans  iii home equity loans  iv indirect loans low risk tiers based on credit scores  v indirect loans high risk tiers  and vi other consumer loans 
within the group of other commercial and commercial real estate loans  we sub group loans based on our internal system of risk rating  which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans 
we establish loss rates for each of these pools 
furthermore  larger balance loans within the higher risk ratings are pulled out of their homogenous pools and are evaluated individually 
estimated losses  under our sfas no 
evaluation  reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of december  in our evaluation  we do both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the homogeneous pools 
quantitative analysis quantitatively  we determined the historical loss rate for each homogeneous loan pool 
during the past five years we have had little charge off activity on loans secured by residential real estate 
indirect consumer lending represents a significant component of our total loan portfolio and is the only category of loans that has a history of losses that lends itself to a trend analysis 
we have had two losses on commercial real estate loans in the past five years 
losses on commercial loans other than those secured by real estate are also historically low  but can vary widely from year to year  this is the most complex category of loans in our loss analysis 
our net charge offs for the past five years have been at historical lows for our company 
annualized net charge offs have ranged from 
to 
of average loans during this period 
in prior years this ratio was significantly higher 
for example  in the mid to late s  the charge off ratio ranged from 
to 
for our company 
the ratio for bank holding companies in our peer group was 
at december   the most recent reporting period 
the peer group ratio was also very low  ranging from 
to 
in the five preceding years 
qualitative analysis while historical loss experience provides a reasonable starting point for our analysis  historical losses  or even recent trends in losses  do not by themselves form a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level for the allowance 
therefore  we also considered and adjusted historical loss factors for qualitative and environmental factors that are likely to cause credit losses associated with our existing portfolio 
these included changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and adversely classified loans changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses changes in the quality of the loan review system changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio or pool for each homogeneous loan pool  we estimate a loss factor expressed in basis points for each of the qualitative factors above  and for historical credit losses 
we update and change  if necessary  the loss rates assigned to various pools based on the analysis of loss trends and the change in qualitative and environmental factors 
in order to more accurately estimate probable loan losses  during we segmented the loan loss reserve pools for our commercial loan portfolio between commercial loans and commercial loans secured by real estate  and updated our loss rates primarily related to criticized commercial loans and indirect consumer loans accounted for under sfas no 
these enhancements did not result in a material change to the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  or in the allowance for loan losses 
from june to june  the federal reserve bank increased prevailing short term rates in an effort to slow down national economic growth and check potential increases in the inflation rate 
in the last part of  the federal reserve bank began to cut rates in response to the growing liquidity crisis in credit markets and evident slowing of the economy wide growth 
in our market area  however  there was very little impact  by year end  from these developments in credit markets and the national economy on unemployment rates  job growth and business failures 
during the june to june period  when short term rates rose dramatically  long term rates held steady or even fell 
except for indirect consumer loans  interest rates for most of our borrowers are based on intermediate and long term rates  especially for residential real estate loans and for commercial loans 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing economic conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains an unallocated portion within the allowance for loan losses reflecting the uncertainty of future economic conditions within our market area 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was thousand at december   a decrease of thousand  or  compared to the million at december  this reduction was primarily due to the improvement in loan quality ratios at december  summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses dollars in thousands loans  net of unearned income years ended december  loans at end of period average loans total assets at end of period nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans commercial real estate commercial loans residential real estate loans consumer loans total nonaccrual loans loans past due or more days and still accruing interest total nonperforming loans repossessed assets other real estate owned total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of period loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential installment loans to individuals total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential installment loans to individuals total recoveries of loans previously charged off net loans charged off provision for loan losses charged to expense balance at end of period nonperforming asset ratio analysis net loans charged off as a percentage of average loans provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans  period end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans  period end nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets  period end allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential mortgage indirect and other installment loans to individuals unallocated total iii

noninterest expense noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of noninterest expense are presented in the following table

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired and are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect and other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net no subprime mortgage activities during the second half of  the us experienced significant disruption and volatility in its financial and capital markets 
a major cause of the disruption was a collapse of residential real estate values across much of the us  which in turn triggered widespread defaults on subprime mortgage loans and steep devaluations of portfolios containing these loans and securities collateralized by them 
many lending institutions suffered sizable charge offs and losses in the second half of we did not 
we have never engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we have never acquired any subprime mortgage loans 
on occasion we may have made a loan to a borrower having a fico score of or below or have had extensions of credit outstanding to borrowers who have developed credit problems after origination resulting in deterioration of their fico scores 
we also on occasion have extended community development loans to borrowers whose creditworthiness is below our normal standards as part of the community support program we have developed in fulfillment of our statutorily mandated duty to support low and moderate income neighborhoods within our service area 
however  we are a prime lender and apply prime lending standards 
residential real estate loans in recent years  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
residential mortgage demand has been moderate since  after a period in the preceding years when demand was high 
however  during and and the first quarter of  we sold many of our year  fixed rate mortgage originations  while retaining the servicing 
by the end of the first quarter of  as yields on longer term residential real estate loans began to rise  we stopped selling our year mortgage originations and decided to retain them in our portfolio 
during  the million of new residential real estate loan originations more than offset normal principal amortization on the pre existing loans in the segment 
we expect that  if we continue to retain all or most originations  we will be able to maintain the current level of residential real estate loans and may experience some continued growth 
however  if the demand for residential real estate loans in our service area decreases  due to mortgage rate increases or a softening of the local real estate market or the economy generally  our portfolio also may decrease  which may negatively impact our financial performance  and if the economy or local real estate market suffers a major downturn  the quality of our residential loan portfolio and our financial condition itself may be damaged 
indirect loans for several years prior to  indirect consumer loans consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper was the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
for much of this period  indirect consumer loans were the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
in the ensuing five years  this segment of the portfolio fluctuated in size  with periods of expansion followed by contraction 
generally  over the period the segment experienced little growth in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this change in indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing by auto manufacturers  commencing late and recurring period ically in the years since then 
during the fourth quarter of and for the first two quarters of  the indirect portfolio experienced a small amount of growth  but the level flattened in the third quarter of and declined during the fourth quarter of and the first half of before rising slightly during the second half of at the end of the first quarter of  we experienced an increase in indirect loans  which continued throughout the second and third quarters of  for a variety of factors  including the decision by the automobile manufacturers to be less aggressive with their subsidized financing programs 
in the fourth quarter of  however  indirect loan balances declined by  measured at quarter end although the average balance for the fourth quarter was slightly higher than the average balance for the third quarter 
during the first three quarters of  we elected not to compete aggressively in the indirect loan sector  in the face of a resurgence of extremely low rates being offered by automobile manufacturers 
as a result  principal amortization and prepayments exceeded our originations and indirect balances decreased 
in the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of  however  we saw our indirect loan balances increase 
even though indirect balances fell during the fourth quarter of  our indirect loan total at december  was million above the prior year end total 
at december   indirect loans continued to represent the second largest category of loans in our portfolio and a significant component of our business 
however  if auto manufacturers and their finance affiliates persist in marketing heavily subsidized financing programs  our indirect loan portfolio is likely to continue to experience rate pressure and limited  if any  overall growth as a percentage of the total portfolio 
moreover  as noted above for residential real estate loans  if the national or regional economy weakens in upcoming periods  we may experience a weakened demand for indirect loans and possibly a weakened quality within the portfolio  which could negatively impact our financial performance 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans we have experienced strong to moderate demand for commercial loans for the past several years  and thus commercial and commercial real estate loan balances have grown significantly  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
this pattern continued during as these loan balances grew million  or  from december  substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlb or us treasury indices 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category

however  these same loan balances are reported as real estate residential in the table of period end balances on the previous page  captioned types of loans 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets has been impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed on in this report on page under the heading impact of interest rate changes we expect that such will continue to be the case  that is  that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will continue to be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the makeup of the loan portfolio  the shape of the yield curve  consumer expectations and preferences and the rate at which the portfolio expands 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during a period of change in prevailing rates  we generally experience a time lag between the impact of the change on our deposit portfolio which is felt relatively quickly and the impact of the change on our loan portfolio which occurs more slowly 
the consequence of this time lag is a positive impact on the net interest margin during the beginning of the rate decline period  and a negative impact on the margin at the beginning of a rate increase period 
as we discussed in the prior review of net interest income  during the period from mid to mid  the federal reserve bank increase the targeted federal funds rate from to  in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures and unrestrained borrowing 
during this period of rate increase  the time lag between repricing of our deposits and the repricing of loan balances was especially lengthy  in some sectors of the portfolio  the repricing upward of loan rates was not completed before the fed began decreasing rates in the last four months of thus  for our company as for any commercial banks  the return to a decreasing interest rate environment  while it may relieve some of the recent extreme pressures on our net interest margins  may not have quite the positive impact on margins and net interest income that would normally be experienced in periods where spreads are typica lly wider before the rate decline commences 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
most of the real estate construction loans are made with a commitment for permanent financing  whether extended by us or unrelated third parties 
the maturity distribution below reflects the final maturity of the permanent financing 
b 
maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not funded at that time 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximatel y million 
c 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  million of residential real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
during  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no

potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december  we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
at december  we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment his tory  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for the loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state

average deposit balances years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance rate average balance rate average balance rate demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the increase was primarily generated from our pre existing branch network  although we did open two new branches in  a new branch in plattsburgh in the beginning of and another in the saratoga springs area in april of during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for early in april we acquired approximately million of deposit balances in our acquisition of three branches from hsbc 
the inclusion of these acquired deposits in our average deposit balances for only part of the year  versus the entire year  accounted for approximately million of the increase in average balances 
the remaining increase was generated from our pre existing branch network  and we opened a new branch in the saratoga springs area in january of during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the acquisition of balances in the hsbc branch purchase transaction accounted for approximately million of the increase in average balances between the years 
the remaining increase was generated from our pre existing branch network 
we did not sell or close any branches during the covered period  the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits fluctuations in balances of our now accounts and time deposits of  or more are largely the result of municipal deposit fluctuations 
municipal deposits on average represent to of our total deposits 
municipal deposits are typically placed in now accounts and time deposits of short duration 
many of our municipal deposit relationships are subject to annual renewal  by formal or informal agreements 
in general  there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits starting with a low point during july and august 
account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into the winter months from tax deposits and receive an additional boost at the end of march from the electronic deposit of state funds 
in addition to these seasonal fluctuations within types of accounts  the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year to year as some municipalities move their accounts in and out of our banks due to competitive factors 
often  the balances of municipal deposits at the end of a quarter are not representative of the average balances for that quarter 
overall our deposit balances generally followed a pattern of flat to slightly decreased levels in the first calendar quarter  increasing totals in the second and third quarters  and continued increases in the fourth quarter  but moderating slightly at year end 
our deposit experience in followed this pattern 
in the first quarter  the average balance decreased million  or  from the fourth quarter of  but rebounded in the second quarter with a million  or  increase in average balances over the first quarter of average deposit balances for the third quarter of increased by million  or  over the second quarter of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in municipal balances  but non municipal balances also increased during the quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  the average balance increased as expected  by million  reflecting the significant increase in interest bearing demand deposits attributable to the seasonal increase in municipal deposits 
however  by the fourth quarter period end  municipal deposit balances were only million higher than the balance at september  during the uninterrupted period of declining interest rates from may through the first half of  we experienced a trend typical for financial institutions where maturing time deposits were transferred to non maturity interest bearing transaction accounts 
this period of declining rates ended in june as the fed initiated a series of seventeen basis point increases in prevailing rates extending through june as a result of this rising short term rate environment commencing in mid  we began to experience a reversal of the prior trend in deposit account migration as our customers  including municipal accounts  started to transfer some of their non maturity balances back into time deposits 
at december  time deposits represented of total deposits  up from at june  this ratio did not reach the high water mark for recent years of at june  as prevailing market rates began decreasing in the last four months of  we saw the beginnings of a migration out of time deposits and back to non maturity accounts 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve bank 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the federal reserve rate decreases in the through mid period  we experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits throughout the period 
the cost of deposits during the second quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
after the federal reserve bank began a protracted series of rate increases in june  our cost of deposits continued to fall in the third quarter of as maturing time deposits were still repricing at lower rates 
from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  however  our average cost of deposits increased each quarter 
this trend began to reverse itself in the past two quarters and we expect that our cost of deposits will continue to fall as long as the federal reserve bank continues a policy of further rate decreases to stimulate the economy in v

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of our balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end maturing loans in our portfolio also represent a steady source of balance sheet cash flow 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  we have supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million 
the average balance throughout was only thousand and there was no period end balance 
we have established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb  each of these lines provided for a maximum borrowing line of million at december  we borrowed only occasionally from the overnight line of credit with the fhlb during the average balance throughout was thousand and there was no period end balance 
if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage bac ked securities  loans and fhlb stock 
the balance in other short term borrowings at december  consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york 
in addition  we have identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding accessible in relatively short time periods 
also  glens falls national has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed securities  and from maturing loans in our portfolio  our stable core deposit bas e and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the most significant changes to shareholders equity include  net income of million and net unrealized gains in the valuation allowance for available for sale securities million  net of tax which were only partially offset by i cash dividends million  ii repurchases of our own common stock million and  iii our guarantee of a million loan to our employee stock ownership plan esop which requires a reduction in shareholders equity for the shares acquired with loan proceeds that have not yet been allocated to employees 
in each of and  we enhanced our regulatory capital by issuing million of capital securities in private placements with institutional investors  utilizing a subsidiary delaware business trust for that purpose 
these trust preferred securities were reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and these securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
under the federal reserve s regulatory capital guidelines discussed below  trust preferred securities may qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues or trust preferred securities qualify as tier regulatory capital 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to our holding company and subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital for the risk based capital guidelines  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
in addition to regulatory constrictions on payments of dividends  there are statutory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we may engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions may be used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions may be used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions may be used to manage customers requests for funding 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates interest rates or prices fees for products and services will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest reasonably predictable repricing dates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demons trated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions from september through january that resulted in a basis point decrease in prevailing rates 
we believe that decreases in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short term positive impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the mid to longer term 
we believe that increases in prevailing rates will generally have a negative impact on our margin and net interest income in the short term  which would be mitigaged or perhaps reversed over the long term 
in each case  that is  in the case of increasing or decreasing rates  the slope of the yield curve and chang es in the slope of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
