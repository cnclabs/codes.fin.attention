item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company as of december  and and for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s anticipated results or expectations  including its business plan and strategies are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of typically  forward looking statements are predictive and are not statements of historical fact  and the words anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  and similar expressions  as they relate to us  the bank  the trust company  or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable and have based these expectations on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have made  these expectations may prove to be incorrect 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include  without limitation  the following our dependence on key banking and management personnel  the risk of losses due to loan defaults by larger commercial loan customers or a significant number of smaller borrowers  our dependence on a favorable local economy in the bank s primary service area  the effect of banking regulation and the bank s confidence with such regulations on the bank s ability to grow and compete  the effect of changes in federal economic and monetary policies and local competition on the bank s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads  general changes in economic conditions  including interest rates and real estate values  and restrictions imposed on us by regulators or regulations of the banking industry 
please also refer to the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of some of the principal risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
executive overview net loss for was million compared to a net income of million in the loss was largely attributable to three factors first  the significant loan loss provisions taken during the year resulting primarily from write downs in the value of a group of pre loans centered in a residential development project in northeast indiana  second  certain other  but significantly smaller losses incurred in value of our loan portfolio as part of our ongoing assessment and measurement of those related loans and with our imposition of stricter lending standards and procedures  and third  certain expenses associated with the closure of our indianapolis and angola offices 
net interest income increased from to  although net interest margin decreased from to 
growth in average earning assets drove this increase in net interest income  which was partially offset by an increase in cost of funds and adverse affects of the increase in non performing assets 
non interest income increased by from to  which was driven by a  or increase in trust and brokerage fees 
the wealth management segment has continued to show strong revenue growth and asset growth for the th consecutive year 
service charges increased by and loan broker fees doubled from to operating expenses increased by million or from to the increase was due to additional staffing and overhead costs related to a full year of expenses for our a sixth bank branch in allen county opened in july of  the construction and opening of our warsaw branch  and expenses associated with the closure of our indianapolis and angola offices 
in addition  fdic insurance premiums increased over  due to a change in the assessment calculation used by the fdic  which affected all federally insured banks  and especially de novo banks such as ours  formed after total assets increased by million or from the prior year  and loan growth accounted for over million of that growth 
asset quality continues to be a major focus of the bank  in the wake of the substantial charge offs and the significant increase in non performing assets the bank sustained during  resulting in an aggregate of million of identified nonperforming assets plus delinquencies at december   or of total assets 
core deposits grew million and now comprise over of total deposits  compared to approximately in the prior year 
while our cost of funds did increase in  the core deposit growth helped limit this by providing lower cost alternatives to out of market funding and borrowings 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions 
absent the availability of some of these factors  we base our estimates upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary 
we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects a decrease of million from a net income of million in and a decrease of million from net income of million posted in net loss per diluted share of reflects a decrease from the reported in and a decrease from the posted in the net loss posted in was the result of a significant increase in the provision for loan losses  as well as increased non interest expenses associated with the closure of our indianapolis and angola offices 
revenue growth  including net interest and non interest income  of million  or  due to loan volume growth  was offset by an increase in operating expenses of million  or  as a result of the opening of the warsaw bank branch  costs associated with the closure of our indianapolis and angola branches  as well as a significant increase in fdic insurance premiums 
net interest income in was million compared to million in  an increase of million due mainly from an increase in loans outstanding 
noninterest income in was million compared to million in  an increase of  the increase was due primarily to a  or  increase in fees earned on trust and brokerage assets under management and a  or increase in deposit service charges 
net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  resulting in million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million and million  respectively  providing for net interest income of million 
the increase of million in net interest income in from and the increase over net interest income from were primarily attributable to an increase in the loans outstanding in both years  as well as an increase in lower cost core deposits in   and this increase was partially offset by an increase in average non performing loans during  which decreased our margin by approximately basis points for the year 
the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the decrease in net yield during was attributable to the flattening of yield on earning assets and an increase in cost of funds 
we continued to place more fixed rate loans in our portfolio in in order to neutralize our balance sheet 
however  the fixed rate loans were generally at a lower rate than the variable rate loans originated in our margin on average loans was also adversely affected by an increase in non performing loans 
deposit costs increased as a result of a shift of non interesting bearing accounts to money market accounts 
overall  rates on each account type increased as well due to competitive pressures in the market 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

average loans comprised  and of average earning assets during  and  respectively 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of  and earned  or of total interest income  an increase of million from the improvement in net interest income was mainly due to the increase in average loans 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned  or of total interest income while the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned  or of total interest income during the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets during with an average tax equivalent yield of  total securities contributed million  or of total interest income in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income  in during  the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets during with an average tax equivalent yield of  total securities contributed million  or of total interest income in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income  in during  the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets 
with an average yield of  securities contributed million  or of total interest income in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income in interest expense is primarily generated from money market deposits and certificates of deposit  which equaled and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during  and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during  and and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during total borrowings were of average earning assets during  and money market balances had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in  compared to an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in certificates of deposit had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in  compared to an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in interest expense on savings and interest bearing checking totaled of total interest expense during and of total interest expense during the company paid million of interest expense on borrowings  or of total interest expense  during and paid million of interest expense on borrowings  or of total interest expense  during during  money market accounts had an average rate of and cost million or of total interest expense  while certificates of deposit had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense 
savings deposits and interest bearing checking accounts totaled of average interest bearing liabilities during with an average rate of  or of total interest expense in total borrowings had an average rate of during provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for  million for and million for in this was driven by significant charge downs related to a group of pre residential real estate development loans made up of different parties within the same development 
the and provision was a result of some net charge off activity  as well as significant growth of the loan portfolio and the portfolio composition and risk 
the provision expense reflects an million increase from the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
a portion of the foregoing group of loans began to show signs of deterioration in the fourth quarter of  while the remaining portion demonstrated signs of weakening beginning in the first quarter of at that time  those loans were placed on the watch list and classified as special mention 
this caused an increase in our general reserves  as the balances within the special mention category increased significantly 
in the second quarter  the status of these loans remained unchanged 
the borrowers were able to make interest payments and keep loans current 
however  management was concerned with the lack of activity the particular development demonstrated and therefore increased the reserves on these loans again 
in the third quarter the loans showed further signs of weakening  some payments became delinquent and this caused management to order new appraisals on collateral securing the loans 
at that time  we determined that certain of these loans were indeed impaired and they were written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral securing them 
this resulted in a significant provision expense and charge down during the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter  we received the appraisal on the remaining tract of land and this resulted in an additional charge down and increase to the provision 
all loans related to these projects were also taken to non accrual status 
these steps taken by management have been reviewed by the federal reserve bank as part of their annual safety and soundness examination as well 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   an increase of million from the million of nonperforming loans at december  nonperforming loans were million at december  we reported million of net charge offs  or of average loans during compared to  in net charge offs or of average loans during and million in net charge offs during loan growth during was million or approximately 
over half of the charge offs recorded in and approximately of the non performing loans at december  related to the block of loans discussed above 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees from trust and brokerage services grew resulting from an increasing base of accounts and assets under management  and was million for compared to million for and million in loan broker fees were  during  an increase of  or from  for loan broker fees were  for the increase in was attributable to an effort to place less real estate mortgages in our portfolio and to sell them to the secondary market 
we also received a large fee for brokering a commercial real estate transaction in the fourth quarter 
deposit service charges were  in  showing an increase of  or from the increase was driven by the implementation of a new over draft protection plan  which accounted for  of the increase 
deposit service charges decreased  or between and other fee income decreased as a result of a change in the way in which merchant card income and expenses were recorded on the income statement 
prior to  the expenses associated with merchant cards were recorded in the non interest expense section under processing expenses 
however  in these expenses were netted with the income and posted in non interest income 
excluding this reclassification  non interest income increased  from to in addition to the above  noninterest income results included a minimal loss on the sale of securities available for sale 
there were no gains or losses on the sale of afs securities in and a loss of  in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million or during over the increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the infrastructure growth of the bank  expenses associated with the indianapolis office  and the significant increase in fdic insurance premiums 
salary and benefit costs increased  or  and were of total noninterest expenses 
while there was only an increase of full time equivalent employees fte comparing december verse december of  the average number ftes for was compared to in we incurred  of expense related to the indianapolis office  which was closed during the second quarter of occupancy and equipment costs increased  or  and were million or of total non interest expenses 
occupancy and equipment costs increased as a result of the construction of the warsaw branch  as well as buy outs on our indianapolis and angola leases 
we announced the closure of our angola branch during the fourth quarter of and effective during the first quarter of loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to legal costs associated with the indianapolis office and loan collection costs 
data processing expenses increased by  or 
as noted above  due to the reclassification of merchant card expenses  approximately  of processing costs were recorded against non interest income 
therefore  the increase was much higher primarily due to our increased infrastructure  which causes the need for greater storage capacity with our data warehousing supplier 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic increased by  from to the increase was due to a change in the assessment formula applied by the fdic to all insured banks 
other various expense categories increased during  such as business development  communication  and courier services  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was million for  million for and  for  which reflected a  or increase in and a  or increase from  as compared to the prior year 
marketing expense and office expense decreased from to by  and  respectively 
during  salaries and benefits costs were million  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million 
additional large overhead expenses in included costs for professional fees and services  which amounted to million and data processing expenses of  significant noninterest expenses during were million for salary and benefit costs  million for occupancy and equipment costs  and  for loan and professional costs 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high but reflects expected infrastructure costs associated with growth  as well as certain non recurring costs discussed above 
as anticipated  improvement in the efficiency ratio is dependent upon the growth in earning assets along with the development of fee based products and the resulting increases in revenue 
management expects that as additional asset growth and operating efficiencies are realized we will earn more on the larger base of earning assets  while operating costs will increase at a lesser rate  resulting in an improved efficiency ratio 
income taxes expense 
during  we recorded million of income tax benefit 
in and  we recorded million and million respectively  in income tax expense 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for the tax benefit in is the result of the net loss posted  as well as certain tax exempt interest income 
the significant reduction in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to additional tax exempt investment income and the formation of an investment subsidiary structure including the establishment of a real estate investment trust 
the ownership structure of this real estate investment trust provides us with an alternative vehicle for raising capital should we so desire  as well as providing us with certain state income tax benefits  which will lower our effective state tax rate for the year and future 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
affecting the decrease in stockholders equity during was a net loss of million  dividends of  and the repurchase of common stock of  this was somewhat offset by  for the net exercise of stock options  and  from stock option compensation expense per fasb r 
stockholders equity increased during from net income of million  by  in the net exercise of stock options   from stock option compensation expense per fasb r  and  from dividends to shareholders 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends of per share in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to continue paying a quarterly dividend of per share commencing with the first quarter dividend payment 
liquidity and capital ratios december loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
we showed moderate deposit growth in of million and substantial growth in of million 
we mainly generated deposits from in market sources  however  we expanded our funding base during to include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities 
during we further expanded our funding base to include brokered deposits 
at december   the balance of non brokered national market cds  brokered cds  and fhlb borrowings were  million and million respectively  as compared to  million and million  respectively  at december  we expect to continue to experience loan growth 
funding for the loan growth will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment its interest rate sensitivity strategy and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and december  we view this type of funding as only a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
tower financial corporation  the bank  and the trust company occupy their respective headquarters  offices and other facilities under long term operating leases and  in addition  are parties to long term contracts for data processing and operating systems

financial condition toward the end of  we elected to moderate the bank s loan growth  while continuing to grow the trust company 
total assets were million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
the significant increase in assets was mainly attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and was funded by deposit growth and the use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
asset growth had been substantial during each year since we began operations  but slowed in due to management s decision to do so 
management anticipates that  in the near term  assets will continue to grow  but at rate similar to the source of this growth will be primarily from the marketing of our products  providing banking expertise and trust services  delivering a high level of customer service and developing our branch network 
earning assets 
the bank s loan portfolio experienced moderate growth during loans were million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of  or 
the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates 
at december   commercial and commercial real estate loans were approximately of the loan portfolio and represented loans to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate category are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at million or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at million  or of total loans 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team 
residential mortgage and home equity lending  while only of loans at december   also experienced significant growth 
consumer loans  while only of total loans at december   reflected an increase of during from levels 
management believes that loan growth should continue as the bank expands its distribution network during  however  our main strategy for growth and profitability is expected to come largely from the commercial loan sector

these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectibility 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were million of potential problem loans outstanding on the watchlist 
at december   there were million of potential problem loans outstanding on the watchlist

we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations

the large increase was due to substantial increases in our consumer and health savings accounts 
money market accounts increased by million  or  as we continued to grow our on balance sheet sweep accounts 
non interest bearing checking accounts and cds over  decreased by million and million  respectively 
the decrease on the non interest bearing checking accounts was due to a drop in the business checking category 
the decrease in the cd s over  was a direct result of the increases in the other deposit categories and the use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb  thus making us less reliant on out of market jumbo cd s 
we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  in addition to federal funds purchased  we also had borrowings in the amount of million in fhlb bullet advances at december  compared to million at december  as noted above  the increase in fhlb borrowings during was the result of less reliance on out of market jumbo cd s

tct  which was dissolved in  effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on november  and was paid off in november tct effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of million on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct was november  subject to federal reserve bank prior approval  the trust preferred securities were redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning november  and we in fact redeemed them at that time 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates

a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known
