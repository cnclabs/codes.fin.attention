item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general consol energy had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net income for the period decreased in comparison to the period primarily due to several roof falls which suspended production at the buchanan mine in early july production was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine  requiring a general evacuation of the mine 
we drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere 
in the year ended december   we incurred expenses of million  primarily classified as cost of goods sold and depreciation  depletion and amortization  in relation to these activities 
these costs were offset  in part  by a million advance under consol energy insurance policies 
we have also received notice from our insurance carriers that an advance of million will be paid related to business interruption coverage  million related to the coal segment and million related to the gas segment 
we intend to pursue additional reimbursement under our existing insurance policies 
insurance coverage  after certain deductibles have been reached including a day waiting period  includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries 
there is no guarantee any additional recovery will be received under our policies 
net income was also adversely affected by reduced sales of coal from the buchanan mine 
customers who purchase coal from the mine were notified that a force majeure condition exists and deliveries under their sales agreements for coal from the mine were reduced during the year ended december  cnx gas production was also adversely impacted by the idling of the buchanan mine 
also  the period included proceeds from the insurance company of million  the coal segment recognized million and the gas segment recognized million  related to the skip hoist incident at the buchanan mine 
net income was also impacted by million of expense related to the previously recognized export excise tax receivable being reversed in the period 
the federal circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period be repaid 
the government appealed a similar case to the us supreme court 
on december  the united states supreme court granted the government s appeal to hear that case 
the supreme court s granting of the appeal makes collection of the refund and interest by consol energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the supreme court during under the statute on which our claim for this period is based 
accordingly  consol energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the supreme court decides the appeal 
we intend to vigorously pursue this action  although there is no assurance that consol energy will receive any tax refund 
net income in the period was also impacted by a lower volume of produced coal sales  and higher cost per ton sold 
net income was also lower due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization related to the additional assets received in the july  acquisition of amvest 
income tax expense also adversely impacted the period to period comparison 
in  income tax expenses were reduced by the release of certain valuation allowances related to state income taxes in pennsylvania and west virginia 
reductions to net income were offset  in part  by two transactions which occurred in the period  an asset exchange and an asset sale that resulted in pretax income of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
net income reductions were also offset  in part  by the march settlement agreement with the combined fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of payments to the combined fund 
total pre tax income  including interest  recognized related to the combined fund settlement was approximately million 
reductions to net income were also offset  in part  by lower salary pension costs 
our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy and its subsidiaries 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlement curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year  which for consol energy is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized 
the total accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately million of expense 
the total accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately million of expense 

table of contents total coal sales for the year ended december  were million tons  of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  our equity affiliates  consolidated variable interest entities  or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the year ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  consolidated variable interest entities  or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
company produced coal production was million tons  including our portion of equity affiliates and consolidated variable interest entities  for the year ended december  compared to million tons for the year ended december  production was lower due to the continued idling of the buchanan mine as discussed above  mcelroy mine had lower production due to poor geological conditions and the idling of certain central appalachian mines due to market conditions 
lower production was offset  in part  by production from the amvest mines that were acquired on july  produced coalbed methane gas sales volumes  including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates  increased to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  compared with billion cubic feet in the year ended december  period 
sales volumes in the period increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program  offset by reduced active and sealed gob production related to the idling of the buchanan mine 
our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including sales of equity affiliates increased to per thousand cubic feet in the year ended december  compared with per thousand cubic feet in the year ended december  in january  consol energy announced its intentions to offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of cnx gas corporation that it does not currently own in a stock for stock transaction 
consol energy currently owns of the approximately million shares of cnx gas common stock outstanding 
in july  production at the buchanan mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine  requiring a general evacuation of the mine by employees 
the mine atmosphere was continually monitored to determine the impact of the roof falls on the mine s ventilation system and the overall mine atmosphere 
two mine atmosphere monitoring stations showed levels of carbon monoxide above ambient levels for several months after the roof falls damaged the ventilation controls 
efforts to eliminate carbon monoxide in the mine were narrowed to an underground area about feet in diameter into which the company pumped inert gas through a number of bore holes that had been drilled 
the underground area of the buchanan mine encompasses about five square miles 
in compliance with safety agency requirements  the mine was temporarily sealed in late november as a final step before reentry into the mine 
on january   the restart of the fans was approved by the commonwealth of virginia department of mines  minerals and energy  and by the federal mine safety and health administration 
the temporary mine seals were removed and the ventilation fans were restarted 
specially trained mine rescue teams re entered the mine on january  and are in the process of evaluating the extent of damage to the mine s ventilation system and making temporary repairs 
on july   consol energy acquired amvest corporation and certain subsidiaries and affiliates amvest for a cash payment  net of cash acquired  of approximately million in a transaction accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
the coal reserves acquired consist of approximately million tons of high quality  low sulfur steam and high volatile metallurgical coal 
also included in the acquisition were four coal preparation plants  several fleets of modern mining equipment and a common short line railroad that connects the coal preparation plants to the csx and norfolk and southern rail interchanges 
the results of operations of the acquired entities are included in consol energy s consolidated statement of income as of august  the amvest acquisition  when combined with consol energy s subsidiaries adjacent coal reserves  creates a large contiguous block of coal reserves in the central appalachian region 
also  included in the acquisition was a highly skilled workforce proficient in central appalachian surface mining 
this workforce combined with consol energy s and its subsidiaries underground mining expertise will allow us to build and transfer knowledge among operations to focus the best skill sets to development requirements of the various parts of this reserve block
