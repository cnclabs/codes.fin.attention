item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion 
the following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry during fiscal during fiscal worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
cdma subscribers  including both g cdmaone and g cdma x  xev do  wcdma and hspa  are approximately of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date 
g subscribers all cdma based grew to approximately million worldwide by september   up approximately year over year  including approximately million cdma x xev do subscribers and approximately million wcdma hspa subscribers 
cdma based device shipments totaled approximately million units  an increase of over the million units shipped in fiscal in the handset market  cdma based unit shipments grew an estimated year over year  compared to an estimated year over year growth across all technologies 
the average selling price of cdma based devices was estimated to be approximately  up from the prior year 
we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma based wireless devices  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal we entered into new license and settlement agreements with nokia corporation nokia inc nokia that cover gsm gprs edge  cdma  wcdma including hspa  td scdma  ofdma including lte  umb and wimax and other products and resolve all pending litigation between the parties 
also  as a result  nokia withdrew its complaint with the european commission as to our licensing and other business practices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million in revenues as a result of the execution of the agreements 
consideration provided to us under the new license agreement with nokia included  among other things  a non refundable up front payment of billion  ongoing royalties and the assignment of patents that we recorded in intangible assets in the amount of billion 
according to wireless intelligence  an independent source of wireless operator data 
derived from reports provided by our licensees manufacturers during the year and our own estimates of unreported activity 
based on current reports by strategy analytics  a global research and consulting firm  in their global handset market share updates 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 

table of contents qct is a leading developer and supplier of cdma based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  data cards and infrastructure equipment 
the integrated circuits for wireless devices include the mobile station modem msm  radio frequency rf and power management pm devices 
these integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication  multimedia and global positioning functions  radio conversion between rf and baseband signals and power management 
qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the wireless operator s base station equipment 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing business model  we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for back end assembly and test services 
we refer to this two stage manufacturing business model as integrated fabless manufacturing ifm 
qtl grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc  and or based on a fixed per unit amount 
qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues have been generated through our licensees sales of cdmaone  cdma and wcdma products 
qwi  which includes qualcomm enterprise services qes  qualcomm internet services qis  qualcomm government technologies qgov and firethorn  generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services  software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qes sells equipment  software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets  products and workforce 
qes also sells products that operate on the globalstar low earth orbit satellite based telecommunications system and provides related services 
through september  qes has shipped approximately  terrestrial based and satellite based communications systems 
qis provides brew based binary runtime environment for wireless products that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry 
qis also provides qchat  which enables virtually instantaneous push to talk functionality on cdma based wireless devices 
the qgov division provides development  hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to united states government agencies 
firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable financial institutions and wireless operators to offer mobile commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi manages the company s strategic investment activities  including mediaflo usa  inc mediaflo usa  the company s wholly owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary 
qsi also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma based products and services 
our strategy is to invest in cdma based operators  licensed device manufacturers and early stage companies that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology 
our mediaflo usa subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicasting network based on our mediaflo media distribution system mds and flo technology 
this network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the united states 
the commercial availability of the mediaflo usa service to retail wireless consumers continues to be determined by our wireless operator partners 
mediaflo usa s network uses the mhz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide 
additionally  mediaflo usa has and will continue to procure  aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers regardless of whether they operate cdma or gsm wcdma networks in the united states 
distribution  marketing  billing and customer relationships remain functions that are provided primarily by our wireless operator partners 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future  which may include distribution of our ownership interest in mediaflo usa to our stockholders in a spin off transaction 

table of contents nonreportable segments include the qualcomm mems technologies division  which is developing an interferometric modulator imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure combined with thin film optics  the qualcomm flarion technologies division  which is developing ofdm ofdma technologies  the mediaflo technologies division  which is developing our mediaflo technology and markets mediaflo for deployment outside of the united states  and other product initiatives 
looking forward the deployment of g networks cdma and wcdma enables higher voice capacity and data rates  thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia 
as a result  we expect continued growth in demand for g products and services around the world 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business we believe the recent global financial crisis and the resulting slowdown in global economies is causing current contraction in the channel inventory and will likely result in lower consumer demand and prices for cdma based devices  among other things  adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 
in addition  the financial crisis has  and may continue to have  an impact on the value of our marketable securities portfolio and net investment income 
the deployment and upgrading of cdma networks is expected to continue 
o more than wireless operators have launched cdma x  and o more than wireless operators have deployed the higher data speeds of xev do and more than wireless operators have deployed commercial ev do revision a networks 
gsm operators are expected to continue transitioning to wcdma networks 
o more than gsm operators have migrated their networks to wcdma  and o more than wireless operators have upgraded and launched commercial hsdpa networks  and more than wireless operators have upgraded and launched commercial hsupa networks 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to high volumes and vibrant competition in marketplaces around the world 
as more operators deploy the higher data speeds of hspa and ev do revision a and as manufacturers introduce additional highly featured  converged devices  we expect consumer demand for advanced g devices to accelerate 
to meet growing demand for advanced g wireless devices and increased multimedia msm functionality  we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of multimedia products  software and services for the wireless industry 
however  we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal will not reach commercialization until several years in the future 
we expect demand for low end wireless devices to continue to grow and have developed a family of qualcomm single chip qsc products  which integrate the baseband  radio frequency and power management functions into one chip  lowering component counts and enabling faster time to market for our customers 
while we continue to invest resources aggressively to expand our qsc product family to address the low end market more effectively with cdma based products  we still face significant competition from gsm based products  particularly in emerging markets 
we will continue to invest in the evolution of cdma and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies  each optimized for specific services  including the following products and technologies o the continued evolution of cdma based technologies  including the long term roadmaps of xev do and high speed packet access hspa  o ofdm and ofdma based technologies  o our service applications platform  content delivery services and user interfaces  o our mediaflo mds and flo technology for delivery of multimedia content  and o our imod display technology 

table of contents in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business and results of operations over the next several months we will continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
for example  we expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation  including our ongoing disputes with broadcom  and to appear in front of administrative and regulatory bodies  including the european commission  the korea fair trade commission and the japan fair trade commission to defend our business model and to rebuff efforts by companies seeking to gain competitive advantage or negotiating leverage 
we have been and will continue evaluating and providing reasonable assistance to our customers 
this includes  in some cases  certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of the litigation in which we are involved 
according to public reports made available at www 
cdg 
org 
as reported by the global mobile suppliers association  an international organization of wcdma and gsm global system for mobile communications suppliers in their october reports 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in south korea  china  japan and the united states comprised   and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues for fiscal  as compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal  and   and  respectively  for fiscal we distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products  software or services are delivered and  for qtl s licensing and royalty revenues  the invoiced addresses of our licensees 
the increase in revenues from customers in south korea from and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  to in fiscal is primarily attributable to increased shipments of integrated circuits to cdma device manufacturers with locations in south korea and royalty revenues from customers in south korea 
combined revenues from customers in japan and the united states decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily due to the increased activity by manufacturers with locations in south korea 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based payments  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  royalties and license fees for our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our estimates 
we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements and other volume related rebate programs 
such reductions to revenue are estimates  based on a number of factors  including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements 
we license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee  typically five to fifteen years 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
as of september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets received or  for non monetary exchanges  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we also hold investments in other marketable securities  including non investment grade debt securities  equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds  corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities 
these investments  which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss  totaled billion at september  we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in other than temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities 

table of contents share based payments 
we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas r  share based payment 
we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of fas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under fas r for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
at september   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was billion  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period 
total stock options granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option pricing model binomial model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under fas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because valuation model assumptions are subjective  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation awards 
there is not currently a generally accepted market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
although we estimate the fair value of employee share based awards in accordance with fas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  the option pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model 
we utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years  and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years 
the weighted average volatility assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
fas r includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility 
we believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of us treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant 
the weighted average risk free interest rate assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
we do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments  but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the dividend yield assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
dividends and or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance  stock repurchase programs  mergers and acquisitions  and other sources and uses of cash 
while our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future  it may be subject to substantial change  and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors 

table of contents the post vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information 
the weighted average post vesting forfeiture rate assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
the suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information 
the weighted average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share or 
income taxes 
on october   we adopted the accounting provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of the adoption  we increased our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by million and accounted for the cumulative effect of this change as a decrease to retained earnings 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note income taxes for additional information 
as of september   our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits was million 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
for example  during fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million resulting from the completion of audits of our fiscal and federal tax returns 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of september   gross deferred tax assets were billion 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   we had gross deferred tax assets of million related to capital losses and million related to foreign and state net operating losses 
we can only use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains 
based upon our assessments of when capital gains and losses will be realized  we estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all of the temporary and other than temporary capital losses that were recorded through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize  of which million was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive loss in fiscal we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains  the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses  capital gains and taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately billion as of september  should we repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 

table of contents we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
other than amounts relating to the broadcom corporation v 
qualcomm incorporated matters  we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities  while possible  are not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct  qtl and qwi segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from sales of integrated circuit products increased billion  resulting primarily from an increase of billion related to higher unit shipments  mostly consisting of msm and accompanying rf and pm integrated circuits  and an increase of million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products 
revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of cdma based products reported by qtl s licensees other than nokia  driven by the continued adoption of wcdma at higher average selling prices than cdma and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal included million attributable to both fiscal and related to the new agreements with nokia 
revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal included royalty payments from nokia only for sales of nokia products through april  cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues included million in share based compensation in both fiscal and research and development expenses 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products  next generation cdma and ofdma technologies  the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services  including lower cost devices  the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing  the convergence of multiband  multimode  multinetwork products and technologies  third party operating systems and services platforms 
the technologies supporting these initiatives may include cdma x  xev do  ev do revision a  ev do revision b  wcdma  hsdpa  hsupa  hspa and ofdma 
research and development expenses related to the development of our flo technology  mediaflo mds  imod display products using mems technology  brew products and mobile commerce applications increased by million 
research and development expenses in fiscal included share based compensation and in process research and development of million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee related expenses and a million increase in certain professional fees  primarily related to patent activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal net investment income 
net investment income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the net decrease was primarily comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income corporate and other segments qsi interest expense net realized gains on investments corporate and other segments qsi other than temporary losses on investments corporate and other segments qsi gains on derivative instruments equity in earnings losses of investees the decrease in interest and dividend income on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was primarily a result of lower interest rates earned on interest bearing securities 
other than temporary losses in fiscal included million recognized in the fourth quarter on marketable securities held by corporate and other segments 
both other than temporary losses on marketable securities and the decrease in net realized gains on corporate investments were generally related to depressed securities values caused by a major disruption in us and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking  finance and housing industries 
this disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities 
income tax expense

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion at september   a decrease of million from september  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  consisted of billion held by foreign subsidiaries with the remaining balance of billion held domestically 
due to tax considerations  we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically 
total cash provided by operating activities was billion during fiscal  compared to billion during fiscal net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was billion during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal on march   we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to billion of our common stock 
the billion stock repurchase program replaced a billion stock repurchase program  of which approximately million remained authorized for repurchases 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date 
during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for billion 
at september   we had not repurchased any of our shares under the billion stock repurchase program 
we declared and paid dividends totaling million  million and million  or  and per common share  during fiscal  and  respectively 
on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share on our common stock  payable on january  to stockholders of record as of december  we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders 
since september  there has been a major disruption in us and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking  finance and housing industries 
this disruption was evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities 
at september  and october   gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were million and approximately million  respectively  and gross unrealized losses were million and approximately billion  respectively 
our analyses of the severity and duration of price declines  market research  industry reports  economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of issuers indicate that it is reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses to recover within a reasonable period of time 
further  we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities until they recover 
as a result  we do not believe the decline in the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio will materially affect our liquidity 
at september   we classified our auction rate securities with recorded values of million as noncurrent assets due to a disruption in credit markets that caused the auction mechanism to fail to set market clearing rates and provide liquidity for sellers 
however  a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer of the underlying security 
our auction rate securities are predominantly rated aaa aaa  are collateralized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the us government and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms 
the cash values of our auction rate securities  which are held by a foreign subsidiary  may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the securities are called by the issuer or the underlying securities have been prepaid or have matured 
due to the combined strength of our significant cash  short term investments and operating cash flows  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of auction rate securities to affect our operating plans 
accounts receivable increased greater than during fiscal primarily due to a billion trade receivable for which we received payment in october related to the new agreements with nokia  an increase of million in other trade accounts receivable and an increase of million related to amounts receivable for redemptions of money market funds for which we received partial payment in october days sales outstanding related to other trade accounts receivable were days at september  compared to days at september  the increase in other trade accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to increased revenues for integrated circuits and the timing of cash receipts for related receivables

the accounting provisions of fas for financial assets and financial liabilities will be effective for our fiscal beginning september  the adoption of fas for financial assets and financial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and we are in the process of determining the effect such adoption will have on our financial statement disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit risk 
since september  there has been a major disruption in us and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking  finance and housing industries 
this disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities 
the result has been depressed security values and widening credit spreads in most types of investment and non investment grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities 
we have no direct investments in the lowest credit quality  or subprime  mortgages  nor do we have investments collateralized by assets that include subprime mortgages 
we have indirect exposure to subprime mortgages to the extent of our investments in large  diversified financial companies  commercial banks  insurance companies and public private investment funds that participate or invest in subprime mortgage loans  mortgage insurance or loan servicing  which could impact the fair values of our securities 
at september   we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of fixed and floating rate  investment grade marketable securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  non investment grade bank loans and bonds  preferred stocks  equities and other securities that have been affected by these credit market concerns and had temporary gross unrealized losses of million 
at october   gross unrealized losses of our marketable securities portfolio were approximately billion 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these and other similarly affected securities if us credit and equity markets do not stabilize and recover to previous levels in the coming quarters 
we engage in transactions in which certain fixed income and equity securities are loaned to selected broker dealers 
we may incur a loss in the event that a broker does not return our securities  the collateral value is insufficient or cannot be maintained at required values or the lending agent fails to restore or pay us the cash value of our loaned securities 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest bearing securities 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed interest bearing securities could lose value 
when the general economy weakens significantly  as it has recently  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 

table of contents the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions no single thereafter maturity total fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
equity price risk 
the recent major disruption in us and foreign credit and financial markets caused increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares 
we have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equities held by mutual and exchange traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
the recorded values of marketable equity securities decreased to billion at september  from billion at september  the recorded values of equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares decreased to billion at september  from billion at september  the combined recorded values of marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares decreased by approximately million due to price declines and by approximately million as a result of actions taken to reduce our exposure to equity investments 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or million 
at october   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares were approximately million 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
at september   we had a net asset of million related to our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of cdma and wcdma products 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions  which could materially impact our results 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 

table of contents financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
