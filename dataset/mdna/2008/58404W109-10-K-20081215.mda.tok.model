item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare provider focused primarily on providing high acuity services  predominantly the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we own and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians whom we believe have established reputations for clinical excellence 
we also have partnerships with community hospital systems  and we manage the cardiovascular program of various hospitals operated by other parties 
we opened our first hospital in and currently have ownership interests in and operate nine hospitals  including seven in which we own a majority interest 
each of our majority owned hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital that provides a wide range of health services with a focus on cardiovascular care 
each of our hospitals has a twenty four hour emergency room staffed by emergency department physicians 
the hospitals in which we have ownership interests have a total of licensed beds and are located predominately in high growth markets in seven states arizona  arkansas  california  louisiana  new mexico  south dakota  and texas 
we are currently in the process of developing a new hospital in kingman  arizona 
we expect this hospital to open in late or early this hospital is designed to accommodate a total of licensed beds and will initially open with licensed beds 
we expanded our patient beds by licensed beds at arkansas heart hospital earlier this year and just completed a bed addition at texsan heart hospital in august we are expanding our licensed beds by at louisiana medical center and heart hospital with remaining capacity for an additional beds at that hospital 
this expansion is expected to open in we also have plans to expand our bakersfield heart hospital by inpatient beds and emergency department beds that will diversify the services offered by the hospital 
in addition to our hospitals  we currently own and or manage cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
eight of these facilities are located at hospitals operated by other parties 
these facilities offer invasive diagnostic and  in some cases  therapeutic procedures 
the remaining seven facilities are not located at hospitals and offer only diagnostic procedures 
we believe our facilities provide superior clinical outcomes  which  together with our ability to provide management capabilities and capital resources  positions us to expand upon our relationships with physicians and community hospitals to increase our presence in existing and new markets 

table of contents basis of consolidation 
we have included in our consolidated financial statements hospitals and cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities over which we exercise substantive control  including all entities in which we own more than a interest  as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we have used the equity method of accounting for entities  including variable interest entities  in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control  and are not the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  for all periods presented  one of the hospitals in which we hold a minority interest  avera heart hospital of south dakota  is excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold a portion of our equity interest in harlingen medical center  therefore  beginning in july  we began excluding this hospital from net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
similarly  a number of our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated medcath partners division 
our minority interest in the results of operations for the periods discussed for these entities is recognized as part of the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in our statements of income in accordance with the equity method of accounting 
we sold our equity interests in tucson heart hospital in and we sold our equity interests in heart hospital of lafayette and the net assets of dayton heart hospital in accordingly  for all periods presented  the results of operations for these hospitals have been excluded from continuing operations and are reported in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
same facility hospitals 
our policy is to include  on a same facility basis  only those facilities that were open and operational during the full current and prior fiscal year comparable periods 
for example  on a same facility basis for our consolidated hospital division for the fiscal year ended september   we exclude the results of operations of harlingen medical center  which  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the entire fiscal  ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary due to the sale of a portion of the hospital 
revenue sources by division 
the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated below 
year ended september  division hospital medcath partners corporate and other net revenue revenue sources by payor 
we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects those age and older  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
year ended september  payor medicare medicaid commercial and other  including self pay total consolidated net revenue a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from federal and state governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  and we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a 
table of contents percentage of total consolidated net revenue will remain significant in future periods 
our payor mix may fluctuate in future periods due to changes in reimbursement  market and industry trends with self pay patients and other similar factors 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may significantly affect our business 
in addition  reimbursement is generally subject to adjustment following audit by third party payors  including the fiscal intermediaries who administer the medicare program for centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
final determination of amounts due providers under the medicare program often takes several years because of such audits  as well as resulting provider appeals and the application of technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might result from these programs  however  due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
see business reimbursement and regulation 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments 
the majority of our contractual adjustments are system generated at the time of billing based on either government fee schedules or fee schedules contained in our managed care agreements with various insurance plans 
portions of our contractual adjustments are performed manually and these adjustments primarily relate to patients that have insurance plans with whom our hospitals do not have contracts containing discounted fee schedules  also referred to as non contracted payors and patients that have secondary insurance plans following adjudication by the primary payor 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
while subsequent adjustments to the systematic contractual allowances can arise due to denials  short payments deemed immaterial for continued collection effort and a variety of other reasons  such amounts have not historically been significant 

table of contents we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine 
from a procedural standpoint  for government payors  primarily medicare  we recognize estimated settlements in our consolidated financial statements based on filed cost reports 
we subsequently adjust those settlements as we obtain new information from audits or reviews by the fiscal intermediary and  if the result of the fiscal intermediary audit or review impacts other unsettled and open cost reports  then we recognize the impact of those adjustments 
we estimate current year settlements based on models designed to approximate our cost report filings and revise our estimates in february of each year upon completion of the actual cost report and tentative settlement 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted  and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
we provide care to patients who meet certain criteria under our charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported as net revenue 
our managed diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income arrangements as services are rendered 
in addition  certain diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories recognize additional revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease arrangements 
net revenue from our owned diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors  and others as services are rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable principally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our medcath partners division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
when possible  we will attempt to collect co payments from patients prior to admission for inpatient services as a part of the pre registration and registration processes 
if unsuccessful  we will also attempt to reach a mutually agreed upon payment arrangement at that time 
to the extent possible  the estimated amount of the patient s financial responsibility is determined based on the services to be performed  the patient s applicable co payment amount or percentage and any identified remaining deductible and co insurance percentages 
if payment arrangements are not provided upon admission or only a partial payment is obtained  we will attempt to collect any estimated remaining patient balance upon discharge 
we also comply with the requirements under applicable law concerning collection of medicare co payments and deductibles 
patients who come to our hospitals for outpatient services are expected to make payment or adequate financial arrangements before receiving services 
patients who come to the emergency room are screened and stabilized to the extent of the hospital s capability for any emergency medical condition in accordance with applicable laws  rules and other regulations in order that financial arrangements do not delay such screening  stabilization  and appropriate disposition 
general and professional liability risk 
for the past three fiscal years we carried a one year claims made policy providing coverage for medical malpractice claim amounts of retained liability per claim  subject to an additional amounts of retained liability per claim and an aggregate for claims reported if deemed necessary 
in june  we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage for medical malpractice claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 

table of contents because of our self insured retention levels  we are required to recognize an estimated expense liability for the amount of our retained liability applicable to each malpractice claim 
as of september  and september   the total estimated liability for our self insured retention on medical malpractice claims  including an estimated amount for incurred but not reported claims  was approximately million and million  respectively  which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain this reserve based on actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  who bases the estimates on our historical experience with claims and assumptions about future events 
in addition to reserves for medical malpractice  we also maintain reserves for our self insured workman s compensation  healthcare and dental coverage 
as of september  and september   our total estimated reserve for self insured liabilities on employee health and dental claims was million  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain this reserve based on our historical experience with claims 
we maintained commercial stop loss coverage for our health and dental insurance program of  per plan participant through june   at which time the commercial stop loss coverage per plan participant increased  to  we continually review our estimates for self insured liabilities and record adjustments as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the changes to the estimated liabilities are included in current operating results 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  including such factors as changes in medical costs and changes in actual experience  there is a reasonable possibility that the recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
also  there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased 
other intangible assets primarily consist of the value of management contracts 
with the exception of goodwill  intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill annually on september for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
for the years ended september   and  we analyzed goodwill for impairment 
the results of our analysis indicated that our goodwill was not impaired and no additional impairment was required in fiscal  or for our continuing operations 
the goodwill calculation for fiscal excluded dayton heart hospital  which is reported as a discontinued operation 
a separate goodwill impairment test related to this hospital was performed and million of goodwill was allocated to this hospital and was written off as part of the net gain on the sale of the hospital during the third quarter of fiscal the goodwill calculation for fiscal excluded heart hospital of lafayette  which is reported as a discontinued operation 
a separate goodwill impairment test related to this hospital was performed and it was determined that goodwill impairment for this hospital did exist 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal the impairment charge is included as a component of income loss from discontinued operations in the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september  during the year ended september  the company purchased additional equity interests in the heart hospital of new mexico and texsan heart hospital resulting in an increase to goodwill of million and million  respectively 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
the determination of whether or not long lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets 
changes 
table of contents in our strategy  assumptions and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long lived assets 
during the year ended september   the operating performance of one of our facilities  heart hospital of lafayette  was significantly below expectations 
following the consideration of the performance of the hospital as well as other strategic alternatives for the hospital  we decided to seek to dispose of the heart hospital of lafayette 
accordingly  the hospital is classified as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements 
we evaluated the carrying value of our interest in the hospital at september   to ensure it was equal to or greater than the fair market value to determine whether or not impairment existed 
based upon this evaluation it was determined that our investment in heart hospital of lafayette was not impaired and recorded no impairment charge for the year ended september  related to this asset 
during the year ended september  our impairment evaluation resulted in total impairment charges of million  which are included in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the disposition of heart hospital of lafayette 
also during the year ended september   we discontinued the implementation of certain nurse staffing software and as a result  a million impairment charge was recognized to write off the costs incurred to date on such software 
earnings allocated to minority interests 
earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
because our hospitals are owned as joint ventures  each hospital s earnings and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our physician and community hospital partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages in the hospital 
if  however  the cumulative net losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and committed capital obligations of our partners  then we are required  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  to recognize a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s losses  instead of the smaller pro rata share of the losses that normally would be allocated to us based upon our percentage ownership 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s losses would reduce our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
when the same hospital has earnings in a subsequent period  a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s earnings will be allocated to us to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of that hospital s losses 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s earnings would increase our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
the determination of disproportionate losses to be allocated is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partner s contributed capital  obligation to contribute additional capital to provide working capital loans  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our fiscal years  and  our disproportionate recognition of earnings and losses in our hospitals had a net positive negative impact of million  million  and million  respectively  on our reported income from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we have no cumulative disproportionate loss allocations 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in a disproportionate allocation position depending on their results of operations in future periods 
accounting for gains on capital transactions of subsidiary 
a gain on the issuance of units in one of our subsidiaries  harlingen medical center  llc hmc  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal as a component of stockholders equity  in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin topic h sab topic h 
the gain resulted from the difference between the carrying amount of our investment in hmc prior to the issuance of units and our equity investment immediately following the issuance of units 
we determined that recognition of the gain as a component of equity was appropriate since hmc has historically experienced net operating losses and due to uncertainty surrounding future transactions that may involve further dilution of our equity interest in hmc 
future issuances of units to third parties will further dilute our ownership percentage and may give rise to additional gains or losses based on the offering price in comparison to the carrying value of our investment 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes are computed on the pretax income based on current tax law 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or their future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
share based compensation on october   the company adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model and to expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period in the company s statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for stock options issued to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and provided pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for stock option grants made as if the fair value method of measuring compensation cost for stock options granted had been applied 
under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation expense was recognized for options granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the grant date 
in september  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a plan to accelerate the vesting of substantially all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees with the condition that the optionee enter into a sale restriction agreement which provides that if the optionee exercises a stock option prior to its originally scheduled vesting date while employed by the company  the optionee will be prohibited from selling the share of stock acquired upon exercise of the option until the date the option would have become vested had it not been accelerated 
all new stock options granted since september  have immediate vesting with the same sale restriction 
as a result  share based compensation is recorded on the option grant date 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of october   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s financial statements as of and for the years ended september   and reflect the impact of sfas no

r 
the company has elected to follow the provisions of staff position no 
r as required under sfas no 
r in calculating the share based compensation expense for the years ended september   and the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant 
the company used the black scholes option pricing model with the range of weighted average assumptions used for option grants noted in the following table 
the expected life of the stock options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and the range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior with respect to the options granted to them and has been determined based on an annual analysis of historical and expected exercise and cancellation behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect on the date of the grant 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the company s common stock and the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies

as part of the recapitalization  our ownership in harlingen medical center was reduced from a majority ownership of to a minority ownership of 
due to this change in ownership  we began accounting for harlingen medical center as an equity investment at the beginning of the fiscal quarter ended september  as opposed to including harlingen medical center in our consolidated results of operations 
as such  our fiscal year and our fourth quarter of fiscal consolidated results exclude the financials results of harlingen medical center 
the following management discussion and analysis focuses on same facility results of operations and  therefore  excludes harlingen medical center from the results of both fiscal and fiscal when appropriate 

table of contents net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million decrease in net revenue  our hospitals generated a million decrease  our medcath partners division generated a million decrease  our cardiology consulting and management operations generated a million increase  and our corporate and other division generated a million decrease 
on a same facility basis our hospital net revenue increased million  or from the prior fiscal year 
we have experienced a shift in inpatient to outpatient procedures during fiscal on a same facility basis our admissions were down for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  however our adjusted admissions  which take into consideration outpatient visits  increased as a result of the shift from inpatient to outpatient procedures 
outpatient net revenue increased from of total same facility hospital net revenue for fiscal to for fiscal during fiscal we experienced an increase in net revenues of and from outpatient drug eluting stents and bare metal stents  respectively  when compared to fiscal net revenue from inpatient drug eluting stents and bare metal stents were down and  respectively  on a same facility basis in fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue has been negatively impacted by an overall increase in deductions for uncompensated care 
we commonly refer to these deductions as charity care 
charity care was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal charity care is recorded for patients that meet certain federal poverty guidelines 
the number of patients that qualified for charity care increased during fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we recognized net negative contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million related to the filing of our medicare cost reports as well as other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments 
further  the fiscal year ended september  was negatively impacted as a result of recording a million reduction in net revenue for a portion of certain federal healthcare billings reimbursed in prior years 
see note contingencies and commitments of our consolidated financial statements 
in contrast  we recognized negative contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million during fiscal related to our medicare cost reports and other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments for prior fiscal periods 
personnel expense 
personnel expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased to from for the comparable periods 
on a same facility basis  personnel expense increased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is mainly due to cost of living wage adjustments made during the first quarter of fiscal and an increase in labor costs due to the continued demand for nurses and other technicians in several of our markets 
on october   we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
using this methodology and since all options are immediately vested  we recognized share based compensation of million and million for the fiscal year ended september and  respectively 
medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal medical supplies expense on a same facility basis decreased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ending september  compared to for fiscal year ending september  medical supplies expense as a percentage of adjusted admission has remained flat on a same facility basis year over year 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal same facility bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal same facility bad debt expense also increased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ending september  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  due to a decrease in payments and write offs as a percentage of patient billings 
we have experienced an unfavorable trend regarding the collection of the portion of the amount due from patients after insurance and a decrease in the number of patients that qualify for medicaid 

table of contents other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal same facility other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal we continue to see an increase in contract services due to the growth in volume at several of our facilities as well as increased maintenance costs at our hospitals as machinery warranties have expired at several of our facilities 
pre opening expenses 
we incurred approximately million and million in pre opening expenses during fiscal and pre opening expenses represent costs specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september  and  we have one hospital under development  hualapai medical center in kingman  arizona 
the amount of pre opening expenses  if any  we incur in future periods will depend on the nature  timing and size of our development activities 
depreciation 
depreciation decreased to million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  on a same facility basis  depreciation increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the depreciation increase is a result of the expansion and the investment in support software at several of our facilities 
loss gain on disposal of property  equipment and other assets 
we incurred a loss on the disposal of property  equipment and other assets of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the loss was higher as a result of assets that were disposed and replaced with improved technology to ensure the highest state of the art care for our patients 
the loss for fiscal is also due to the replacement of aged assets offset by a gain on the sale of equipment by one of our managed ventures 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the overall reduction in our outstanding debt as we repurchased approximately million of our senior notes  repaid million of our reit loan at one of our facilities  repaid million of our equipment loan at another of our facilities  and repaid million of our senior secured credit facility during the fiscal year ended september  loss on early extinguishment of debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt for fiscal was million for fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   this loss consisted of a million repurchase premium and the write off of approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs related to the prepayment of a portion of our senior notes in december we also wrote off million in deferred loan acquisition costs during fiscal related to the prepayment of million of our senior secured credit facility 
further  upon early repayment of million of our equipment loan at one of our facilities  we expensed approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs  and as part of the harlingen medical center recapitalization transaction  we incurred a million repurchase premium and expensed approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs 
there was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is a result of the decrease in cash and the decrease in interest earned on cash balances during fiscal equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to growth in earnings for our unconsolidated affiliates related to our hospital division of million and an increase in earnings for several new ventures in our medcath partners division 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to our medcath partners division was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal our minority interest share of earnings can fluctuate as a result of our disproportionate share accounting for our partnership interests 
our partnership operating agreements may call for the recognition of losses or profits at amounts that are disproportionate to our partnership interest 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the reduced impact of one time permanent adjustments to derive taxable income

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed a recapitalization of harlingen medical center 
as part of the recapitalization  our ownership in harlingen medical center was reduced from a majority ownership of to a minority ownership of 
due to this change in ownership  we began accounting for harlingen medical center as an equity investment at the beginning of the fiscal quarter ended september  as opposed to including harlingen medical center in our consolidated results of operations 
as such  our fourth quarter of fiscal consolidated results exclude the financials results of harlingen medical center 
the following management discussion and analysis focuses on same facility fluctuations which excludes harlingen medical center from the results of both fiscal and fiscal when appropriate 
net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million increase in net revenue  our hospitals generated a million increase  which was partially offset by a million decrease in our medcath partners division  a million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations and a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
on a same facility basis  excluding hmc from the results of both fiscal and fiscal  our hospital net revenue increased million  or from the prior year 
same facility adjusted admissions increased and revenue per adjusted admissions increased for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  we have focused a significant amount of time and resources on the improvement of our clinical documentation process  both on an inpatient and outpatient basis 
this focus has helped improve our reimbursement on a per adjusted admissions basis in both areas 
we have successfully renegotiated a number of managed care contracts during the course of this fiscal year  which has led to higher net revenue per admission 
also contributing to the increase in net revenue over the prior fiscal year  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million for continued operations and million for discontinued operations related to the filing of our medicare cost reports as well as other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments 
by contrast  we recognized adjustments impacting our net revenue by million for continued operations and million for discontinued operations for prior period cost reports for fiscal further  the fiscal year ended september  was negatively impacted as a result of recording a million reduction in net revenue for a portion of certain federal healthcare billings reimbursed in prior years 
see note contingencies and commitments 
personnel expense 
personnel expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense decreased to from for the comparable periods 
the million increase in personnel expense was primarily due to a million increase for our same facility hospital division offset by an million reduction in share based compensation 
on october   we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
using this methodology and since all options are immediately vested  we recognized share based compensation of million and million for the fiscal year ended september and  respectively 
due to the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer as well as a new chief operating officer  the issuance of stock options during fiscal was above normal historical activity 
for our same facility hospitals  on an adjusted patient day basis  personnel expense decreased by to  per adjusted patient day for the fiscal year ended september  from  per adjusted patient day for the comparable period in the prior year 
further  excluding the share based compensation and the consolidated results of harlingen medical center  as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is mainly due to cost of living wage adjustments made during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal further  same facility hospital medical supplies expense per adjusted patient day decreased to  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal  reflecting the decrease in overall supplies volume as well as the shift in procedural mix from drug eluting stents to bare metal stents 
also  our supply chain initiatives helped us experience price reductions during the fiscal year as we experienced a decline in our most costly medical devices 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal on a same facility basis  bad debt expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal we have experienced reductions in bad debt expense due to our continued initiatives to improve our registration process to more timely and accurately identify patients eligible for third party benefits and to improve processes surrounding our billing and collection procedures 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal same facility other operating expenses increased from million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we have experienced an increase in contract services due to the growth in volume at several of our facilities as well as increased maintenance costs at our hospitals as machinery warranties have expired at several of our facilities 
pre opening expenses 
we incurred approximately million in pre opening expenses during fiscal while there were no pre opening expenses incurred in fiscal pre opening expenses represent costs specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we have one hospital under development  hualapai medical center in kingman  arizona 
the amount of pre opening expenses  if any  we incur in future periods will depend on the nature  timing and size of our development activities 
depreciation 
depreciation decreased to million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  excluding harlingen medical center  which we began accounting for as an equity investment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  depreciation remained relatively flat at million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal loss gain on disposal of property  equipment and other assets 
we incurred a gain on the disposal of property  equipment and other assets of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the current year loss is a result of several assets that were disposed and replaced with improved technology to ensure the highest state of the art care for our patients 
impairment of long lived assets 
impairment of long lived assets was million in fiscal during fiscal  management decided to discontinue the implementation of certain nurse staffing software and as a result  a million impairment charge was recognized to write off the costs incurred to date on such software 
during fiscal  no such impairment was recorded 
see critical accounting policies long lived assets 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the overall reduction in our outstanding debt as we repurchased approximately million of our senior notes  repaid million of our reit loan at one of our facilities  repaid million of our equipment loan at another of our facilities  and repaid million of our senior secured credit facility during the fiscal year ended september  loss on early extinguishment of debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt was million for fiscal while we did not incur any for fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   this loss consisted of a million repurchase premium and the write off of approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs related to the prepayment of a portion of our senior notes in december we also wrote off million in deferred loan acquisition costs during fiscal related to the prepayment of million of our senior secured credit facility 
further  upon early repayment of million of our equipment loan at one of our facilities  we expensed approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs  and as part of the harlingen medical center recapitalization transaction  we incurred a million repurchase premium and expensed approximately million of deferred loan acquisition costs 

table of contents interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net remained relatively flat at million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   we received million as a part of a settlement agreement related to a lawsuit 
the proceeds received from the settlement were offset in part by million of legal fees incurred related to the settlement 
excluding this net receipt of million  interest and other income  net  increased million from fiscal to fiscal this increase is due to higher interest earned on available cash and cash equivalents during the comparable periods  as well as higher rates of return on our short term investments 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to growth in earnings at one of the hospitals in which we hold less than a interest  as well as growth in earnings in various diagnostic ventures in which we hold less than a interest 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal our minority interest share of earnings can fluctuate as a result of our disproportionate share accounting for our partnership interests 
our partnership operating agreements may call for the recognition of losses or profits at amounts that are disproportionate to our partnership interest 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the overall increase in the effective rate is the result of several items that are not deductible for tax such as the exercise of incentive stock options and penalties incurred on contingencies 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  reflects the results of dayton heart hospital  heart hospital of lafayette and tucson heart hospital for fiscal and fiscal net loss from discontinued operations was million for fiscal compared to net income of million for fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 the company evaluated the carrying value of the long lived assets related to heart hospital of lafayette during fiscal and determined that the carrying value was in excess of the fair value 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal the million impairment charge was offset by net income related to dayton heart hospital for fiscal 
table of contents selected quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated operating results for each of our last five quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and included all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and 
table of contents physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities 
our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the decrease of million in working capital primarily resulted from cash outflows for capital expenditures as a result of our hospital expansions  the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program  and the payment of federal and state income taxes offset by cash flows from operations 
at september  million of cash was restricted and held in escrow as required by the city of kingman  arizona in conjunction with the company s development of the hualapai mountain medical center 
the escrowed funds are released upon our completion of common infrastructure construction projects affecting the city of kingman 
we anticipate the completion of the related projects and release of escrowed funds during fiscal or early during the second quarter of fiscal  we were informed by one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries that outlier payments received prior to january  would not be disputed  therefore  we reversed a reserve of million that was originally recorded to account for outlier payments that had been received in at september   we continued to carry a reserve of million for outlier payments received in the cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million and million for the years ending september  and  respectively 
the million decrease is primarily attributed to the payment of federal and state income taxes during the year ended september   offset by cash flows from operations 
our investing activities from continuing operations used net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal net cash used by investing activities for the year ended september  and was primarily capital expenditures for the development of our hospital in kingman  arizona and expansion projects at two of our existing hospitals 
our financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of million during fiscal compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the million of net cash used for financing activities for the year ended september  is primarily a result of distributions to minority partners and the repurchase of common stock under our repurchase program 
the million of net cash used for financing activities for the year ended september  is primarily a result of distributions to minority partners and the repayment of long term debt and obligations under capital leases  including a payment of million to pay off our senior secured credit facility  a payment of million to pay off one of our facility s reit loans  which matured in december  and a payment of million to pay off the equipment loan at another of our facilities 
further  during fiscal  we completed a secondary public offering in which we sold an additional million shares of common stock 
the proceeds from this offering were used to prepay million of our senior notes 
lease transaction with hmc realty 
during july  harlingen medical center transferred real property with a net book value of approximately million fair value of million to a newly formed wholly owned limited liability subsidiary  hmc realty  llc hmc realty  in exchange for hmc realty s assumption of related party and third party debt of approximately million 
subsequently  harlingen medical center entered into a lease agreement with hmc realty whereby harlingen medical center will lease the real property from hmc realty for approximately million annually for years 
subsequent to the transfer of assets and debt  hmc realty received capital contributions as described below  and harlingen medical center canceled its membership in hmc realty 
the million debt assumed by hmc realty consisted of million owed to valley baptist health system valley baptist  million owed to us for working capital loans  and the assumption of 
table of contents million in real estate debt with a third party 
we converted million of the working capital loan with hmc realty into a interest in hmc realty 
recapitalization of harlingen medical center 
during fiscal  harlingen medical center entered into two million convertible notes with valley baptist 
the first note could have been voluntarily converted by the health system into a ownership interest in harlingen medical center after the third anniversary date of issuance  or it could have been automatically converted into an ownership interest in harlingen medical center upon the achievement of specified financial targets contained in the debt agreement  up until the third anniversary date of the agreement or the fourth anniversary date of the agreement  if extended by harlingen medical center 
the second note was convertible into the same ownership interest percentage as the first note at the discretion of the health system after the conversion of the first note 
the potential ownership interest in harlingen medical center by the health system was capped at 
the notes accrued interest at per annum up until the third anniversary date  after which time the interest rate would have been increased to if the notes had not been converted 
interest payments were due quarterly 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  accounting for debt convertible into the stock of a consolidated subsidiary  eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and eitf  the meaning of indexed to a company s own stock  the convertible notes were accounted for as convertible debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the embedded conversion option in the convertible notes were not accounted for as a separate derivative 
during july  we elected  along with the original physician investors and valley baptist  to allow early conversion of the valley baptist notes into an equity interest in harlingen medical center the recapitalization 
valley baptist converted million of the convertible notes into a equity interest in harlingen medical center 
the remaining million was converted into a membership interest in hmc realty 
prior to the recapitalization  harlingen medical center had approximately million in working capital debt outstanding with us 
as a result of the recapitalization  we converted million of the debt into additional capital in harlingen medical center  converted million into a membership interest of hmc realty  and were repaid the remaining balance of the working capital note 
as a result of the transactions described above  we now own a interest in harlingen medical center  and a interest in hmc realty 
in addition  valley baptist holds a interest in harlingen medical center and a interest in hmc realty  and the remaining ownership interests in both entities are held by unrelated physician investor groups 
prior to the recapitalization  we consolidated harlingen medical center 
as a result of the recapitalization  our interest in harlingen medical center was diluted from to effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded the gain resulting from the change in ownership interest in accordance with sab topic h 
the gain resulted from the difference between the carrying amount of our investment in harlingen medical center prior to the issuance of units and our equity investment immediately following the issuance of units 
we determined that recognition of the gain as a capital transaction was appropriate because harlingen medical center had historically experienced net losses  and because of uncertainty regarding the possible future occurrence of transactions that may involve further dilution of our equity interest in harlingen medical center 
future issuances of units to third parties  if any  will further dilute our ownership percentage and may give rise to additional gains or losses based on the offering price in comparison to the carrying value of our investment 
capital expenditures 
expenditures  including accrued but unpaid amounts  for property and equipment for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
cash paid for property and equipment was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
for the year ended september   we continued the development of our hospital in kingman  arizona and the expansion projects at two of our existing hospitals  which began during the year ended september  anticipated remaining costs to complete our current expansion projects are estimated to be million 
the amount of capital expenditures we incur in future periods will depend largely on the type and size of strategic investments we make in future periods 

table of contents obligations  commitments and availability of financing 
as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we had certain cash obligations at september   which are due as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal year thereafter total long term debt obligations under capital leases total debt other long term obligations interest on indebtedness operating leases total other long term obligations contain revenue guarantees related to contracts for physician services or to physician recruiting arrangements 
in addition  we have million in unrecognized tax benefits 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
during november  we amended and restated our senior credit facility 
the amended credit facility provides for a three year term loan facility in the amount of million term loan and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million revolver  which includes a million sub limit for the issuance of stand by and commercial letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans

borrowings under the amended credit facility  excluding swing line loans  bear interest per annum at a rate equal to the sum of libor plus the applicable margin or the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
the amended credit facility continues to be guaranteed jointly and severally by us and certain of our existing and future  direct and indirect  subsidiaries and continues to be secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all of the capital stock or other ownership interests owned by us and our subsidiary guarantors in each of their subsidiaries  and  subject to certain exceptions in the credit facility all other present and future assets and properties of the medcath and the subsidiary guarantors and all the intercompany notes 
the amended credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants including a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio test  a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test and a consolidated total leverage ratio test 
the amended credit facility also contains customary restrictions on  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens  engage in mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  incur debt  declare dividends  redeem stock and repurchase  redeem and or repay other debt  make loans  advances and investments and acquisitions  and entering into transactions with affiliates 
the amended credit facility contains events of default  including cross defaults to certain indebtedness  change of control events and events of default customary for syndicated commercial credit facilities

we are required to make mandatory prepayments of principal in specified amounts upon the occurrence of certain events identified in the amended credit facility and are permitted to make voluntary prepayments of principal under the amended credit facility 
the term loan is subject to amortization of principal in quarterly installments commencing on march  the maturity date of the term loan and revolver is november  the company will use the proceeds of the million term loan  along with cash on hand  to repurchase all of the company s million outstanding senior notes  plus pay the notes repurchase premium of 
table of contents approximately million 
in addition to the repurchase premium  the company will incur approximately million in expense in its first quarter of fiscal  ending december   related to the write off of previously incurred financing cost 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
the million of the senior notes are classified as current as of september  as we have secured long term financing  as discussed above  for the remaining million 
of the outstanding debt  million was outstanding under our senior notes and million was outstanding to lenders to our hospitals 
the remaining million of debt was outstanding to lenders for medcath partners diagnostic services under capital leases and other miscellaneous indebtedness 
no amounts were outstanding to lenders under our current million revolving credit facility at september  at the same date  however  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our availability under this facility to million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we sold million shares of common stock to the public 
the million in net proceeds from this offering were used to repurchase approximately million of our outstanding senior notes and to pay approximately million of associated premiums and expenses associated with the note repurchase 
covenants related to our long term debt restrict the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of specific financial ratios and amounts and periodic financial reporting 
at september   we were in violation of a financial covenant under an equipment loan to heart hospital of lafayette 
heart hospital of lafayette is classified as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the total outstanding balance of this loan has been included in current liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  the equipment loan was subsequently paid as part of the sale of the heart hospital of lafayette 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with all other covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding debt at september  at september   we guaranteed either all or a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for equipment and other notes payable 
we provide these guarantees in accordance with the related hospital operating agreements  and we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
we also guarantee approximately of certain equipment debt of avera heart hospital of south dakota  a hospital in which we own a minority interest at september   and therefore do not consolidate the hospital s results of operations and financial position 
we provide this guarantee in exchange for a fee from the hospital 
at september   avera heart hospital of south dakota was in compliance with all covenants in the instruments governing its debt 
equipment debt guaranteed by us was immaterial at september  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of the terms  covenants and repayment schedule surrounding our debt 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our amended credit facility will be sufficient to finance our business plan  capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
intercompany financing arrangements 
we provide secured real estate  equipment and working capital financings to our majority owned hospitals 
the aggregate amount of the intercompany real estate  equipment and working capital and other loans outstanding as of september  was million 
each intercompany real estate loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s real estate  building and equipment and certain other assets 
each intercompany real estate loan typically matures in to years and accrues interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin or a fixed rate similar to terms commercially available 
each intercompany equipment loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s equipment and certain other assets 
amounts borrowed under the intercompany equipment loans are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest over terms that range from to years 
the intercompany 
table of contents equipment loans accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from to or variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany equipment loans at september  was 
we typically receive a fee from the minority partners in the subsidiary hospitals as consideration for providing these intercompany real estate and equipment loans 
we also use intercompany financing arrangements to provide cash support to individual hospitals for their working capital and other corporate needs 
we provide these working capital loans pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements between our physician and hospital investor partners and us at each of our hospitals 
these intercompany loans are evidenced by promissory notes that establish borrowing limits and provide for a market rate of interest to be paid to us on outstanding balances 
these intercompany loans are subordinate to each hospital s mortgage and equipment debt outstanding  but are senior to our equity interests and our partners equity interests in the hospital venture and are secured  subject to the prior rights of the senior lenders  in each instance by a pledge of certain of the borrowing hospital s assets 
also as part of our intercompany financing and cash management structure  we sweep cash from individual hospitals as amounts are available in excess of the individual hospital s working capital needs 
these funds are advanced pursuant to cash management agreements with the individual hospital that establish the terms of the advances and provide for a rate of interest to be paid consistent with the market rate earned by us on the investment of its funds 
these cash advances are due back to the individual hospital on demand and are subordinate to our equity investment in the hospital venture 
as of september  and september   we held million and million  respectively  of intercompany working capital and other notes and related accrued interest  net of advances from our hospitals 
because these intercompany notes receivable and related interest income are eliminated with the corresponding notes payable and interest expense at our consolidating hospitals in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amounts outstanding under these notes do not appear in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
information about the aggregate amount of these notes outstanding from time to time may be helpful  however  in understanding the amount of our total investment in our hospitals 
in addition  we believe investors and others will benefit from a greater understanding of the significance of the priority rights we have under these intercompany notes receivable to distributions of cash by our hospitals as funds are generated from future operations  a potential sale of a hospital  or other sources 
because these notes receivable are senior to the equity interests of medcath and our partners in each hospital  in the event of a sale of a hospital  the hospital would be required first to pay to us any balance outstanding under its intercompany notes prior to distributing any of the net proceeds of the sale to any of the hospital s equity investors as a return on their investment based on their pro rata ownership interests 
also  appropriate payments to us to amortize principal balances outstanding and to pay interest due under these notes are generally made to us from a hospital s available cash flows prior to any pro rata distributions of a hospital s earnings to the equity investors in the hospitals 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiary equipment loans and operating leases that are reflected in the table above and as discussed in notes and  respectively  in the consolidated financial statements 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our hospitals or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
see item a risk factors reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors could adversely impact our operating results 

table of contents inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a policy for managing risk related to exposure to variability in interest rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates and prices which includes considering entering into derivative instruments freestanding derivatives  or contracts or instruments containing features or terms that behave in a manner similar to derivative instruments embedded derivatives in order to mitigate our risks 
in addition  we may be required to hedge some or all of our market risk exposure  especially to interest rates  by creditors who provide debt funding to us 
currently one of our hospitals in which we have a minority interest and account for under the equity method entered into an interest rate swap during fiscal for purposes of hedging variable interest payments on long term debt outstanding for that hospital 
the interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge by the hospital whereby changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap flow through comprehensive income of the hospital 
potential losses of earnings and cash flows due to the market risk of the aforementioned interest rate swap are immaterial 
as of september   our indebtedness accrued interest based on fixed rates
