the minimum guaranteed amount based on the company s current operations is million per year through december for the erj family of aircraft and million per year through december for the erj family of aircraft 
the company did not record a liability for this guarantee because the company does not believe that any aircraft will be utilized below the minimum flight hour requirement during the term of the agreement 
the company has long term maintenance agreements with aviation equipment manufacturers to maintain the auxiliary power units for the erj family of aircraft and the crj regional aircraft through june and december  respectively 
the agreement has a penalty payment provision if more than twenty percent of the company s aircraft are removed from service based on the annual flight activity prior to the date of removal 
the company did not record a liability for this penalty provision because the company does not believe that more than twenty percent of their aircraft will be removed from service during the term of the agreement 
the company has long term maintenance agreements based upon flight activity with engine manufacturers through february for the crj aircraft  october for the erj family of aircraft and through december for the erj family of aircraft

the company has a long term agreement to provide  manage and repair certain airframe components and spare parts on the crj aircraft through december total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commercial commitments at december  include letters of credit totaling million expiring within one year 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
under our fixed fee arrangements with american  delta  usairways  united  continental and frontier  the company receives a fixed fee  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior service 
revenues are recognized in the period the service is provided  and we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
the reimbursement of specified costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger liability and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes  fuel  landing fees and catering 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed for reimbursement pursuant to emerging issues tax force issue eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under the company s code share agreements  the company is reimbursed an amount per aircraft designed to compensate the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with eitf no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and has been included in regional airline services revenue on the company s consolidated statements of income 
aircraft leases 
the company has aircraft that are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is responsible for all other maintenance costs of its aircraft and must meet specified return conditions upon lease expiration for both the airframes and engines 
the company is unable to estimate the liability for these return conditions as of december   because the leases expire beginning in the company will record a liability for these return conditions once the liability is probable and reasonably estimable 
impairments to long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our owned aircraft and spare parts 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
we follow a method of expensing aircraft maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
however  maintenance and repairs for engines and airframe components under power by the hour contracts  such as engines  avionics  apus  wheels and brakes  are expensed as the aircraft are operated based upon actual hours or cycles flown 
issued warrants 
warrants issued to non employees are accounted for under sfas no 
r  share based payments  and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  at fair value on the measurement date 
fair value for warrants issued to delta  for which a measurement date has occurred  have been determined based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument issued rather than the consideration received because we believe it is more reliably measured 
various option pricing models are available  however  we have used a model that allows continuous compounding of dividends which begins three years after the grant date and the dilutive effects of our initial public offering and the follow on offerings in option pricing models require estimates of dividend yield  a risk free rate commensurate with the warrant term  stock volatility and the expected life of the warrant 
each of these variables has been determined based upon relevant industry market data  our strategic business plan and consultation with appropriate professionals experienced in valuing similar equity instruments 
deferred gain delta pre petition claim and surrendered warrants 
as a result of the delta amendment  in march  we recorded a deferred credit of  which represented the net realizable value of the pre petition claim on the approval date by the bankruptcy court 
in addition  we recorded a deferred gain on the surrender of the warrants from delta of  which was net of the write off of the previously reported unamortized deferred warrant charge of  the deferred credits for the proceeds of the pre petition claim and the gain on the surrender of the warrants totaling  will be amortized as an adjustment to revenue over the weighted average aircraft in service during the term of the agreements with delta 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
in july  wexford capital llc s ownership percentage of the company was reduced to less than as a result of a follow on offering of our common stock 
as a result of this decrease in ownership  the utilization of nols generated prior to july are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of pre july nols becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the nols not expected to be utilized
