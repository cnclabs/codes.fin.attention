table of contents overview we are a global investment management company and derive the majority of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to our retail mutual funds  and to institutional  high net worth  and separately managed accounts and other investment products 
our services include fund administration  shareholder services  transfer agency  underwriting  distribution  custodial  trustee and other fiduciary services our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct brand names franklin  templeton  mutual series  bissett  fiduciary trust and darby 
we offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity  hybrid  fixed income and money market categories that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
as noted in the risk factors section set forth above in item a of this annual report on form k  the amount and mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and could negatively impact our revenues and income 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers retail banking and consumer lending services and private banking services to high net worth clients 
our consumer lending and retail banking activities include automobile lending related to the purchase  securitization  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships  consumer credit and debit cards  real estate equity lines and home equity mortgage lending 
during fiscal year  we operated in a period of sustained volatility in global financial markets  which resulted from the continuing credit crisis in the united states 
during  major banks and other financial institutions reported significant losses and write downs on assets due to substantial increases in mortgage defaults and foreclosure activities 
this also led to a loss of confidence by investors in the value of securitized mortgages and other credit related market instruments 
these events resulted in a severe liquidity problem in the banking sector  the collapse of several major financial institutions and a dramatic reduction in credit availability 
in the united states  the financial markets remained under duress due to the crisis and poor economic outlook 
in september  the liquidity and credit problem spread throughout the global financial market and evolved into a global financial crisis 
global markets have experienced unprecedented volatility 
the value of equities outside the us declined significantly  with appreciation of the us dollar magnifying the losses in dollar terms 
although the us and international governments coordinated efforts to stabilize the financial markets  the economic outlook was still uncertain and the global equity markets remained volatile 
our total assets under management declined during fiscal year  with over half of the decrease occurring in the fourth quarter 
the negative market performance resulted in lower equity valuations  and million of depreciation in our products for the year 
additionally  a shift in investor demand away from equities to lower risk investments led to a increase in redemptions  although sales decreased only slightly 
net income decreased during the year  which was primarily the result of a decrease in other income  net 
diluted earnings per share also decreased  mainly resulting from the lower net income  partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock 

table of contents despite the ongoing financial crisis  the performance of our sponsored investment products  in particular fixed income funds  was strong on a relative basis 
our simple monthly average assets under management increased during fiscal year  and our operating income increased 
we attribute this to the high level of assets under management at the beginning of our fiscal year  the diversification of our products and customer base and successful marketing campaigns 
we have also taken steps to manage our business and our cost structure to respond to the market conditions 
on october   standard poor s raised our long and short term credit ratings to aa and a from a and a  respectively 
as fiscal year began  global markets continued to experience unprecedented volatility  and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future 
during october  the market pressures resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management  and accordingly  in our revenues and net income 
we expect to continue to focus on the investment performance of our sponsored investment products and to provide high quality customer service to our clients 
while we are focused on reducing costs  we will also seek to attract  retain and develop employees and invest in systems and technology that will provide secure  stable environments and economies of scale 
we will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker dealer and client relationships 
the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report  and other factors as discussed herein

operating income increased in fiscal year  consistent with a decrease in operating revenues and a decrease in operating expenses 
we experienced a period of sustained volatility in financial markets in fiscal nonetheless  our operating revenues remained stable 
in addition  we have taken steps to manage our business and our cost structure to respond to the market conditions 
net income decreased in fiscal year  primarily due to a decline in other income  net 
the decrease in other income  net reflects a decrease in investment and other income  net primarily due to lower realized gains on sale of investment securities  a decline in income from our investments in equity method investees  and lower interest and dividend income 
also contributing to the decrease in other income  net were net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products in fiscal year  as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in other income  net was partially offset by a increase in investment management fees 
diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year  consistent with the decrease in net income  partially offset by a decrease in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the company s repurchase of shares of our common stock 

table of contents net income increased in fiscal year primarily due to increased fees for providing investment management and fund administration services  reflecting a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  and a increase in other income  net primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments and higher gains from our consolidated sponsored investment products 
these increases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses 
diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year  consistent with the increase in net income and a decrease in diluted weighted average common stock outstanding 
diluted weighted average common stock outstanding was higher in the fiscal year ended september  the fiscal year than in fiscal year primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the conversion of liquid yield notes zero coupon convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock during fiscal year assets under management assets under management by investment objective were as follows dollar amounts in billions as of september  vs

the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuity products are not included 
for fiscal year  our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management decreased to from for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of assets under management from equity products towards fixed income products 
this change mainly resulted from depreciation and net new outflows of equity products  partially offset by net new inflows of fixed income products during fiscal year generally  investment management fees earned on equity products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products 
our effective investment management fee rate was for fiscal years and the effective investment management fee rate remained unchanged primarily due to a favorable change in the mix of assets under management  resulting from higher net new flows and greater appreciation for equity and hybrid products as compared to fixed income products  which was offset by a decrease in performance fees resulting from the divestiture of assets under management of a former subsidiary at october

investment management fees increased in fiscal year resulting from a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from equity products towards fixed income products  which generally carry lower investment management fees 
investment management fees increased in fiscal year consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a constant effective investment management fee rate 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans the plans under rule b promulgated under the investment company act of  as amended rule b 
the plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the plans limitations on amounts 
the individual plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us funds and where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 

table of contents overall  underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year underwriting fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross sales of class a shares  mainly in the united states  and a shift in sales of equity products to fixed income products  which typically generate lower underwriting fees 
distribution fees increased primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from equity products to fixed income products 
distribution fees are generally higher for equity products  as compared to fixed income products 
underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year underwriting fees increased primarily due to a increase in gross product sales  including product sales that do not generate underwriting and distribution revenues 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in equity products as compared to fixed income products in the simple monthly average mix of assets under management 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of assets under management 
we receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service  and tax reporting 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately million accounts closed in the us during calendar year were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  approximately thousand accounts closed in canada during calendar year were no longer billable effective may   as compared to approximately thousand accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal years and primarily due to and increases in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by an increase in shareholder accounts originated in asia that are billable at a lower rate 
consolidated sponsored investment products income  net consolidated sponsored investment products income  net reflects the net investment income  including dividend and interest income  of sponsored investment products that we consolidate in our financial statements 
consolidated sponsored investment products income  net increased in fiscal years and the increases reflect the investment performance and the net asset balances of the specific sponsored investment products that we consolidate each period 
other  net other  net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking finance operating segment as well as income from custody services 
revenues from the banking finance operating segment include interest income on loans  servicing income  and investment income on banking finance investment securities  including realized and unrealized gains losses on investments  and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses 

table of contents other  net revenue decreased in fiscal year primarily due to increased net realized and unrealized losses on investments and provisions for loan losses  partially offset by an increase in interest income from automobile loans 
other  net revenue increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher gains relating to securitizations of automobile loans  interest income on debt securities  and servicing fees from automobile loans  partially offset by a decrease in interest income related to our consumer lending business

underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions impairment of intangible assets other total operating expenses underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution expenses include payments to financial advisers and other third parties for providing sales  marketing and distribution services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
the decrease in underwriting and distribution expenses in fiscal year and increase in fiscal year are consistent with the changes in underwriting and distribution revenues during both periods 
underwriting and distribution expenses for fiscal year included a one time distribution charge of million related to the termination of certain limited partnerships in canada 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december  and higher staffing levels 
another contributing factor was an increase in bonus expense  primarily resulting from the impact of adopting financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  in october these increases were partially offset by a one time pre tax charge of million recorded in fiscal year and a decrease in costs related to matching contributions under our amended and restated employee stock investment plan 
compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in bonus expense  including bonus expense under the amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan the aip  pursuant to which bonus awards have been made  based  in part  on our performance 
the increase also reflected annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december  and higher staffing levels 
in fiscal year  we recorded additional expenses for the repurchase of stock based compensation awards that previously had been recognized as a charge to capital in excess of par value  and for certain employee costs incurred in a business combination that previously had been recognized as 
table of contents goodwill  partially offset by a reduction to expenses for a previously unrecognized receivable for the estimated refundable portion of workers compensation premiums 
the impact of these adjustments resulted in an additional non cash charge of million pre tax to compensation and benefits in fiscal year we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue 
we employed approximately  people at september   as compared to approximately  at september  information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased slightly in fiscal year primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices as well as global expansion 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in external data services costs and technology consulting costs 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in external data services costs  technology supplies and software  and higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices worldwide as well as global expansion 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs  which exclude occupancy costs  are shown below 
in millions for the fiscal years ended september  net carrying amount at beginning of period additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments amortization during period net carrying amount at end of period advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to decreased printing and global media advertising and promotion costs 
advertising and promotion expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in marketing support payments made to intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf in the united states 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities  which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly  or decrease more slowly  than our revenues 
in addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns  advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes sold globally  including class c and class r shares marketed in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
in addition  certain share classes  such as 
table of contents class a shares sold in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
we defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution and service fee revenues and contingent sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares 
we evaluate dca for recoverability on a periodic basis using undiscounted expected cash flows from the shares of mutual funds sold without a front end sales charge 
the us funds that had offered class b shares and carried a deferred sales charge arrangement ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders at the end of fiscal year existing class b shareholders may continue to exchange shares into class b shares of different funds and they may also continue to reinvest dividends on class b shares in additional class b shares 
historically  class b and certain of our class c deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations have been financed through sales of related future revenue or other arrangements with lightning finance company limited lfl  a company registered in ireland in which we hold a ownership interest 
in december  lfl transferred substantially all of its rights to this future revenue to lightning asset finance limited lafl  an irish special purpose vehicle formed for this sole purpose  in which we also hold a ownership interest 
the holder of the ownership interests in both lfl and lafl is a subsidiary of an international banking institution which is not affiliated with the company 
as of december  our dca have been financed generally by an independent third party 
under the us financing arrangements  the funds contracted with our us distributor  which in turn contracted with lfl 
as a result of our significant interest in both lfl and lafl we continue to carry the dca generated in the united states on our consolidated balance sheets until these assets are amortized or sold by lafl 
neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the future revenue sold  and  therefore  the future revenue is not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries 
in contrast to the us arrangements  the arrangements outside the united states are  in most cases  direct agreements with our canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources in our consolidated financial statements 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal years and the increases were mainly due to higher product sales with up front commissions in fiscal year  primarily related to us and canadian funds 
impairment of intangible assets we completed our most recent annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended december  and we determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of october  we also believe  based on our october  impairment tests substantially completed to date  that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired as of september  in addition  no impairment loss in the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was recognized during fiscal year no impairment loss in the value of intangible assets subject to amortization was recognized during fiscal years and during the quarter ended march   fiduciary trust implemented a plan of reorganization designed to emphasize its distinct high net worth brand and to pursue further integration opportunities within franklin templeton investments for its institutional business line 
these changes to fiduciary trust s business required us to review the carrying value of acquired customer base intangible assets of fiduciary trust 
as a result of these changes  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to customer base definite lived intangible assets of fiduciary trust in the quarter ended march  
table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees  fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  corporate travel and entertainment  and other miscellaneous expenses 
other operating expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to litigation costs incurred in the prior year and lower consulting and professional fees 
other operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher litigation costs  fund administration services fees payable to external parties and consulting and professional fees  including additional costs related to the distribution of market timing settlements 
other income expenses other income expenses includes net realized and unrealized investment gains losses on consolidated sponsored investment products  investment and other income  net and interest expense from our investment management and related services business 
investment and other income  net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments  including interest and dividend income  realized gains and losses on sale of available for sale investment securities  income from equity method investees  and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products  driven mainly by market value declines in equity products  as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year 
net realized gains on sale of investment securities  available for sale  income from equity method investees  and interest and dividend income also declined primarily due to unfavorable market conditions 
other income expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher realized gains on sale of investment securities  available for sale  gains on our consolidated sponsored investment products and income from equity method investees 
taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income primarily from our investment management and related services business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing us federal and state income tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an income tax charge related to repatriated earnings of our non us subsidiaries and our mix of foreign earnings 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a fiscal year income tax charge of million related to repatriated earnings of our non us subsidiaries under the jobs act  partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities in certain us state and local tax jurisdictions the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non us earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
on october   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies 
table of contents the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of fin resulted in a net decrease to beginning retained earnings of million  which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  with a corresponding million increase to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  a million increase to accrued expenses for interest and penalties  and a million increase to deferred tax assets 
as of september   the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million 
if recognized  substantially all of this amount  net of any deferred tax benefits  would favorably affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
during september  we amended our repatriation plan for undistributed foreign earnings to include repatriation to the us of the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our united kingdom consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of the amendment  we recognized a provision for us income taxes of million and a net deferred income tax liability of million in relation to million of accumulated and current earnings from the united kingdom  of which million was repatriated as of september  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity  capital resources and uses of capital in millions as of and for the fiscal years ended september  balance sheet data assets liquid assets cash and cash equivalents liabilities debt commercial paper medium term notes variable funding notes federal home loan bank advances other long term debt total debt cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  current receivables  and current investments trading  available for sale and other 
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  demand deposits with banks  federal funds sold  time deposits and debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments  including money market funds  which are readily convertible into cash 
cash and cash equivalents at september  decreased primarily due to a million increase in net cash used in investing activities and a million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
at september   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our us and non us operations were approximately and  as compared to approximately and at september  the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our us operations decreased primarily due to the repayment of medium term notes as discussed below under uses of capital 

table of contents the decrease in total debt outstanding during fiscal year primarily relates to repayments of medium term notes and variable funding notes  and amortization of other long term debt  partially offset by new federal home loan bank advances and commercial paper issuances 
we experienced a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in trading securities and a decrease in proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale  partially offset by lower originations of loans held for sale 
net cash outflows in investing activities were primarily due to purchases of investments exceeding liquidations 
net cash used in financing activities was slightly lower in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in minority interest cash receipts in our consolidated sponsored investment products and bank deposits  partially offset by higher payments on debt in excess of proceeds and an increase in common stock repurchases 
capital resources notwithstanding current market credit and liquidity conditions  we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  and the securitization of a portion of receivables from consumer lending activities 
at september   our current debt included commercial paper with a total face value of million that was issued at a weighted average annualized interest rate of and matured in october the banking finance operating segment finances its automobile lending business primarily through securitizations  federal home loan bank advances and the issuance of variable funding notes under one year revolving variable funding note warehouse credit facilities 
as of september  and  we had million and million available under these facilities 
in november  we terminated a million facility 
the remaining million facility expires later in november  we do not intend to renew or replace this facility upon expiration 
the variable funding notes issued under these facilities are payable to certain administered conduits and are secured by cash and a pool of automobile loans that meet or are expected to meet certain eligibility requirements 
credit enhancements for the variable funding notes require us to provide  as collateral  loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the principal amount of the variable funding notes  as well as provide payment provider commitments in an amount not to exceed of the pool balances 
at september  and  we held million and million of cash balances in trust to fulfill our payment provider obligations and recorded these balances as other banking finance assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements  accounted for as freestanding derivatives  intended to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the variable funding notes 
on june   we completed a securitization transaction of automobile loans with a carrying amount of loans sold of approximately million for net sale proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay the variable funding notes 
at september   our banking finance operating segment had million of total outstanding advances from the federal home loan bank 
approximately million of these advances mature in fiscal year  while the remaining million mature during the fiscal years to these advances had a weighted average interest rate of at september  and are subject to collateralization requirements 

table of contents at september   we had million in short term revolving credit available under a five year credit agreement with certain banks and financial institutions expiring on june   million of short term commercial paper remaining available for issuance under an uncommitted million private placement program  and million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit 
the agreement relating to the revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
in addition  at september   our banking finance segment had million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the federal reserve funds system  million available in secured federal reserve bank short term discount window and million available in secured federal home loan bank short term borrowing capacity 
in march  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec as a well known seasoned issuer 
using the shelf registration statement  we may sell  at any time and from time to time  in one or more offerings  our shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock  debt securities  convertible securities  warrants or units 
in october  the fdic announced a temporary liquidity guarantee program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system 
the program  the terms of which are still subject to change  is designed to guarantee certain forms of newly issued senior unsecured debt  up to of the amounts outstanding as of september  that were scheduled to mature before june  the program is also designed to provide full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts in fdic insured banks until december  we are eligible to participate in the program and are currently evaluating whether to participate or opt out by the deadline of december  our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted 
uses of capital we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt 
we repaid our five year senior notes due april  totaling million at maturity using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and available cash on hand 
these medium term notes carried an interest rate of and were not redeemable prior to maturity by either the note holders or us 
interest payments were due semi annually 
we continue to look for opportunities to control our costs and expand our global presence 
in this regard  in fiscal year  we entered into a commitment to acquire land and build a campus in hyderabad  india  to establish support services for several of our global functions 
our estimated total cost to complete the campus at september  was approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of this date 
we inaugurated the opening of the campus in january and expect to complete the construction of an additional building in fiscal year on september   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on october  to stockholders of record on october  we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
during fiscal year 
table of contents  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of  million 
the common stock repurchases made as of september  reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings 
at september   approximately million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program 
our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments 
we believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities 
in millions as of september  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years non current debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations loan origination commitments capital contribution commitments total contractual obligations and commitments operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling million 
purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees 
capital contribution commitments relate to our agreements to fund certain of our sponsored investment products 
the table excludes future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits 
as of september   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and approximately million of accrued interest see note taxes on income to our consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september   cannot be made 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are million and million 
contingent obligations in relation to the automobile loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities  we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was million and the fair value of obligations arising from automobile securitization transactions reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at september  were not significant 
at september   the banking finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking 
table of contents customers 
these standby letters of credit were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of million at september  off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above  we hold a ownership interest in lfl and lafl and we account for the ownership interest in these companies using the equity method of accounting 
as of september   lfl had approximately million in total assets and our exposure to loss related to lfl was limited to the carrying value of our investment totaling approximately million 
as of september   lafl had approximately million in total assets and our maximum exposure to loss related to lafl totaled approximately million 
we recognized pre tax losses of approximately million and pre tax income of million for our share of lfl s and lafl s net losses and income in fiscal years and due to our significant interest in lafl  we continue to carry on our balance sheet the dca and the related liability for the future revenue originally sold to lfl and transferred to lafl until these assets are amortized or sold by lafl 
neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the future revenue sold  and  therefore  the future revenue is not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries 
as discussed above  our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors see note securitization of loans held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for automobile loan activities

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  please refer to note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas also requires indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
we perform annual impairment tests in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections and models similar to those employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections to be derived from these assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we test definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization  we use valuation techniques based on undiscounted cash flow projections  without interest charges  to be derived from these assets 
in performing our impairment analyses  we use certain assumptions and estimates  including those related to assets under management growth rates  investor attrition rates  discount rates  and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets  based on  among other factors  historical trends and the characteristics of the assets 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
income taxes income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities  computed pursuant to fin and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon 
table of contents settlement 
we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses 
as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states and generate earnings from our non us subsidiaries 
we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries  except for subpart f income taxed in the us  subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions  and the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our canadian and united kingdom consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not recognized a provision for us income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september  changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of investments the company records substantially all of its investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
the fair value of investments in securities generally is determined using quoted market prices  or independent broker or dealer price quotes 
however  even where the fair value of a security is derived from independent broker or dealer price quotes  a valuation adjustment for certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for investments in illiquid securities  privately held securities  and certain retained interests in securitized assets  the company estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow models using relevant assumptions based on observable market or independently sourced market information  and internal data 
investments are evaluated for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
the company considers many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost  the intent and ability of the company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when a decline in fair value of an available for sale security is determined to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount 
see also note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation of variable interest entities we are required to consolidate a variable interest entity vie in which we are considered the primary beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment 
table of contents holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
fin r requires consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
we evaluate whether entities are vies and determine if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these vies 
these evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of vies  we utilize expected cash flow scenarios that include discount rate and volatility assumptions that are based on available historical information and management s estimates 
based on our evaluation  we believe we were not the primary beneficiary of vies and  as a result  did not consolidate these entities as of and for the year ended september  while we believe that our evaluation was appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments  and assumptions may affect whether certain related entities require consolidation in our financial statements under fin r

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk  including  but not limited to  potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
financial instruments include  but are not limited to  investment securities  deposits and debt obligations 
management is responsible for managing market risk 
our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
global markets have continued to experience unprecedented volatility  and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future 
market conditions have resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management  which directly impacts our revenues and net income 
a continued economic downturn and volatility in the global financial markets could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through our loans receivable  investment in debt securities  deposit liabilities  variable funding notes and other outstanding debt 
we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources and  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio and variable funding note liabilities 
we minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
in addition  we seek to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
at september   we have considered the potential impact of a movement in market interest rates on interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities  total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations  for each of these categories or in the aggregate 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the united states  we also provide services and earn revenues in the bahamas  asia pacific  canada and europe 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase 
we are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and investments held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate  which are also carried at fair value 
to mitigate these risks  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and  from time to time  we may enter into derivative agreements 
our exposure to market valuation risks is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions  which allows us to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market s or region s
