we sell our products and support services through our direct sales force and approximately distribution partners  including many of the largest networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
we maintain sales offices in burlington  massachusetts  madrid  spain and tokyo  japan 
we also have sales personnel in argentina  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  croatia  france  germany  hong kong  italy  korea  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  peru  russia  south africa  thailand and the united kingdom and throughout the united states 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the united states and internationally to provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
initial public offering in october  we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock in which we sold and issued million shares of our common stock  including million shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into million shares of common stock 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on december reference to  for example  refers to the fiscal year ended december  revenue we derive product revenue from the sale of our net net hardware and the licensing of our net net software 
we generally recognize product revenue at the time of product delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
for arrangements that include customer acceptance or other material non standard terms  we defer revenue recognition until after delivery  and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we generate maintenance  support and service revenue from a maintenance associated with software licenses  b technical support services for our product software  c hardware repair and maintenance services  d implementation  training and consulting services  and e reimbursable travel and other out of pocket expenses paid to us by our customers 
we offer our products and services indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
our distribution partners include networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our distribution partners generally purchase our products after they have received a purchase order from their customers and do not maintain an inventory of our products in anticipation of sales to their customers 
generally  the pricing offered to our distribution partners will be lower than to our direct customers 
the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the price for each sbc sold 
customers can purchase our sbcs in either a standalone or high availability configuration and can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
as the market continues to develop and grow  we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products and services 
we believe that our revenue and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of long sales and deployment cycles  variations in customer ordering patterns  and the application of complex revenue recognition rules to certain transactions 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses under which we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet specified performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue primarily consists of payments to third party manufacturers for purchased materials and services  salaries and benefits related to personnel  provision for inventory obsolescence  and related overhead 
cost of maintenance  support and service revenue consists primarily of a salaries and benefits related to professional services and technical support personnel  b billable and non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket expenses  c related overhead  and d contract manufacturer services for repairs and warranty services 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends in part on the mix of product configurations sold  c new product introductions  d the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  and e the volume and costs of manufacturing of our hardware products 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
during the period from december  through december   we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by from to we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows  and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as expense when earned by the employee 
we expect absolute dollar increases in sales and marketing expense for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities with the intent to grow our revenue 
however  we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
research and development expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c prototype and equipment costs relating to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products  d quality assurance and testing  and e other related overhead 
to date  all of our research and development expense has been expensed as incurred 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total revenue in the near term 
however  we anticipate that research and development expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries and personnel costs related to our executive  finance  human resource and information technology organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  and d other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur additional expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  investor relations expense  and higher insurance premiums 
however  we anticipate that general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
stock based compensation through december   cost of revenue and operating expenses included stock based compensation expense to the extent the fair value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant 
effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of shared based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded expense of million and  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards 
based on options granted in and  a future expense of non vested options of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
other income expense  net other income expense primarily consists of interest income earned on cash balances 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds 
other income expense also includes gains losses from foreign currency translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries 
the functional currency of our foreign operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the remeasurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income expense 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  as amended by sop  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
we have determined that the software element of our product is more than incidental to the products as a whole 
as a result  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we are required to recognize revenue under sop and sop in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenue until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when product has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
certain of our agreements contain products that might not conform to published specifications or contain a requirement to deliver additional elements which are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
revenue associated with these agreements is recognized when the customer specifications have been met or delivery of the additional elements has occurred 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is generated by multiple element arrangements  such as products  maintenance  professional services and training 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total fee among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
each arrangement requires us to analyze the individual elements in the transaction and to estimate the fair value of each undelivered element  which typically includes maintenance and services 
revenue is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
maintenance and support services include telephone support  return and repair services  and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements  and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period  which is generally months 
maintenance and support revenue generally is deferred until the related product has been accepted and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
professional services and training revenue is recognized as the related service is performed 
our products and services are distributed indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
revenue arrangements with distribution partners are recognized when the above criteria are met and only when we receive evidence that the distribution partner has an order from an end user customer 
we typically do not offer contractual rights of return  stock balancing or price protection to our distribution partners  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
as a result  we do not maintain reserves for product returns and related allowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any significant write offs of accounts receivable and have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  stock based compensation through december   we accounted for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is measured on the date of grant as the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the stock option exercise price or restricted stock award purchase price multiplied by the number of stock options or restricted stock awards granted 
generally  we granted stock based awards with exercise prices equal to the estimated fair value of its common stock  however  to the extent that the deemed fair value of the common stock exceeded the exercise or purchase price of stock based awards granted to employees on the date of grant  we amortized the expense over the vesting schedule of the awards  generally four years 
the fair value of our common stock for periods through december  was determined by our board of directors the board 
given the absence of a public market for our common stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering ipo  the fair value for our common stock was estimated by the board  with input from management 
the board exercised judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including the liquidation preferences  dividend rights and voting control attributable to our then outstanding convertible preferred stock and  primarily  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale of the company 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  the board considered objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
we believe this to have been a reasonable methodology based upon our internal peer company analyses and based on several arm s length transactions involving our common stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
on december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach under sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r starting on january  effective with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of stock options granted 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we will recognize the compensation cost of stock based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to october   the effective date of the our ipo  we determined the volatility for options granted in and based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies 
the expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
the risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas no 
permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas no 
as a result  we applied an estimated forfeiture rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the weighted average fair values of options granted were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the weighted average assumptions utilized to determine such values are presented in the following table year ended december  year ended december  risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life years years dividend yield we recorded stock based compensation expense of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
r  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
there were no stock based awards made to non employees in the years ended december   or inventory we recognize inventory losses based on obsolescence and levels in excess of forecasted demand 
in these cases  inventory is written down to estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 
to date  we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations 
when products have been delivered  but the product revenue associated with the arrangement has been deferred as a result of not meeting the revenue recognition criteria required by sop  we also defer the related inventory costs for the delivered items 
product warranties substantially all of our products are covered by a standard warranty of days for software and one year for hardware 
in the event of a failure of hardware or software covered by this warranty  we must repair or replace the hardware or software or  if those remedies are insufficient  provide a refund 
our customers typically purchase maintenance and support contracts  which encompass our warranty obligations 
our warranty reserve reflects estimated material and labor costs for potential or actual product issues in our installed base that are not covered under maintenance contracts  but for which we expect to incur an obligation 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
we periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty allowance and adjust the amount as necessary 
during the year ended december  we decreased our warranty allowance by  as a result of an analysis performed on historical data 
if the historical data we use to calculate the adequacy of the warranty allowance is not indicative of future requirements  additional or reduced warranty reserves may be required 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses whereby we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet certain performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
research and development expense for software products research and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual property 
the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we have determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of software is completed 
because we believe our current process for developing software will be essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
this process requires us to project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the year ended december   due to uncertainty surrounding the company s ability to utilize its remaining nol and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  we provided a full valuation allowance against our otherwise remaining recognizable deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   we utilized the remaining portion of our nol carryforwards to reduce income taxes currently payable and determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our remaining deferred tax assets 
therefore  we reduced the valuation allowance of million in december related to these deferred tax assets 
the benefit of the release of the valuation allowance was realized through a reduction of income tax expense 
as of december   we had state research and development tax credits of  that expire beginning in  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
during  we utilized all of our remaining us federal research and development tax credits 
the internal revenue code contains provisions that limit the nol and tax credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year in the event of certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests  as defined 
for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rates were   and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in and was due to the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating losses to offset its primary federal obligations 
our current intention is to reinvest the total amount of our unremitted earnings in the local jurisdiction or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective 
as such  we have not provided for us taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we adopted the provisions of fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at the adoption date and as of december   we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue year ended december  period to period change percentage of total revenue percentage of total revenue amount amount amount percentage dollars in thousands revenue by type product revenue    maintenance  support and service revenue   total revenue    revenue by geography united states and canada    international    total revenue    revenue by sales channel direct   indirect    total revenue    the million increase in product revenue was a result of an increase in the number of systems sold in which reflected the growth in the worldwide market for our products 
this growth was realized through our indirect sales channels 
indirect product revenues increased million  of which million was attributable to our international customers and million was attributable to our united states and canadian customers 
direct product revenues decreased million  of which million was attributable to united states and canadian customers partially offset by an increase of  from our international customers 
an increase in the average selling price of our systems due to changes in our product software configuration mix and an increase in the level of software license upgrades also contributed to the increase in product revenue in the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the price for each sbc sold 
customers can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity and a larger number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with lower software content 
the million increase in maintenance  support and service revenue was attributable primarily to the million increase in maintenance and support fees associated with the growth in our installed product base and a million increase in installation and training revenue  including reimbursable travel expenses

product gross margin increased by percentage point  reflecting the increase in the average selling price of our systems as a result of the changes in product configuration mix reflecting systems sales with a higher software content as noted above  as well as reduced costs per system paid to our contract manufacturers 
we expect our gross margin in the future to decrease  as we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products as the market for our products continues to develop and grow 
we cannot predict our ability to continue to realize reduced per system costs because we cannot predict the pricing of component parts or the volume of orders to be placed in the future 
gross margin on maintenance  support and service revenue increased by percentage points as a result of an increase in maintenance  support and service revenue associated with the growth in our installed product base without a corresponding increase in costs 
we expect cost of product revenue and cost of maintenance  support and service revenue each to increase at approximately the same rate as the related revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that gross profit on product revenue and gross profit on maintenance  support and service revenue will each increase  but that the related gross margin will decline slightly for the foreseeable future

we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars and to increase as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales force to continue to increase our revenue and market share 
however  we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term

the increase in research and development expense also reflected a an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  b an increase in depreciation expense of  associated with our investment in equipment to support new product development and c an increase of  for outside consulting services 
the addition of personnel and our continued investment in research and development were driven by our strategy of maintaining our competitive position by expanding our product offerings and enhancing our existing products to meet the requirements of our customers and market 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total revenue on the near term 
however  we anticipate that research and development expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
of the million increase in general and administrative expense  a  was attributable to higher salaries and benefits related to a increase in general and administrative headcount  b  was attributable to an increase in stock based compensation expense  c  was attributable to an increase in facilities costs  including rent  utilities and depreciation expense  associated with the overall increase in our employee headcount  d  was attributable to higher insurance premiums associated with being a publicly traded company and e  was attributable to increased legal  accounting and professional fees 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur additional expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  investor relations expense  and higher insurance premiums

the increase in interest income principally reflected higher average cash balances during  as a result of our initial public offering in october and cash provided by operating activities  as well as higher interest rates during other expense primarily consisted of foreign currency translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net benefit from income taxes in the amount of million 
the lower effective tax rate in was due to the utilization of previously unrecognized nols to offset our federal obligations 
we currently expect to realize recorded deferred tax assets as of december  of approximately million 
during  based on a number of factors  including recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies  we determined that in addition to the utilization of the remaining portion of our nol carryforwards to reduce taxable income in  it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our deferred tax assets  and therefore we reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million 
this benefit of the release in the valuation allowance was recognized through a reduction of income tax expense 
as a result  our effective tax rate for decreased to an effective tax benefit of 
our conclusion that such assets will be recovered is based upon taxable income previously recorded in the carryback period or our expectation that future earnings will provide sufficient taxable income to realize recorded tax assets 
while the realization of our net recorded deferred tax assets cannot be assured  to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient or carrybacks are eliminated  some or all of our net recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable 
approximately million of the deferred tax asset recorded as of december  is attributable to benefits associated with stock based compensation charges 
under the guidance of sfas no 
r  no valuation allowance has been recorded against this amount 
however  in the future  if the underlying awards expire with an intrinsic value less than the fair value of the awards on the date of grant  some or all of the benefit may not be realizable

product gross margin increased by percentage points  reflecting the increase in the average selling price of our systems as a result of the changes in product configuration mix reflecting systems sales with a higher software content as noted above  as well as reduced costs per system paid to our contract manufacturers 
the reduced cost per system paid to our contract manufacturer was attributable to the ability of our contract manufacturer to purchase components at a lower cost due to the increase in the volume of orders placed with our contract manufacturers as well as labor and overhead efficiencies realized as a result of increased manufacturing volume 
gross margin on maintenance  support and service revenue remained constant 
the increase in maintenance  support and service revenue associated with the growth in our installed product base was offset by a corresponding increase in costs

the increase in research and development expense also reflected an increase in depreciation expense of  associated with our investment in equipment to support new product development and an increase of  attributable to the effect of stock based compensation expense 
these factors were offset in part by a reduction in payments to suppliers for design and consulting services in the amount of  which reflected our decision to bring certain development activities in house as well as the timing of projects 
the addition of personnel and our continued investment in research and development were driven by our strategy of maintaining our competitive position by expanding our product offerings and enhancing our existing products to meet the requirements of our customers and market

the million increase in income from operations resulted from a million increase in gross profit  offset in part by a million increase in total operating expenses 
interest income  net consisted of interest income generated from the investment of our cash balances 
the increase in interest income principally reflected higher average cash balances during  as a result of our initial public offering in october and cash provided by operating activities  as well as higher interest rates during other expense primarily consisted of foreign currency translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net benefit from income taxes in the amount of million 
based on a number of factors  including recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies  we determined that in addition to the utilization of the remaining portion of our nol carryforwards to reduce taxable income in  it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our deferred tax assets  and therefore we reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million 
this benefit of the release in the valuation allowance was recognized through a reduction of income tax expense 
as a result  our effective tax rate for decreased to an effective tax benefit of 
liquidity and capital resources resources since  we have funded our operations principally with cash provided by operations  which has been driven by growth in revenue 
in october  we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock in which we sold and issued million shares of our common stock  including million shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
key measures of our liquidity are as follows as of and for the year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents    accounts receivable  net    working capital    cash provided by operating activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
restricted cash  which totaled   and  at december    and  respectively  and is not included in cash and cash equivalents  was held in certificates of deposit as collateral for letters of credit related to the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts and our sales office in madrid  spain 
accounts receivable  net 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our shipping and billing activity  cash collections  and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in some situations we receive cash payment from a customer prior to the time we are able to recognize revenue on a transaction 
we record these payments as deferred revenue  which has a positive effect on our accounts receivable balances 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by b days 
dso was days at december   days at december  and days at december  the increase in dso at december  was attributable to the higher level of revenue during the three months ended december  from our indirect partners and our international customers  which tend to have longer payment terms than our domestic and direct customers 
the timing of shipments during the three months ended december  was also a factor contributing to the increase in dso 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  the provision for bad debts  stock based compensation expense  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of million of net income  non cash adjustments of million consisting primarily of million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation expense  partially offset by million related to the tax savings to the company from the exercise  by employees  of stock options  partially offset by million used in working capital and other activities 
cash used in working capital and other activities primarily reflected a million increase in accounts receivable  reflecting an overall increase in activity and an increase in dso  partially offset by a decrease of million in inventory and a net increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of million of net income  negative non cash adjustments of  primarily deferred income taxes of million offset by depreciation and amortization of million   of stock based compensation expense  and  for provision for bad debts  and million used in working capital and other activities 
cash used in working capital and other activities primarily reflected a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  and a million increase in other assets  reflecting an overall increase in business activity  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a million increase in deferred revenue 
this increase in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue from our support service contracts  which will be recognized as revenue over the twelve month term of the support service period 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of a net loss of  and positive non cash adjustments of million primarily depreciation and amortization 
working capital and other activities remained flat during but the net activity consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased revenues in and a million increase in inventory to support the overall increase in business activity  offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
working capital also reflected a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from an increase in payments received from customers prior to the time revenue could be recognized and an increase in deferred support revenue which will be recognized as revenue over the term of the support periods 
equity financing activities 
as previously discussed  we completed an ipo of our common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received proceeds from the issuance of restricted common stock and exercises of common stock options  net of the amount paid for the repurchase of common stock  in the amounts of  in   in and  in in february  the board authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock over the subsequent twelve month period 
the purchase of our common stock will be executed periodically as market and business conditions warrant on the open market  in negotiated or block trades  or under a rule b plan  which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded for doing so under insider trading laws 
this common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount  or number of shares of common stock  and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
the common stock repurchase program will remain in effect through february  through march  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price  including applicable brokers fees  of million 
credit facility borrowings 
we previously maintained an equipment line of credit facility with a commercial bank under which we made borrowings of million in and this equipment line of credit expired in and was converted into a term loan which was repaid in additionally  during  and we maintained two lines of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of million 
we did not draw against these lines of credit and they expired unused in july based on information currently available to us  we believe that we will be able to enter into such an arrangement with a commercial bank on terms acceptable to us in the event we subsequently determine that such an arrangement is necessary or desirable to provide us with additional working capital 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new products and enhancements  and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
requirements capital expenditures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  substantially all of our international customer agreements have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of our foreign operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the remeasurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
if the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuated by as of december   our foreign exchange exposure would have fluctuated by less than  interest rate risk at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income
