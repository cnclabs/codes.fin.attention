item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ruby tuesday  inc rti  the company  we and or our owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
in june  we acquired one wok hay restaurant  an asian concept located in knoxville  tennessee 
as of fiscal year end  we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
we have a contractual right to acquire  at predetermined valuation formulas  the remaining equity of any or all of the franchise partnerships 
our other franchisees operated restaurants  including in international markets 
in total  our franchisees operate restaurants in states  puerto rico  guam  and foreign countries 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal was a week year 
fiscal years and each contained weeks 
in fiscal  the rd week added million to restaurant sales and operating revenue and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statement of income 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
three years ago  our analysis of the bar and grill sector of casual dining indicated that many of the concepts  including ruby tuesday  were not clearly differentiated and as the sector matures this lack of differentiation will make it increasingly difficult to attract new guests to all but the largest companies 
consequently  in response to this analysis  we developed brand strategies focusing on uncompromising freshness and quality high quality menu items  gracious hospitality guest service  and star facilities the look and atmosphere of our restaurants 
later we added compelling value to our strategic focus in response to the difficult operating and consumer environment 
our first priority was to improve our food with an emphasis on uncompromising freshness and quality 
our gracious hospitality initiative comprised upgrading our team selection  image  and performance standards 
in the last fiscal year  we reimaged more than company operated restaurants  creating a fresh  new  updated look for our restaurants and accomplishing our objective of having star facilities 
the reimaging program was essentially finished in the fourth quarter of fiscal  completing the strategic repositioning of our brand and putting us in position to deliver on our mission of delivering a memorable  high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
while we were in the process of implementing our brand strategies  consumer spending came under pressure for a variety of reasons and the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has experienced a difficult operating environment 
all of these factors have contributed to declines in same restaurant sales and our not meeting our targeted financial results for the last two years even though our measures of guest satisfaction have shown increases 
our same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants declined and our diluted earnings per share declined in fiscal throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail as well as provide insight for fiscal years and we hope our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance 
we remind you  that  in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we remain committed to increasing shareholder value and have set the following financial goals for fiscal and beyond get more from our existing restaurants 
our principal focus is to grow same restaurant sales same restaurants are defined as those that have been open at least months and average annual sales per restaurant  with long term targets of annual growth and million  respectively 
as shown later in this md a section  our average annual sales per restaurant for company owned restaurants was million in fiscal our first priority is to stabilize same restaurant sales and arrest the current decline 
to achieve this  we will continue to focus on our core brand strategies that appear to be successful in improving customer satisfaction 
we will also introduce the new ruby tuesday brand through a combination of media advertising and local marketing initiatives 
now that each element of the brand compliments the others  we believe we are in a position to more effectively communicate our changes to our guests 
if our execution of our brand strategies leads to success in maintaining our current customers and the advertising and marketing initiatives draw in new customers  we believe we can grow same restaurant sales and average annual restaurant volumes 
lower our costs 
we constantly strive to reduce our cost of doing business at both the corporate and restaurant levels without having a negative impact on quality or our guests experience 
generate free cash flow and improve our balance sheet 
because of our leverage  we are highly focused on maximizing our cash flow 
if we are successful in stabilizing same restaurant sales and maintaining or lowering our costs  we should generate substantial cash flow 
furthermore  our capital requirements are relatively modest as we anticipate only adding approximately four restaurants this year and our maintenance capital spending needs are low because we have remodeled virtually all the company owned restaurants within the last year 
we define free cash flow to be the net amount remaining when purchases of property and equipment are subtracted from net cash provided by operating activities 
we anticipate total capital spending in fiscal to be approximately million  down from million in fiscal we also estimate we will generate million of free cash flow in fiscal  a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to the reduction of debt 
similarly  free cash flow generated in the next few years following fiscal will also be used to reduce debt 
our objective is to reduce debt as quickly as possible to the point where the payment of dividends and share repurchases will no longer be restricted by our loan agreements 
we are also evaluating other ways we could reduce bank debt and strengthen our balance sheet 
results of operations ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned domestic franchise international franchise total during fiscal company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were opened or acquired  including purchased from our west palm beach  michigan  and detroit franchisees  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were closed  and aside from the restaurants sold to the company  nine domestic and five international franchise restaurants were opened and seven two domestic and five international were closed 
during fiscal company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were opened or acquired  including purchased from our orlando and south florida franchisees  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were sold or closed  including seven sold or leased to our st

other revenue information company restaurant sales in thousands company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue in thousands a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue in thousands total revenue growth percentage company same restaurant sales growth percentage company average restaurant volumes million million million company average restaurant volumes growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
our decrease in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in same restaurant sales and lower overall average restaurant volumes  which were partially offset by a net addition of restaurants since the prior year 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to reductions in customer counts  as there have been pressures on the consumer such as rising fuel prices  at a time concurrent with that of our move toward the higher end of casual dining 
we also believe that other factors contributing to the decline include the loss of some of our customers who do not feel as comfortable in our re imaged restaurants  the impact of heavy price focused advertising by some of our traditional competitors  and leveling of sales growth in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry resulting from the growth of supply outpacing that of demand 
our increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to the net growth in number of restaurants partially offset by a decrease in same restaurant sales and the addition of a rd week in the prior year 
during the year  we added a net of restaurants 
same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants decreased in fiscal the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to a leveling of sales growth in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry as new restaurant growth has outpaced demand  coupled with pressures on the consumer such as rising fuel prices and higher short term interest rates 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal and are due in part to the acquisition of certain franchise partnership entities in the respective fiscal years  temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees  and the addition of a rd week in fiscal total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants

other factors impacting the change in pre tax income include the impact of the rd week in fiscal  the loss from the specialty restaurant group  llc srg bankruptcy  and increased losses from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food and beverage costs as a result of offering higher quality menu items as part of our strategy to offer compelling value to our guests 
enhancements during the year include increasing the size of steak with the sirloin and jumbo lump crab cake entr e  adding salmon entr es to our menu  and offering promotions featuring ribs and seafood to our guests 
additionally  we utilized direct mail and freestanding insert coupons for various promotions throughout the year  with heaviest usage occurring in the second fiscal quarter 
these promotions had the impact of reducing our average food check and increasing the related food cost as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue 
wine cost also increased as we transitioned to higher grade premium wines 
cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food and beverage costs as a result of product enhancements including items rolled out as part of our fresh program  an increase in the french fry portion size  a higher quality garden bar  and transitioning to premium wines and liquors 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher hourly labor relating to the rollout of the quality service specialist program during the current year  minimum wage increases in several states during the current year  and higher management labor due to loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  remained consistent in fiscal with fiscal as increased wages were offset by favorable health claims experience 
wages increased in both the front and back of the house due to the addition of training manager positions in fiscal  increased spending on line cooks and food runners  as well as minimum wage increases in several states 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  primarily electricity  higher repairs due to increased maintenance contracts and equipment replacement costs  higher credit card expense due to recognition of income in the prior year resulting from a settlement with a credit card vendor  higher rent and lease required expenses due to the acquisition of three franchise partnerships during the year  an increase in asset impairment charges  and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  primarily electricity  higher supplies as a result of upgraded plateware  glassware  and to go containers  and higher building and equipment repairs 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased bad debt expenses associated with certain franchise notes receivable and decreased losses from the sale or impairment of certain properties 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to accelerated depreciation million for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative which had begun in the latter part of fiscal and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  remained consistent in fiscal with fiscal as the increase resulting from accelerated depreciation million for restaurants remodeled during was offset by reduced depreciation for older leased restaurants as initial leasehold improvements became fully depreciated 
loss from specialty restaurant group  llc bankruptcy srg  the company to whom we sold our american cafe and tia s tex mex restaurants concepts in fiscal  closed restaurants on january  as well as several others earlier in fiscal srg declared chapter bankruptcy on february   leading rti to record a pre tax charge of million during fiscal for leases for which we have primary liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the srg leases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher share based compensation expense due to expensing in fiscal of a restricted share grant awarded to a retirement eligible executive 
share based compensation expense increased million in fiscal to million  net of amounts capitalized 
additionally  advertising expense was higher due to utilizing a direct mail program in conjunction with the completion of re imaged restaurants 
support service  marketing and advertising fee income from franchisees  which is recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses  was lower due to the acquisitions of three franchise partnerships during the current year  temporarily reduced rates for certain franchise partnerships  and reduced requirements for our national advertising fund 
these increased expenses and reduced income amounts were partially offset by lower cable and television expense due to less air time 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher share based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
share based compensation expense increased million in fiscal to million  net of amounts capitalized 
this increase was partially offset by lower bonus expense 
equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchisees was million as compared to million in fiscal the change primarily resulted from an increase in losses from investments in certain of the franchise partnerships  due in part to same restaurant sales declines 
as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchisees was a million loss as compared to a million income in fiscal the change was primarily due to the acquisition of the orlando franchise in the first quarter of fiscal  coupled with increased losses associated with certain owned franchises due in part to same restaurant sales declines of certain franchisees  primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter  coupled with higher interest expense due to increased debt associated with new restaurant openings and restaurant acquisitions from rti and higher hourly labor costs as a result of minimum wage increases 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our share repurchase program and the timing of repurchases in the prior year 
in addition  the increase is attributable to the acquisition of three franchise entities during the current fiscal year  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional assumed debt  and higher rates in the latter part of the year on certain of our restructured debt as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section following 
net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our share repurchase program 
in addition  the increase is attributable to the acquisition of two franchise entities during fiscal  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional assumed debt 
benefit provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily a result of the impact of tax credits  which remained consistent or increased  while taxable income decreased  and the tax impact of settlements of audits and expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to higher tax credits partially as a result of increased work opportunity tax credits 
these credits coupled with lower pre tax income resulted in our already increased tax credits having a greater impact on the overall tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity previously allowed us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we had established certain priorities for our operating cash flow invest with a focus on getting more from existing assets  invest wisely and prudently in new restaurants with a focus on achieving average restaurant volumes on new restaurants of million or more  continue to make investments in our team members in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction  and repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend program  started in fiscal in fiscal  in part reflecting an overall slowdown in consumer spending  our sales and operating cash flow declined and we renegotiated certain of our loan agreements 
as discussed in more detail below  these revised loan agreements place restrictions on the use of our free cash flow  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and require us to reduce our outstanding indebtedness with our excess free cash flow 
accordingly  going forward  our cash from operations will be principally used to reduce debt and to pursue our revised targeted capital structure 
sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and short term investments operating activities cash provided by operating activities in fiscal decreased to million due to lower net income and changes in net operating assets  primarily reductions in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  offset by higher depreciation expense 
the reduction in cash associated with changes in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities is attributable to a decrease in accounts payable during fiscal compared to an increase in accounts payable in the prior year due in part to an accrual in the prior year for losses from the srg bankruptcy  and a decrease in insurance reserves in the current year due to settlement of a dram shop liability case 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily due to accelerated depreciation million for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative which had begun in the latter part of fiscal coupled with additional restaurants attributable to new restaurant openings and franchise acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in this decrease was driven by a decrease in net income coupled with changes in deferred income taxes 
these changes were partially offset by share based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r  an increase in depreciation and amortization  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset or debt reduction a long term liability and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
amounts reflected for fiscal included million for a company wide re image project which is discussed later in this md a 
in addition  during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of three franchise partnerships and certain assets from wok hay  llc 
these acquisitions added restaurants to the company 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchisees in the eastern united states  may occur either during fiscal or thereafter 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be approximately million based on our planned improvements for existing restaurants and our expectation that we will open approximately four company owned ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
financing activities during the past three fiscal years  we required capital to repurchase shares of our common stock and to pay dividends to our common shareholders 
cash used for share repurchases totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cash used for dividend payments during those same periods totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
as discussed further in the known events  uncertainties and trends section below  on january   our board of directors announced a plan of moving our semi annual dividend to an annual review for payment 
consequently  no dividend was paid in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of amendments to certain of our debt agreements  on may   as discussed below  we are restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing any shares until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness 
our current borrowings and credit facilities are summarized below 
on november   we entered into a five year revolving credit agreement the credit facility under which we could borrow up to million for general corporate purposes 
on february   we entered into an amendment and restatement of the credit facility such that the aggregate amount we could borrow increased to million 
this amount included a million subcommitment for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million subcommitment for swingline loans 
due to concerns that at some point in the future we might not have been in compliance with the ratios required in the original agreement  we entered into an amendment of the credit facility on november  to amend the minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt ratios through the fiscal quarter ending june  and thereafter 
as reported in our form q for the fiscal quarter ended march   due to concerns that  at some point during the next twelve months  our maximum funded debt ratio might have exceeded  and our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio might have been below  the threshold levels established under the november  amended covenants  we obtained waivers of these possible debt covenants and continued working for more favorable amendments of the debt 
on may   we entered into a second amendment and restatement of the credit facility 
following the may  amendment to the credit facility  our original million capacity was reduced by million to million due to regularly scheduled quarterly amortization and other reductions 
we expect the capacity of the credit facility to be further reduced by an estimated million in fiscal due to a series of scheduled quarterly and other required reductions 
under the amended and restated credit facility  interest rates charged on borrowings can vary depending on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or an adjusted libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin is zero to for the base rate loans and a percentage ranging from to for the libo rate based option 
we pay commitment fees quarterly ranging from to on the unused portion of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we had borrowings of million with an associated floating rate of interest of at june  as of june   we had million outstanding with an associated floating rate of interest of 
after consideration of letters of credit outstanding  we had million available under the credit facility as of june  the credit facility will mature on february  on april   we issued notes totaling million through a private placement of debt the private placement 
the private placement initially consisted of million in notes with a fixed interest rate of the series a notes and million in notes with a fixed interest rate of the series b notes 
the series a and b notes mature on april  and april   respectively 
given similar circumstances as those with the credit facility discussed above  we entered into amendments of the notes issued in the private placement on both november  and on may under the original terms of the private placement  we were not required to make principal payments on either the series a or b notes prior to their respective maturity dates 
under the terms of the may  amended and restated agreement  we are required to offer scheduled prepayments of principal on the series a and b notes prior to their respective maturity dates 
during the fourth quarter of  we offered  and our noteholders accepted  principal prepayments of million and million on the series a and b notes  respectively 
accordingly  at june   the balances outstanding under the private placement consisted of million for the series a notes and million for the series b notes 
we estimate that we will offer prepayments totaling million during fiscal and have classified that amount as current 
the million includes four quarterly offers of million each  two required offers of million each  and an additional amount to be determined based upon excess cash flows as defined in the amendment and restatement to the private placement 
following the amendment and restatement of the notes issued under the private placement  the interest rates associated with the series a and b notes increased to and  respectively 
the may  amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the notes issued in the private placement eased financial covenants regarding minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum funded debt ratio 
we are currently in compliance with our debt covenants 
in exchange for the new covenant requirements  in addition to higher interest rate spreads and mandatory prepayments of principal as previously discussed  the amendments also imposed restrictions on future capital expenditures and require us to achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters before we may pay dividends or repurchase any of our stock 
during fiscal  we expect to fund operations  capital expansion  and any purchase of franchise partnership equity  from operating cash flows  our credit facility  and operating leases 
repurchases of common stock and or payment of dividends  if allowed  would be similarly funded 
share repurchases from time to time our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock as a means to return excess capital to our shareholders 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of the purchases can be made at the discretion of management  depending upon market conditions and the restrictions contained in our loan agreements 
during fiscal we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares 
although million shares remained available for purchase under existing programs at june   our loan agreements  as amended in fiscal  prohibit the repurchase of our common stock until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a revolving credit facility a unsecured senior notes series a and b a interest b operating leases c purchase obligations d pension obligations e total f a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
b amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed rate debt instruments 
interest payments on our variable rate revolving credit facility and variable rate notes payable with balances of million and million  respectively  as of june  have been excluded from the amounts shown above  primarily because the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility  described further in note of the consolidated financial statements  fluctuates daily 
additionally  the amounts shown above include interest payments on the series a and b notes at the current interest rates of and  respectively 
these rates could be different in the future based upon certain leverage ratios 
c this amount includes operating leases totaling million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected 
certain of these leases obligate us to pay maintenance costs  utilities  real estate taxes  and insurance  which are excluded from the amounts shown above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
d the amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies  construction projects  and other miscellaneous commitments 
e see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
f this amount excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits under financial accounting standards board interpretation no

fin due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations 
commercial commitments were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years letters of credit a franchise loan guarantees a divestiture guarantees total a includes a million letter of credit which secures franchisees borrowings for construction of restaurants being financed under a franchise loan facility 
the franchise loan guarantees totaling million also shown in the table exclude the guarantee of million for construction to date on the restaurants being financed under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
off balance sheet arrangements franchise partnership guarantees as part of the franchise partnership program  we have negotiated with various lenders a million credit facility to assist the franchise partnerships with working capital needs and cash flows from operations the franchise facility 
as sponsor of the franchise facility  we serve as partial guarantor  and in certain circumstances full guarantor  of the draws made by the franchise partnerships on the franchise facility 
although the franchise facility allows for individual franchise partnership loan commitments to the end of the franchise facility term  all current commitments are for months 
the franchise facility expires on october  the franchise facility contains various restrictions  including limitations on additional debt  the payment of dividends and limitations regarding maximum funded debt  minimum net worth  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios 
on may   concurrent with amendments of the credit facility and the notes issued in the private placement  we entered into an amendment of the franchise facility 
among other changes  this amendment changed both the minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt ratios 
the amount guaranteed under this program totaled million as of june  as consideration for providing this guaranty  we received million in fiscal and million in fiscal prior to july   we had an arrangement with a third party lender whereby we could choose  in our sole discretion  to partially guarantee specific loans for new franchisee restaurant development the cancelled facility 
on july   we terminated the cancelled facility and notified this third party lender that we would no longer enter into additional guarantee arrangements 
we will honor the partial guarantees of the remaining two loans to franchise partnerships that were in existence as of the termination of the credit facility 
should payments be required under the cancelled facility  we have certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
this program had remaining outstanding guarantees of million at june  also in july  we entered into a new program  similar to the cancelled facility  with a different third party lender the franchise development facility 
the franchise development facility expired on july   although the guarantees outstanding at that time survived the expiration of the arrangement 
we had a guarantee of million outstanding under this program as of june  divestiture guarantees on november   we completed the sale of all of our american cafe including l n seafood and tia s tex mex tia s restaurants to specialty restaurant group  llc srg  a limited liability company 
a number of these restaurants were located on leased properties 
we remain primarily liable on certain american cafe and tia s leases that were subleased to srg and contingently liable on others 
srg  on december   sold its tia s restaurants to an unrelated entity and  as part of the transaction  further subleased certain tia s properties 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the third party owner to whom srg had sold the tia s restaurants declared chapter bankruptcy 
this declaration left us and or srg either primarily or indirectly liable for certain of the older tia s leases 
as of june   rti has settled almost all of the tia s leases 
future payments to the remaining landlords are expected to be insignificant 
on january   srg closed of its restaurants  of which were located on properties sub leased from rti 
four other srg restaurants were closed in calendar srg filed for chapter bankruptcy on february  following the closing of the srg restaurants in january  we performed an analysis of the now closed properties in order to estimate the lease liability to be incurred from the closings 
based upon the analysis performed  a charge of million was recorded during fiscal an additional charge of million was recorded during fiscal as of june   rti remains primarily liable for five srg leases which cover closed restaurants 
scheduled cash payments for rent remaining on these five leases at june  totaled million 
because many of these restaurants were located in malls  we may be liable for other charges such as common area maintenance and property taxes 
in addition to the scheduled remaining payments  we believe an additional million for previously scheduled rent and related payments on these leases had not been paid as of june  as of june    rti has recorded an estimated liability of million based on the five srg unsettled claims to date 
three leases  which  at june   comprised million of the lease liability reserve  were settled in fiscal at a total cost of million 
a fourth lease was resolved during fiscal due to lease expiration 
an additional million was paid on currently unresolved leases during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted below  during fiscal  our shareholders approved the distribution the distribution of our family dining restaurant business  then called morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc  and our health care food and nutrition services business  then called morrison health care  inc mhc 
subsequently  piccadilly cafeterias  inc piccadilly acquired mfc and compass group  plc compass acquired mhc 
prior to the distribution  we entered into various guarantee agreements with both mfc and mhc  most of which have expired 
as agreed upon at the time of the distribution  we have been contingently liable for payments to mfc and mhc employees retiring under a mfc s and mhc s versions of the management retirement plan and the executive supplemental pension plan the two non qualified defined benefit plans for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of march  and b funding obligations under the morrison retirement plan the retirement plan maintained collectively by us  mfc  and mhc following the distribution the qualified plan until  and payments due on certain workers compensation claims 
on october   piccadilly filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court in fort lauderdale  florida 
in addition  on march   piccadilly withdrew as a sponsor of the retirement plan with the approval of the bankruptcy court 
because we and mhc were  at the time  the remaining sponsors of the retirement plan  both rti and mhc were jointly and severally required to make contributions to the retirement plan  or any successor plan  in such amounts as were necessary to satisfy all benefit obligations under the retirement plan 
assets and obligations attributable to mhc participants  as well as the participants formerly with mfc  who were allocated to compass following the bankruptcy  were spun out of the retirement plan effective june  following compass s withdrawal  we remained the sole sponsor of the retirement plan 
as of june   we have received partial settlements of the piccadilly bankruptcy totaling million to date 
we hope to recover further amounts upon final settlement of the bankruptcy  although further payments  if any  are expected to be insignificant 
the actual amount we may be ultimately required to pay towards the divestiture guarantees could be lower if there is any further recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding  or could be higher if more valid participants are identified or if actuarial assumptions are proven inaccurate 
we estimated our divestiture guarantees related to mhc at june  to be million for employee benefit plans 
in addition  we remain contingently liable for mhc s portion estimated to be million of the mfc employee benefit plan liability for which mhc is currently responsible under the divestiture guarantee agreements 
we believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for mhc s portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of mhc and compass 
employment agreement we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until july  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option and restricted stock grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of an involuntary termination without cause and certain types of voluntary resignation  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of june   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
as required by sfas r  share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one quarter shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows 
of these restaurants  nine are recorded at salvage value 
we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the other restaurants and concluded that impairments existed at certain of them 
impairment charges of million were recorded during fiscal for restaurants open as of june  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
in addition to the above  impairments totaling million were recorded during fiscal on non operating assets  including those classified as held for sale in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
our goodwill  which totaled million at june   is not amortized 
we perform tests for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use  estimates of sales proceeds and other measures  such as fair market price of our common stock  as evidenced by closing trading price 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if market conditions at either the restaurant store level or system wide deteriorate  or if operating results decline unexpectedly  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
franchise accounting equity method accounting as of june   we were the franchisor of franchise partnership ruby tuesday restaurants and traditional domestic and international franchised restaurants 
based on an analysis prepared using financial information obtained  when necessary  from the franchise entities  we concluded that  for all periods presented  we were not required to consolidate any of the franchise entities under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
this conclusion was based on our determination that the franchise entities met the criteria to be considered businesses  and therefore were not subject to consolidation due to the business scope exception of fin r 
we apply the equity method of accounting to our six owned franchise partnerships 
accordingly  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the franchise partnerships in the consolidated statements of income when reported by those franchisees 
the cost method of accounting is applied to all owned franchise partnerships 
revenue recognition we charge our franchise partnerships various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and a advertising fee 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise partnership with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
at june  the allowance for doubtful notes was million  substantially all of which is allocated to the million of debt due from seven franchisees that  for the most recent reporting period  have either reported coverage ratios below the required levels with certain of their third party debt  or reported ratios above the required levels but for an insufficient amount of time 
with the exception of amounts borrowed under one current and two former credit facilities for franchise partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information  the third party debt referred to above is not guaranteed by rti 
we believe that payments are being made by these franchisees in accordance with the terms of these debts 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures in accordance with fin we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability

our plans currently have measurement dates that do not coincide with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we will be required to change their measurement dates in fiscal the impact of the transition  including the net periodic benefit cost computed for the period between our previous measurement dates and our fiscal year end  as well as changes in the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations  will be recorded directly to shareholders equity on june  we expect the adoption of this requirement to result in a one time charge to retained earnings of approximately million

known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and maintaining the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy has periodically allowed us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is approximately million 
this amount reflects repurchase authorizations of million and million shares approved by our board of directors on january  and july   respectively 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings 
however  as previously discussed  under the terms of the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the private placement  we may not engage in the repurchase of our stock until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
re image progress as discussed in previous filings  in an effort to continue moving our brand towards a high quality casual dining restaurant and away from the traditional bar and grill category  we have changed our look and feel  in order to differentiate ourselves with a more contemporary and fresher look 
as of june   we have completed the re imaging of company owned restaurants 
we completed the re imaging of additional restaurants prior to the date of this filing 
we do not plan to re image the remaining company owned restaurants 
capital expenditures to date  excluding the costs to accelerate depreciation or write off existing assets  totaled million  of which million was spent in fiscal dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
a per share dividend  which totaled million  was paid on august   to shareholders of record on july  on january   the board of directors announced a plan of moving our semi annual dividend to an annual payment  and thus no dividend was paid during fiscal s third quarter 
as noted above  following the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the private placement we may not pay a dividend until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
franchising and development agreements our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for a specified price 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during fiscal and  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships 
we currently have a ownership in seven of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june  our franchise agreements with the franchise partnerships allow us to purchase all remaining equity interests beyond the or we already own  for an amount to be calculated based upon a predetermined valuation formula 
during fiscal  we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt west palm beach franchise  lp  rt michigan franchise  llc  and rt detroit franchise  llc  bringing our equity interest in these franchises to 
at the time of the acquisitions  the franchisees operated   and ruby tuesday restaurants  respectively 
to the extent allowable under our debt facilities  we may choose to sell existing restaurants or exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on june  fiscal year and contained weeks  while fiscal year contained weeks 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin for the libo rate based option is a percentage ranging from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
