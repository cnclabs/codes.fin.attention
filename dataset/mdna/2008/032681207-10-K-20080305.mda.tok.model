item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview of events headquartered in minneapolis  minnesota  analysts international is a diversified it services company 
in business since  we have sales and customer support offices in the united states and canada 
we offer our clients a full range of it consulting services  including staffing serving large  high volume  accounts  our staffing services are focused on providing reasonably priced resources to volume buyers on demand  professional services serving mid market clients in targeted geographic regions  our professional services are designed to provide professional resources such as developers  project managers  business analysts and other highly skilled resources that can assist our clients in achieving their business objectives  and solutions providing network services  infrastructure  application integration  ip telephony and hardware solutions to mid market clients 
early in  we experienced a significant decline in the number of our billable technical staff 
although we made some progress during in regaining a portion of this lost headcount  by the end of the year we had not returned to beginning of year levels 
during  we continued to experience significant growth in our relationship with cisco 
this relationship is centered around cisco ip communications products and was the primary reason our product sales grew by from to on february   jeffrey p 
baker  our former president and chief executive officer  tendered his resignation to our board of directors 
his employment terminated on may  on february   the board of directors accepted mr 
baker s resignation and appointed michael j 
lavelle  then chairman of the board  to serve as our interim president and chief executive officer until a replacement for mr 
baker was found 
on november   the board of directors appointed elmer n 
baldwin to serve as our president and chief executive officer 
on january  we announced our new strategic plan the plan  designed to restore the company to profitability and increase shareholder value 
this plan is the result of four months of assessment of the company and was developed under the direction of mr 
baldwin  and was approved by the board of directors in december the objectives of the plan include i increasing revenue  improving margins and adding sales and recruiting personnel in higher margin businesses  ii expanding our value added services in key metro markets  and iii reducing corporate expenses through consolidation of back office and other corporate overhead functions 
future key initiatives are expected to include exiting non strategic  non core lines of business and increasing the efficiency of our operations through continuous process and productivity improvements 
as part of the plan  in we intend to expand our solutions business by launching project oriented it consulting practices in our most attractive us markets 
in  we plan to continue our expansion in additional markets throughout the us 
in  as described in greater detail in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of changes in our senior leadership and the adoption of our plan and other factors  the company recorded special charges totaling million for severance costs   for lease restructure  and million related to the write off of goodwill associated with our staffing and solutions reporting units  million related to the write off of other intangible and long lived assets  and million related to establishing a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax assets 
market conditions and economics of our business competitive conditions in the it services industry continue to present challenges for us 
we were successful in growing our business during by expanding our business of reselling it products 
we continue to experience intense competition in hiring billable technical personnel and intense pricing pressures from our largest clients 
during  as a result of these pressures  our direct services revenue declined from levels 
by focusing sales efforts we have increased the average bill rates at our existing clients 
we expect that demand for our services will increase in coming years  enabling us to increase our headcount 
our strategy is to acquire new mid market clients where we develop intimate client relationships based on the value we bring to their business 
doing so allows us to become less dependent on large national accounts 
as we accomplish this  we expect that our bill rates and margins will continue to improve 
our ability to quickly identify  attract and retain qualified technical personnel at competitive pay rates will affect our results of operations and our ability to grow in the future 
competition for the technical personnel needed to deliver the services we provide our clients has intensified in recent years  and is expected to continue to intensify 
if we are unable to hire the talent required by our clients in a timely  cost effective manner  our ability to grow our business will be adversely affected 
employee benefit and other employee related costs are significant factors bearing on our ability to hire qualified personnel and control overall labor costs 
in an effort to manage our benefits costs  we have regularly implemented changes to our benefits plans 
while we believe the changes we have implemented will be effective in reducing the costs of those plans  the effectiveness of these changes may vary due to factors such as rising medical costs  the amount of medical services used by our employees  and similar factors 
also  as we make changes to benefit plans to control costs  the risk that it will be more difficult to retain current consultants or to attract and retain new resources will increase 
our ability to continue to respond to our client needs in a cost controlled environment is a key factor to our future success 
our plan calls for us to continue to streamline our operations by consolidating offices  reducing administrative and management personnel and continuing to review our company structure and organization for more efficient methods of operating our business and delivering our services 
our ability to respond to the conditions outlined above will bear directly on our performance 
although we believe we can continue to grow this business  there can be no assurance as to when  or if  we will experience sustained service revenue growth 
strategy we continue to pursue it staffing services in clients of all sizes 
however  the market conditions in this space are very competitive 
without changing our mix of business to include more business where our value add to the client is greater and where we are able to achieve higher margins  we will not be able to generate an acceptable return to our shareholders 
to achieve the objectives of changing our mix of services revenue and returning the company to profitability  we announced a new plan in january designed to restore the company to profitability and increase shareholder value 
the objectives of the plan include i increasing revenue  improving margins and adding sales and recruiting personnel in higher margin businesses  ii expanding our value added services in key metro markets  and iii reducing corporate expenses through consolidation of back office and other corporate overhead functions 
the first step in our plan is to permanently remove certain costs so that the company achieves profitability 
in addition  to achieving sustained profitability  during we plan to implement the following measures add headcount in key functional areas  including sales  recruiting  project management and consulting  in order to respond to client demand 
expand our solutions business by launching project oriented it consulting practices in our most attractive us markets 
in we plan to continue our expansion in additional markets throughout the us 
exit businesses that are non core and non strategic to our new plan and focus on our core  it related competencies and clients 
invest in our it systems in order to simplify  streamline and automate our business processes 
while implementing our plan  we will continue to pursue clients of all sizes  but our primary focus will be on medium sized businesses 
we will also continue to pursue business opportunities with technology and product partners such as cisco and microsoft 
partnering with vendors like these is an important factor in achieving growth in revenue and profit 
our services in this area are focused around the following major practice areas application development and support  including microsoft technologies  pmo services  business analysts  quality assurance and testing services ip communications which includes wireless  ip telecommunications  contact center and security services infrastructure and storage solutions which includes vmware services lawson services which includes integration  customization and administration of lawson software applications it outsourcing which includes application outsourcing  help desk  hosting  and field engineering services in addition  we seek to expand our vertical market presence in the state and local government arena 
in this vertical market  we are providing a broad array of services including criminal justice information systems and mobile and wireless solutions 
other factors terms and conditions standard to it services contracts present a risk to our business 
in general  our clients can cancel or reduce their contracts on short notice 
loss of a significant client relationship or a significant portion thereof or a significant number of smaller contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act under section of the act has created substantial cost to us and strained our internal resources 
we incurred significant costs throughout  and we expect to continue to incur such costs in future years for maintaining compliance 
an inability to control these costs  a failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  or a failure to adequately remediate control deficiencies as they are identified  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe our working capital will be sufficient for the foreseeable needs of our business 
significant rapid growth in our business  a major acquisition  a significant lengthening of payment terms with major clients  or significant costs associated with non operating activities such as our need to address shareholder matters like the one described above  could create a need for additional working capital 
an inability to obtain additional working capital  should it be required  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we expect to be able to comply with the requirements of our credit agreement  however  failure to do so could affect our ability to obtain necessary working capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
overview of results of operations total revenue for the year ended december  fiscal year was million  an increase from million in the year ended december  fiscal year 
the increase in revenue included a decline in revenue from services we supply directly to clients and a increase in revenue from services we provide to our clients through sub suppliers 
we also saw an increase in product sales 
the increase in product sales is attributable primarily to the growth in our ip communications voice over internet protocol  voip or ip telephony business where we are a reseller of cisco and other telephony products 
in  direct services represented of our revenues  compared to in our overall gross margin on total revenue declined from in to in  and our gross margin on direct services revenue decreased from in to in our net loss for fiscal was million  including million in special charges relating to restructuring  severance and the write off of goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets 
this compared with last year s net loss of million 
on a diluted per share basis  for the year ended december   including special charges of 
per share  our net loss was 
per share  compared with a net loss of 
per share in fiscal year at year end  our balance sheet reflected million of working capital and a balance of million on our working capital line of credit 
this compares to working capital of million and a balance of million on our working capital line of credit at the beginning of the year 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the estimates described below are the most sensitive estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements 
estimates of future operating results realization of certain assets recorded in our balance sheet is dependent upon our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
in evaluating the recorded value of our intangible assets  goodwill  and deferred tax assets for indication of impairment  we are required to make critical accounting estimates regarding the future operating results of the company 
these estimates are based on management s current expectations but involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
to evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment  we rely heavily on the discounted cash flow method to assess the value of the associated reporting units 
the discounted cash flow valuation technique requires us to project operating results and the related cash flows over a ten year period 
these projections involve risks  uncertainties and other factors and are by their nature subjective 
if actual results were substantially below projected results  an impairment of the recorded value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets could result 
please refer to notes c and j to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
to assess the recorded value of our deferred tax assets for possible impairment  we must predict the likelihood of future taxable income generation 
realization of any net deferred tax assets requires the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the federal net operating loss carry forward benefits 
although federal net operating loss nol carry forward benefits of     and  do not expire until     and  respectively  at the end of fiscal year  we determined  based on past operating performance  that we could no longer demonstrate that we were more likely than not  as defined in statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  to realize the benefit of these assets 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
allowance for doubtful accounts in each accounting period  we determine an amount to set aside to cover potentially uncollectible accounts 
we base our determination on an evaluation of accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s ability to make contractually required payments 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include reviewing the financial stability of the client  the clients willingness to pay and current market conditions 
if our evaluation of a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future charges 
accrual of unreported medical claims in each accounting period  we estimate an amount to accrue for medical costs incurred but not yet reported ibnr under our self funded employee medical insurance plans 
we base our determination on an evaluation of past rates of claim payouts and trends in the amount of payouts 
this determination requires significant judgment and assumes past patterns are representative of future payment patterns and that we have identified any trends in our claim experience 
a significant shift in usage and payment patterns within our medical plans could necessitate significant adjustments to these accruals in future accounting periods 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties or affect significant line items within our financial statements and potentially result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for our staffing  professional services and the majority of our solutions business as services are performed 
this includes staffing services  technology integration services  outsourcing services and advisory services that are billed on an hourly basis 
for product sales  except in rare circumstances  we act as the primary obligor in the transaction 
accordingly  except for those rare situations where net revenue reporting is appropriate because we are acting as an agent in the sale of product  product revenue is recorded for the gross amount of the transaction when the products are delivered 
certain of our outsourcing and help desk engagements provide for a specific level of service each month 
we generally bill for these services at a standard monthly rate 
revenue for these engagements is recognized in monthly installments over the period of the contract 
in some such contracts  we invoice in advance for two or more months of service 
when we do this  the revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the contractual agreement 
in certain situations we will contract to sell both product including third party software and or hardware and services in a single client arrangement with multiple deliverables 
these arrangements are generally to resell certain products and to provide the service necessary to install such products and optimize functionality of such products 
we account for multiple deliverable arrangements involving third party software products under the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition when we are able to establish vendor specific objective evidence as to the fair value of each deliverable 
other multiple deliverable arrangements not involving software are accounted for utilizing the guidelines of etif  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we account for each of the components of multiple deliverable arrangements separately by using the identified fair values of each component to allocate the total consideration of the arrangement to the separate components 
in certain client situations  where the nature of the engagement requires it  we utilize the services of other companies in our industry 
if these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs  we classify the amount billed to the client as sub supplier revenue 
these revenues  however  are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor for rendering services to our client 
all revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other independent contractors who work directly for us are recorded as direct revenue 
we periodically enter into fixed price engagements 
when we enter into such engagements  revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on time and materials input to date and estimated time and materials to complete the project 
this method of revenue recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope and duration of the engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
goodwill and other intangible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we currently perform the annual test as of the last day of its monthly accounting period for august 
this evaluation relies on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
effective january   we ceased amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we performed our annual impairment evaluation on september  and determined the fair value of our reporting units were sufficient to support the recorded goodwill 
in making this determination  we utilized professionally appropriate income and market comparable methodologies to determine the fair values of the reporting units 
the fair values exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units by only a small margin 
the valuation methodology used relied heavily on a discounted cash flow analysis prepared using long term operating projections prepared by management 
these projections involve risks and uncertainties  and are by their nature subject to change in the economic realities of the markets in which we operate 
in december  we adopted a new business plan that significantly changed the key business strategies assumed in the september  goodwill evaluation described above 
also  during the fourth quarter we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
together  we concluded that these events represented an indication that our intangible assets may be impaired 
accordingly  we performed another impairment evaluation at december   to reflect these changes in circumstance 
as a result of this new evaluation  on december   we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our solutions and staffing reporting units totaling million 
please see note j to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in  we found indications of possible goodwill impairment in our solutions business  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
this impairment of value was the result of gradual erosion in the operating results of this reporting unit 
the primary service provided within this reporting unit is application development services  including the web development services acquired as part of the sequoianet 
com  inc acquisition in in the year leading up to  the demand for these services in the marketplace had declined steadily  and our results in this area declined along with the market generally 
please see note j to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between reported income and income considered taxable by the taxing authorities 
our total deferred tax asset balance at december  was million 
sfas no 
also requires the resulting deferred tax assets to be reduced by a valuation allowance if some portion or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized 
while we had previously established valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax asset to million  at the end of fiscal year  based on past operating performance and estimates of future taxable income  we concluded we could no longer demonstrate that we were more likely than not  as defined by sfas no 
 to realize our net deferred tax asset of million 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance to fully reserve these assets 
please see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to establishing this valuation allowance  during we recorded  of income tax expense related to subsidiaries where profitability was achieved and state taxes were paid 
for fiscal  we recorded no income tax benefit associated with the net loss we generated because the benefit created by our operating loss has been negated by the establishment of additional reserves against our deferred assets 
if we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets which are currently reserved becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse the existing valuation allowances resulting in an income tax benefit 
restructuring and other severance related costs during  we recorded restructuring and other severance charges of million 
of these charges  million related to lease obligations and abandonment costs net of sub lease income in locations where we have chosen to downsize or exit completely 
during  we reserved for additional lease obligations of  and accrued million of additional severance charges to affect our new business plan and certain senior leadership changes 
while we believe our current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  our inability to sublet the remaining space  negotiate early termination agreements or obtain payments from sub lessees could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates in the future 
sales taxes we account for our sales tax and any other taxes that are collected from our clients and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis 
the assessment  collection and payment of these taxes are not reflected on our income statement 
income taxes analysts international corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return in the us federal jurisdiction 
we also file consolidated or separate company income tax returns in most states  canada federal  ontario province  and  the united kingdom 
as of december   there are no federal  state  and foreign income tax audits in progress 
we are no longer subject to us federal audits for tax years before  and with few exceptions  the same for state and local audits 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on december  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin was effective for the company beginning december  upon implementation  we determined our positions will more likely than not be sustained if challenged 
therefore  no cumulative effect relating to the adoption of fin resulted 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within interest and penalties expense 
during the twelve months ended december  we have not recognized expense for interest and penalties  and  do not have any amounts accrued at december  and december  respectively  for the payment of interest and penalties 
results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories and provides a count of employees and technical consultants for fiscal year versus fiscal year the tables provide guidance in our explanation of our operations and results 
year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands amount of revenue amount of revenue amount inc dec as of revenue revenue professional services provided directly professional services provided through sub suppliers product sales total revenue expenses salaries  contracted services and direct charges cost of product sales selling  administrative and other operating costs amortization of intangible assets expenses related to attempted merger restructuring costs and other severance related costs impairment of intangible assets goodwill impairment non operating income interest expense loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss personnel management and administrative technical consultants revenue services revenue provided directly by analysts international s employees during the year ended december  decreased from the comparable period a year ago  while revenue from sub suppliers and product sales increased and  respectively  during the same period 
early in  we experienced a significant decline in the number of billable technical staff due to a high number of purchase order expirations 
this is typical for our business 
we made some progress during on improving average bill rates and regaining some of the headcount we lost early in the year 
by the end of  however  we had not returned to our beginning headcount numbers  and we had not managed to return our direct services revenue to levels 
while demand for our services remains constant  competition is intense 
our plan for and beyond calls for us to concentrate our efforts on growing revenue from smaller more profitable accounts  and de emphasizing our large national client relationships where margins are not attractive due to rate demands from these larger clients 
while implementing this strategy  we expect total service revenue to remain at current levels or possibly decline slightly 
during fiscal year  a higher percentage of our total revenue came from sub suppliers as compared to fiscal year our sub supplier revenue is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees for management and administration providing minimal profit 
in october  we began providing managed services to a significant new client 
as a result of this new relationship  sub supplier revenue grew in product sales increased over fiscal year the increase in product sales occurred largely in our ip communications business where we resell a significant amount of cisco ip telephony products 
while product revenue continues to be a part of our strategy  in and beyond  we will be focused primarily on growing our more profitable service revenue 
we expect product revenue to remain constant in  both in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
salaries  contracted services and direct charges salaries  contracted services and direct charges primarily represent our payroll and benefit costs associated with billable consultants 
as a percent of service revenue including sub supplier revenue  these costs increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year excluding the revenue and cost associated with sub suppliers  however  these costs increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this decrease in direct service margins was driven by our mix of business which includes a higher concentration of national account and sub supplier business where margins are lower than our other direct business and a continuing decline in the margins we generate from our largest client 
we continuously attempt to control the factors which affect this category of expense  however  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or improve this level 
cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost of the hardware and software products we sell 
these costs  as a percentage of product sales  decreased from in to in although a change in policy at one of our technology partners enabled us to drive product revenue higher during much of  the products comprising much of this increased volume was sold at lower margins than we have seen in previous periods 
these lower margins during much of the year were offset by very favorable margins on products sold during the fourth quarter 
vendor pricing and promotional programs change regularly causing the margins we realize when selling product to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our current margins on product revenue 
selling  administrative and other operating costs selling  administrative and other operating sg a costs include management and administrative salaries  commissions paid to sales representatives and recruiters  location costs  and other administrative costs 
this category of costs represented of total revenue for  down slightly from in the decline in these costs is reflective of the cost reduction measures implemented early in following the adoption of a performance improvement plan in april we are committed to continually managing this category of expense to the right level for the company  and the plan we adopted in december calls for significant further cost reductions in amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is related primarily to our client list 
this amortization is expected to decline in following the impairment of certain of these assets 
see further discussion below 
restructuring costs and other severance related costs in connection with the implementation of our new business plan and other executive management changes early in  we recorded restructuring and severance related costs of million during of this amount  million related to workforce reductions and severance 
the remaining  related to lease obligations and abandonment costs net of anticipated sub lease income for locations where we have chosen to downsize or exit completely 
impairment of intangible assets during the year ended december   following the termination of the principals of redwood solutions corporation  a company we acquired in  we experienced a gradual decline in revenue associated with a major client relationship acquired as part of that transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  revenue from this client relationship continued to decline  and management determined it would not attempt to re engage with this relationship 
we determined the intangible client based asset  which had been established when redwood solutions was acquired  had become impaired 
as such  the asset  originally valued at million  net of  of accumulated amortization  was written off 
this write off resulted in an impairment charge of million 
on december   our board of directors adopted a plan to refocus the company 
the plan calls for the company to become one business selling and delivering to analysts international s promise of quality 
as such  a decision was made to aggressively cease using the sequoianet 
com tradename acquired in fiscal year following this decision  the sequoianet 
com tradename  originally valued at million  with a net recorded value of million  was written down to its fair value 
this write down resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the remaining fair value of this tradename  will be amortized over the first six months of fiscal year  the period of time during which the tradename is expected to continue to bring value 
goodwill impairment in december  we adopted a plan that significantly changed the key business strategies assumed in the september  evaluation of goodwill 
also  during the fourth quarter we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  which we concluded indicated that our goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired  we performed another impairment evaluation at december   to analyze these changes in circumstance 
as a result of this new evaluation  we determined the fair value of the staffing and solutions reporting units no longer exceed the carrying value of those reporting units 
accordingly  we allocated the fair value of the respective reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit  based on the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  utilizing the relevant guidance in sfas no 
 business combinations 
based upon this allocation study  impairment charges of million and million  respectively  were recorded to reduce the goodwill associated with the staffing and solutions reporting units to their indicated fair values of million and million  respectively 
non operating income non operating income consisted primarily of a non cash item resulting from the return of  shares of common stock from an escrow account following the departure of two principals of a company we acquired in these shares were valued at  interest expense interest expense during fiscal year decreased by approximately  compared to fiscal year due to a decrease in average borrowings under the line of credit from million to million and a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes during we recorded million of income tax expense 
the majority of this expense relates to a  increase to the valuation allowance to fully reserve our remaining deferred tax assets at the end of see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
the remaining approximately  of income tax expense related to subsidiaries where profitability was achieved and state taxes were due 
during the year  we continued our practice of recording no income tax benefit associated with our net losses because the benefit created by our operating losses have been negated by the establishment of additional reserves against our deferred assets 
if we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets which are currently reserved  becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse our existing valuation allowances resulting in an income tax benefit 
personnel our billable technical consulting staff levels finished the year down by approximately consultants from where we started the year 
this number excludes headcount of our sub suppliers and headcount from medical concepts staffing  our medical staffing business  which accounts for an immaterial amount of our revenue

a higher percentage of our total revenue came from sub suppliers during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our sub supplier revenue is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees for management and administration providing minimal profit 
while demand for it services increased slightly during  we experienced a change in the mix of our business with a greater percentage of our revenue coming from national accounts where we relied more heavily on our sub suppliers to deliver services 
product sales increased over fiscal year the increase in product sales was due largely to our ip communications services where we resell a significant amount of cisco ip telephony products

cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost of the hardware and software products we sell 
these costs  as a percentage of product sales  decreased from in to in this decrease was due mainly to increased product sales in emerging technologies such as our ip communications product and services offering where our margins are higher and where  during  we enjoyed greater discounts from vendors due to our higher sales volume and promotional programs offered by the vendors

finally  we made payments of approximately million to fund general operating expenses such as employee expense reimbursement  office space rental and utilities 
the cash to fund these significant payments comes almost exclusively from our collection of amounts due for services rendered to our clients approximately million in fiscal year 
generally  payments made to fund the day to day operation of our business are due and payable regardless of the rate of cash collections from our clients 
while we do not anticipate such an occurrence  a significant decline in the rate of collections from our clients  or our inability to timely invoice and therefore collect from our clients  could rapidly increase our need to borrow to fund the operations of our business 
sources and uses of cash credit facility cash and cash equivalents decreased by  from december  to december  the outstanding debt on our line of credit decreased from million at december  to million at december  generally  our primary need for working capital is to support accounts receivable resulting from our business and to fund the time lag between payroll disbursement  a bi weekly occurrence  and receipt of fees billed to clients

of the unused portion of the line  and an annual administration fee of  the credit agreement carries an interest rate on daily advances equal to the wall street journal s prime rate on december  and on fixed term advances equal to the libor rate plus 
working capital at december  decreased from december  primarily as a result of additional restructuring obligations  and an increase in the current portion of our deferred compensation caused by executive management changes that occurred as part of our restructuring

the timing of the repurchases is based on several factors  including the price of the common stock  general market conditions  corporate and regulatory requirements and alternate investment opportunities 
repurchases may be made in the open market or through private transactions  in accordance with sec requirements 
repurchases may be suspended at any time and are subject to the terms and conditions of our credit agreement with ge capital  which includes restrictions based on our borrowing availability under the credit agreement and a maximum expenditure for repurchases 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share
