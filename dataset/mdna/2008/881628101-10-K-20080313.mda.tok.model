item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  financial condition and prospects 

table of contents business overview we are an independent energy company engaged primarily in the development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas in north america 
our current operations are focused in four basins in the rocky mountain region of the united states the piceance  dj  williston and big horn basins 
as of december   we had estimated proved reserves of bcf of natural gas and mbbl of oil  or a total of bcfe  with a pv value of million see reconciliation of the pv non gaap financial measure to the standardized measure under reserves on page 
of these reserves  were proved developed reserves 
estimated proved reserves are natural gas 
at december   we controlled approximately  net acres  representing approximately of our total net acreage position 
we intend economically to grow reserves and production  primarily by acquiring under valued properties with reasonable risk reward potential and by participating in  or actively conducting  drilling operations in order further to exploit our existing properties  seeking high quality exploration and development projects with potential for providing operated  long term drilling inventories  and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions that may expand or complement our existing operations 
developments since december  during  we continued to grow oil and gas production and reserves  while participating in an active development program within the four basins  which we expect to continue in our non operated piceance basin property had proved reserves of bcf at december  on october   we sold of our working interest in the property  leaving us with a working interest in the piceance basin property 
for the divested interest  we received million in cash prior to post closing adjustments plus mmcfed of production and  gross acres in the dj basin 
after the divestiture of one half of our interest  after production and after drilling during  at december   our interest in the piceance basin property had proved reserves of bcfe 
piceance basin production for the year ended december   was mmcf of natural gas  and we participated in the drilling of an additional gross wells  bringing the total number of gross producing wells to at december  there are currently wells waiting on completion and two in process of drilling  as part of the planned well  million piceance drilling program in fiscal year saw growth in our acreage position in the dj basin of gross and net 
at december   we held interests in approximately  gross acres approximately  net 
during the year ended december   we added approximately  gross acres approximately  net in the dj basin 
of the growth in acreage  approximately  gross acres approximately  net are in the non operated teton noble ami  approximately  gross acres approximately  net are in our operated frenchman creek area  approximately  gross acres approximately  net are in our operated south frenchman creek area and approximately  gross acres approximately  net are in our operated washco properties 
at december  we have producing wells in the non operated teton noble ami and producing wells in our operated washco properties 
dj basin production for the year ended december   was mmcf of natural gas and  bbls of oil  and our total number of gross producing wells is at december  there are currently wells waiting on completion as part of the well  million dj basin drilling program in planned in the non operated dj basin noble ami and planned in our operated frenchman creek area 
we participated in the drilling of two bakken test wells and a red river test well in the williston basin of north dakota in the year ended december  the operator is preparing to stake and permit a second red river test well  and we expect to participate in additional bakken wells and additional red river wells in during the year ended december   we acquired a working interest in  gross acres  net in the big horn basin of wyoming 
we are seeking a partner to share in this acreage and the future drilling in the greybull and mowry formations in the big horn basin 
we expect to drill wells in the greybull and wells in the mowry in 
table of contents financial highlights for the year ended december  include the following our net income was million in as compared to a net loss of million in we raised million after fees and expenses by issuing senior subordinated convertible notes and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock with a cashless exercise provision 
we raised million after fees and expenses by issuing  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares 
we completed a capital expenditure program totaling million in as compared to million in the following summarizes our operational highlights during we increased our oil and gas sales volumes to bcfe in from mmcfe in our oil and gas revenues increased to million at an average realized wellhead price of per mcfe after realized hedging results in from revenues of million and an average realized wellhead price of per mcfe in we sold half of our working interest in the piceance basin non operated properties for million in cash  after post closing adjustments  plus oil and gas properties and related production valued at million  after post closing adjustments  for a gain on sale of assets totaling million 
we increased proved reserves to bcfe on december  as compared to bcfe on december  we participated in the drilling and completion of gross producing wells net in as compared to gross producing wells net to us in we increased total gross producing wells to net at december  as compared to gross producing wells net to us at december  we acquired  gross acres  net in  comprised of the following acres acquired in gross net piceance basin dj basin noble ami frenchman creek s 
frenchman creek washco williston basin big horn basin total the exploration for  and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating reserve and production growth while containing costs represents an ongoing focus for management and is made particularly important in our business by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties 
in addition to developing new reserves  we compete to acquire additional reserves  which involve judgments regarding recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  third party contractor and material cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
other challenges we face include attracting and retaining qualified personnel  gaining access to equipment and supplies and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have taken the following steps to mitigate the challenges we face 
table of contents we attempt to reduce our overall exposure to commodity price fluctuations through the use of various hedging contracts for some of our production 
the duration of our various hedging contracts depends on our view of market conditions  available contract prices and our operating strategy 
use of such contracts may limit the risk of fluctuating cash flows 
as of december   we had hedging contracts in effect for approximately of our current daily production increased to approximately when we added  mmbtus per day of production via costless collars at february  
we have an inventory of drilling locations that we believe will allow us to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically without having to rely solely on acquisitions 
we estimate in excess of  prospective drilling opportunities in the piceance  dj  williston and big horn basins are expected to last for more than years 
on april   we announced that our universal shelf registration statements on forms s and s with the securities and exchange commission were declared effective 
the universal shelf on form s now permits  but does not obligate  teton to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of newly issued common stock  shares of newly issued preferred stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
there is approximately million remaining available under the form s shelf registration at december  the acquisition shelf registration statement on form s permits teton to issue up to million of its common stock and warrants in one or more acquisition transactions that the company may make from time to time 
these transactions may include the acquisition of assets  businesses or securities  whether by purchase  merger or any other form of business combination 
we have no immediate plans  commitments or agreements to offer any securities pursuant to either registration statement at december  see discussion directly below related to developments since december  for possible use of s shelf registration if acquisition closes  but believe each of the shelf registrations provides flexibility to quickly respond to opportunities in the future 
the terms of any future offerings would be established at the time of the offerings and described in a prospectus supplement filed with the sec 
developments since december  on february   we announced the signing of a letter of intent to acquire reserves  production and certain oil and gas properties in the central kansas uplift of kansas from a group of approximately working interest owners sellers for approximately million before adjustments 
the purchase price is expected to be funded with million in cash and million in teton common stock to be issued under the shelf registration statement on form s discussed above 
terms also include warrant coverage of  shares at a strike price with a two year term 
the company expects its bank credit facility s available borrowing base to grow to approximately to million as a result of the added reserves from this transaction 
the transaction is anticipated to be funded from the increased bank credit facility and cash on hand 
closing is expected to occur on or before april  with an effective date of march  the purchase price includes an estimated billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe or million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of proved reserves and an estimated million cubic feet equivalent per day mmcfed or barrels of oil equivalent boe of daily production as of march  the sellers proved reserves are approximately percent oil and percent of their reserves are developed pdp or pdnp  located on approximately  gross  net acres 
when combined with teton s existing reserves  teton will have proved reserves of approximately percent natural gas and percent oil 
in addition  the ratio of teton s developed reserves in the proved category will increase from percent to percent 
production from the sellers assets is approximately percent oil and eight percent natural gas 
when combined with teton s existing production  teton will have production of approximately percent natural gas and percent oil 
teton anticipates hedging the commodity price of at least percent of the oil pdp production related to this transaction for five years in order to lock in base case economics 
the purchase price includes producing wells  wells with production behind pipe  five wells drilling or waiting on completion and identified undeveloped locations 
the proved assets to be acquired have a percent working interest and a percent net revenue interest to teton 
this acquisition will nearly double teton s year end proved reserves of bcfe and teton s exit production rate of mmcfed 
in addition  the purchase price 
table of contents includes square miles of d seismic with additional seismic to be acquired in it also includes  gross  net undeveloped acres where teton operates  at percent working interest to teton and percent working interest to sellers 
the company believes the undeveloped acreage could yield additional upside potential to teton 
teton and sellers have also agreed to a go forward month area of mutual interest to pursue additional acreage and resource opportunities where teton will operate under the same working interest split with sellers as described on the existing undeveloped acreage

table of contents results of operations compared to we had net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million compared to a net loss of million for the same period in factors contributing to the million increase in net income from to included the following we sold half of our working interest in the piceance basin non operated properties for million in cash  including purchase price adjustments  and oil and gas properties and related production valued at million  for a gain on sale of assets totaling million 
oil and gas production net to our interest in was bcfe resulting in million in oil and gas sales  at an average wellhead price of per mcfe for the year 
in our net production was mmcfe resulting in million in oil and gas sales  at an average wellhead price of 
the increase in production volumes resulted from additional wells being put on line in the lower average price per mcfe resulted from prices in being higher than normal due largely to the severity of the hurricane season in late  the effects of which lasted into the first half of additionally  rocky mountain natural gas traded at a higher than normal discount to natural gas in the rest of the country during parts of due to pipeline capacity constraints limiting the ability to move gas that was produced in the rocky mountain region into other areas of the country 
the completion of the rocky mountain express pipeline rex  which is ultimately projected to move up to bcfd of natural gas out of the rocky mountain region  is expected to help alleviate the capacity constraints 
the first sections of rex began operation in early  and the final completion is scheduled for our lease operating expenses  transportation costs and production taxes for increased to  over   over and  over  respectively  due largely to the increase in oil and gas sales in compared to lease operating expense increased by an additional over the increase in production resulting from the fact that the new production in each of the piceance  dj and williston basins caused some operating inefficiencies while the outside operators were learning the best approaches to operating in new locations  and due to severe weather in early resulting in some additional lease operating expenses 
as the outside operators are adding more wells and becoming more familiar with the operating areas  the lease operating expenses are beginning to decrease from the higher levels associated with new producing areas 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due largely to a net increase in compensation expense of approximately million due to approximately  of non cash compensation expense increase from stock based grants as a result of meeting performance milestones associated with our long term incentive plan and an increase in salaries of approximately  a net increase of approximately  in consulting and related expenses associated with sox compliance  oil and gas accounting services  investor relations  compensation benchmarking reports and study  and financial and legal services related to acquisitions  financings and the divestiture of part of the piceance properties 
exploration expenses for of million relate largely to delay rentals  geological and geophysical expenses incurred by us in the eastern dj and williston basins and the reclassification of general and administrative expense noted directly above 
we use d seismic studies to locate potential drilling sites in each basin 
depletion and depreciation expense increased from million in to million in due to the higher gas production volumes in compared to during we recognized an unrealized derivative loss of  related to derivative contracts natural gas and crude oil fixed price swaps 
the loss represents marking the contracts to market at december   based on the future expected prices of the related commodities 
actual results from the contracts will be booked as realized gains losses as the production volumes being hedged are actually produced 

table of contents interest income  and interest expense million in include interest income from the cash balances maintained and interest expense on our line of credit combined with amortization of deferred debt issuance costs 
we maintained higher cash balances late in resulting from the partial sale of interest in the piceance property 
results of operations compared to we had a net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million compared to a net loss of million for the same period in factors contributing to the larger net loss for the year included the following oil and gas production net to our interest in was  mcfe resulting in million in oil and gas sales  at an average wellhead price of per mcfe for the year 
in our net production began in july oil and gas production net to us in was  mcfe resulting in  in oil and gas sales  at an average wellhead price of per mcfe for the year 
the increased production resulted from additional wells being put on line in the higher average price per mcfe resulted largely from the extreme hurricane season that occurred in late  putting gulf of mexico production out of service and increasing the price for natural gas from other areas of the country being used to fill demand 
our lease operating expenses  transportation costs and production taxes for increased to  over   over and  over  respectively  due largely to the increase in oil and gas sales in compared to additionally  bringing new operations on line in the oil and gas business often entails a learning curve on how to best operate the wells  which further increased our lease operating expenses for general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due largely to compensation expense increasing due to million of non cash compensation expense from stock based grants as a result of meeting performance milestones associated with our long term incentive plan  a non cash expense of approximately  associated with restricted stock grants  and approximately  resulting from an increase in the number of full time employees from six employees in to employees in  consulting expenses associated with engineering  marketing  investor relations and financial services increasing approximately  in from due to the increased operations of teton resulting in additional needs that were not met with hiring of additional staff  office expense increasing approximately  in from due to increased administrative and computer support as well as additional office space leased 
however  certain components of general and administrative expenses decreased during the period  which include legal and accounting costs decreasing by million from the prior year  due to non cash issuance of common stock for accounting and legal services rendered in of  for which we also received a refund of  shares of common stock for accounting services valued at  which reduced our general and administrative expenses in and approximately  due to the replacement of a part time  contract cfo with a full time  in house cfo 
exploration expenses for of  relate to delay rentals and geological and geophysical expenses incurred by us primarily on the eastern dj basin leases  which were acquired in depletion and depreciation expense increased from  in to million in due to the higher gas production volumes in compared to during we recognized an unrealized derivative gain of  related to a derivative contract natural gas costless collar 
in we did not have any derivative contracts 

table of contents interest income and interest expense in include interest income from the cash balances maintained and interest expense on our line of credit 
outlook for the following summarizes our goals and objectives for increase production by at least to bcfe from the properties in which we own interests at december  achieve material increase in reserves 
continue to develop the piceance  dj and williston basin acreage 
begin the development of the big horn basin acreage 
maintain liquidity through increases in our senior credit facility borrowing base and increased cash flow provided by operations 
pursue additional operated oil and gas asset and project acquisitions 
continue to build our operating staff and related capabilities 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by equity offerings and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet the needs of the business 
as a result of our developmental drilling program progress added more than producing wells in  we expect that cash flow from operating activities will also contribute to our cash requirements during and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
we can give no assurances that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources  or cash flow from operating activities  will be available for future development projects  and we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources 
product prices and volumes  as well as the timely collection of receivables and the availability of oil field services and supplies such as concrete  pipe and compression equipment are all expected to have a significant influence on our future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon the success and timing of our exploration and production activities  new project development  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe that the amounts available under our million bank credit facility million borrowing base at december  and the million of cash in the bank at december   together with the anticipated net cash provided by operating activities during  will provide us with sufficient funds to develop new reserves  maintain our current facilities and complete our current capital expenditure program through depending on the timing and amount of future projects  as well as the amount of the increase we receive in our borrowing base related to the reserves we intend to purchase in the central kansas uplift see additional discussion above on page  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
we may also receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and or options as we did during the years ended december   and at march   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding 
these warrants have a weighted average exercise price of per share and expire between april and december at march   options to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding 
these options have a weighted average exercise price of per share and expire between april and may credit facility in june  we established a million revolving credit facility with bnp paribas the credit facility 
the credit facility had an initial borrowing base of million  was redetermined to million on march   and had an original maturity of june  the credit facility with bnp paribas was replaced on august  by an amended and restated credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na the amended and restated credit facility provides for as much as million in borrowing capacity  depending upon a number of factors  such as the projected value of our proven oil and gas assets 
the borrowing base for the credit facility at any time will be the loan value assigned to the proved reserves attributable to our subsidiaries direct or indirect oil and gas interests 
the borrowing base will be redetermined on a semi annual basis  based upon an engineering report delivered by us 
table of contents from an approved petroleum engineer 
the credit facility is available for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
at december   the credit facility had a borrowing base of million with million outstanding 
cash flows and capital expenditures our capital budget for is currently estimated at million for the planned drilling in the piceance  dj and williston basins 
in addition  we are planning to drill four wells in the big horn basin that are not currently in our budget 
the amounts to be included for those properties will be determined when we have added a partner to the operation 
our planned development and exploration expenses could also increase if any of the operations associated with our properties experience cost overruns  or if berry  as operator for the piceance basin play  increases the drilling program  noble  as operator for the teton noble ami play  increases the drilling program  or evertson  as operator for the williston basin play  increases the drilling program 
our primary capital needs for the three years ended december   and were as of december  in thousands property acquisition costs exploration development total operating activities during the year ended december   we used million of net cash for operating activities  an increase of  over our net income of million for was adjusted for non cash items to arrive at the net cash used in operating activities 
the non cash depreciation  depletion and accretion increased by million due the addition of approximately new net wells drilled in  resulting in a larger base to deplete and more production 
we had million of non cash debt issuance costs and debt discount amortization  as well as non cash loss on derivative contract liabilities related to our issuance of convertible notes see
