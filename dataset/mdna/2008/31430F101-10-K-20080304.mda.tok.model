we had declared a quarterly common dividend on our common stock from our inception through  but as a result of the uncertain geopolitical environment and soft business climate  together with the decline in hotel ebitda margins resulting from continued declines in our portfolio s average daily rate  our board of directors suspended the payment of dividends on our common stock in and we have  however  continued to pay the full accrued dividends on our outstanding preferred stock

through december   we completed renovations at of these hotels of which were completed in 
we currently expect to complete renovations at additional hotels by march   and we expect to complete the remaining renovations by year end in  of these hotels were undergoing some form of renovation taking rooms out of service and creating disruption at these hotels 
despite renovation related disruptions in  we experienced growth in revenue per available room  or revpar  compared to we had completed renovations in hotels by the end of the third quarter revpar in the fourth quarter at those hotels increased compared to the same period in prior year  indicating positive impact on revpar from these renovations 
we believe that our renovated hotels will continue to perform better than the industry average and expect out hotel revpar growth to accelerate significantly in in  we sold consolidated hotels thereby completing the disposition of non strategic hotels that we originally identified in through the course of this disposition program  we sold consolidated hotels for aggregate gross proceeds of million and used the proceeds to pay down debt and fund our renovation program 
in december  we acquired two upper upscale resort hotels  the renaissance esmeralda resort spa in indian wells  california and the renaissance vinoy resort golf club in st 
petersburg  florida for a total purchase price of million 
these acquisitions are consistent with our stated strategy to continue to improve the overall quality and diversity of our hotel portfolio 
the hotels meet our criteria of acquiring upper upscale hotels and resorts in markets with high barriers to entry and also allow us to enhance our return on investment through various redevelopment opportunities 
in  we completed construction of our unit royale palms condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
through december   we have sold units and recognized an aggregate gain of million 
the majority of these condominiums have entered our rental pool  thereby providing additional ongoing income 
at december   we had five remaining condominium units to sell 
in  we began the process of rebranding our san francisco union square property as a marriott hotel 
the related renovation will include guest rooms  public areas and building exterior and should be completed by early marriott took over management of the hotel in december and is operating this hotel as hotel union square during the renovation period 
for  we declared common dividends totaling per share 
we increased our quarterly dividend twice during  from per share to per share in the second quarter and then to per share for the fourth quarter

further discussion and a detailed reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to our financial statements are found elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
included in income loss from continuing operations applicable to common shareholders are the following amounts in thousands year ended december  loss on early extinguishment of debt charge off of deferred debt costs abandoned projects gain on swap termination gain loss on sale of assets gain on sale of condominiums consistent with sec guidance on non gaap financial measures  ffo has not been adjusted for the following amounts included in net income loss in thousands  except per share amounts

year ended december  impairment loss  net of minority interests charges related to debt extinguishment  net of minority interests gain on swap termination asset disposition costs abandoned projects gain on sale of hotels  net of income tax and minority interests gain on sale of hotels in unconsolidated entities revpar and hotel operating margin in  we had our fourth consecutive year over year increase in revpar 
for the year  revpar increased from to 
the increase in revpar was made up of a increase in adr while occupancy dropped to 
we attribute the increase in revpar to a strong lodging industry  improved hotel performance following completion of renovation projects in and and a concerted effort to change our customer mix to higher adr business 
we expect revpar to continue increasing in and that improvements in both adr and occupancy will drive revpar growth 
increases in adr generally result in increases in hotel ebitda margins 
hotel ebitda margin at our hotels improved from in to in  but renovation related disruptions were responsible for reduced revpar and caused a basis point decline in our hotel ebitda margin to  compared to we expect to see improvement in as adr continues to be a significant factor in revpar improvement and renovation related disruption decreases 
we are focused on working with our brand managers to control expense growth  improve our hotel ebitda margins and manage renovation displacement to minimize the impact on hotel ebitda margins 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of million  compared million in we had income from continuing operations of million compared to a prior year income from continuing operations of million 
in  income from continuing operations included an million gain from the sale of condominium units at our royale palms condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
income from continuing operations in included an aggregate of million of charges related to early retirement of debt 
total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar 
the increase in revpar resulted from a increase in adr  net of a drop in occupancy  and represents both industry revpar increases in many of our major markets and improvements in our renovated hotels revpar 
going into  the lodging industry is generally expecting an increase in both adr and occupancy 
because our portfolio is largely newly renovated  we expect to outperform the general market in revpar increases 
renovation related disruption had an adverse effect on our adr  occupancy and hotel ebitda margin in our hotel ebitda margin decreased by basis points compared to for  total operating expenses increased by million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to compared to hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  and decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue from to 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased by million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
all of the other property operating costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue compared to except for repair and maintenance cost  which increased slightly as a percent of total revenue from to 
management and franchise fees increased by million compared to but remained constant at of total revenue 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased by million compared to and increased slightly from to of total revenue 
we had increases as a percentage of total revenue in property insurance 
increased property insurance premiums reflect the nationwide trend of increased rates related to catastrophic coverage  but we are currently seeing a softening of property insurance costs 
corporate expenses decreased by million compared to and decreased basis points as a percentage of total revenue 
the decrease in corporate expenses is principally attributed to expenses related to severance costs from executives who left the company in and a reduction in corporate bonus paid in depreciation expense increased by million compared to  which reflects the significant capital expenditures spent in connection with our renovation program in and net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding from billion in to billion in and a basis point decrease in our weighted average interest rate 
during  we refinanced million of our senior notes and million of our mortgage debt at lower interest rates  and we recognized a full year benefit from this in the early retirement of debt in resulted in net debt extinguishment costs of million  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations 
the early retirement of debt in resulted in debt extinguishment costs of million  all of which was recorded in discontinued operations 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in that increase reflects improved revpar and a million net gain from the sale of two unconsolidated hotels in in  we completed construction of our unit royale palms condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
through december   we sold of the units and recognized a gain of million 
discontinued operations provided net income of million in compared to million in included in discontinued operations at december  and  are the operating income or loss  direct interest costs and gains on sale related to the hotels sold in and hotels sold in gains on sale aggregating million and million were included in and income from discontinued operations  respectively 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to a net loss of million in we had income from continuing operations of million compared to a prior year loss from continuing operations of million 
a significant item impacting the current year income from continuing operations was an aggregate of million of charges related to the early retirement of debt 
contributing to the loss from continuing operations were million in losses from hurricanes and million of charges related to the early retirement of debt 
total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar compared to the increase in revpar resulted from increases in adr net of a slight drop in occupancy and represents industry revpar increases in most of our major markets 
the lodging industry nationwide continues to experience increased demand  but there have been only limited increases in room supply leading to strong improvements in revpar in many markets 
our increase in adr was higher than the overall industry average partly because of our concentrated efforts to change the mix of our business to higher adr business 
increased adr typically improves hotel ebitda margin because the hotels are receiving more revenue for each guest 
in  our hotel ebitda margin improved basis points over largely because of the increased adr 
total operating expenses increased by million but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to  largely from improvements in labor costs as a percentage of total revenue 
hotel departmental expenses are directly related to the number of hotel guests and should continue to improve as a percentage of total revenue as rates increase 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
all of the other property operating costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue compared to management and franchise fees increased million compared to and increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue  from to 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue is related to additional incentive fees earned by our management companies 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased million compared to but decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue from to 
we had increases as a percentage of total revenue in percentage lease expense and property insurance  but this was more than offset by decreases as a percentage of total revenue in general liability insurance and property tax expense 
percentage lease expense is computed as a percentage of hotel revenues in excess of a base rent 
as revenues increase  percentage rent expense increases at a faster rate 
property insurance reflects the nationwide trend of increases in rates related to catastrophic coverage 
corporate expenses increased by million compared to and increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in corporate expenses is attributed to severance costs related to several executives that left the company in and additional asset management positions related to our modified asset management approach 
depreciation expense increased by million compared to the increase in depreciation expense reflects the large capital expenditures spent in and net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding during of million  a basis point decrease in our weighted average interest rate and a million increase in capitalized interest 
during  we refinanced million of senior notes and million of mortgage debt at lower interest rates 
as the result of the strong economy  its impact on the travel and lodging industry and our lower secured debt levels  standard poor s and moody s investor services upgraded their ratings on our senior debt  resulting in a basis point decrease in the interest rate on million of our senior debt 
the increase in capitalized interest is related to the expanded capital renovation program at our hotels and the construction loan on our royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina  which we repaid in the second quarter of the early retirement of debt in resulted in net debt extinguishment costs of million  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations 
in  we recorded million in debt extinguishment costs  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in net income from unconsolidated entities owning hotels increased in principally related to improvements in revpar 
minority interest decreased by million compared to  principally resulting from reduction in losses attributed to minority interest holders from improved operations 
discontinued operations provided net income of million in compared to a loss of million in included in discontinued operations at december   are the operating income or loss  direct interest costs and gains on sale related to the hotels sold in  hotels disposed in and the hotels considered held for sale at december  gains on sale aggregating million were included in the income from discontinued operations 
impairment charges recorded under the provisions of sfas aggregating million are included in the loss from discontinued operations in non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report on form k to certain non gaap financial measures 
these measures  including ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following tables reconcile each of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
immediately following the reconciliations  we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and of the limitations upon such measures

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures  including ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and operating managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating corporate level expenses  depreciation and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by minority interest expense and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  as presented by us  may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither should ffo  ffo per share or ebitda be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions or service our debt 
ffo per share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  has historically been hotel operations 
in  net cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of hotel operations  was million 
at december   we had cash on hand of million  including approximately million held under management agreements to meet minimum working capital requirements 
for  we declared and paid common dividends of per share in the aggregate 
our board of directors will determine the amount of future common and preferred dividends for each quarter  based upon the actual operating results for that quarter  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as the minimum reit distribution requirements 
we have committed to spend approximately million to renovate our hotels over a three year period that commenced in we have used proceeds from non strategic hotel sales and proceeds from condominium sales to fund these renovations and repay debt 
the sale of non strategic hotels beginning in late through mid generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
in  we experienced significant displacement from hotel renovations that resulted in reduced revenues and hotel ebitda margins 
we expect that the effect of ongoing renovation displacement for will be less significant  as a substantial amount of our renovations were completed by the end of and most of our remaining renovations will be completed in early we completed our unit royale palms condominium development in the second quarter of through december  we have earned net income of million from the sale of condominium units in the sale of these condominiums provided additional cash to fund our renovation program 
we currently expect that our cash flow provided by operating activities for will be approximately to million 
this forecast assumes revpar increases between and and hotel ebitda margin increases of approximately to basis points 
our current operating plan contemplates that we will make aggregate common dividend payments of approximately million  preferred dividend payments of million and million in normal recurring principal payments  leaving surplus cash flow before capital expenditures or additional debt reduction of approximately to million 
in  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which will be funded from cash and borrowing under our line of credit 
events  including terrorist attacks  natural disasters  us military involvement in the middle east  the subprime mortgage crisis and bankruptcies of major corporations  had an adverse impact on capital markets in prior years 
events  or circumstances of similar magnitude or impact  could adversely affect the availability and cost of our capital 
in addition  the slowdown of the overall economy and of the lodging industry could adversely affect our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs relating to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
we cease capitalizing these costs to projects when construction is substantially complete 
such costs capitalized in   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
because of the reduced level of renovation work in compared to and  we expect to capitalize substantially fewer costs in than in prior years 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses  that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which can produce volatility in our operating results 
if our hotel revpar decreases and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be adversely effected 
during  our pro rata share of capital expenditures spent on our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels was million 
this includes renovations and redevelopment projects 
debt line of credit 
in  we amended our line of credit agreement to increase the amount available under the line from million to million  provide the ability to further increase the facility up to million under certain conditions  reduce certain fees and costs including the interest rates applicable to borrowings  improve certain financial covenants and extend the initial maturity from january to august with the right to extend for an additional one year period under certain conditions 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit 
the interest rate on our line of credit was libor plus at december  and should increase to libor plus in april our million line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants  including a leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  unencumbered leverage ratio and a maximum payout ratio 
the interest rate on our line can range from to basis points over libor  based on our leverage ratio as defined in our line of credit agreement 
in addition to financial covenants  our line of credit includes certain other affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to create or acquire wholly owned subsidiaries  restrictions on the operation ownership of our hotels  limitations on our ability to lease property or guarantee leases of other persons  limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as distributions on common and preferred stock  share repurchases and certain investments  limitations on our ability to merge or consolidate with other persons  to issue stock of our subsidiaries and to sell all or substantially all of our assets  restrictions on our ability to make investments in condominium developments  limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business  limitations on our ability to modify certain instruments  to create liens  to enter into transactions with affiliates  and limitations on our ability to enter into joint ventures 
at the date of this filing  we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
if operating results fall significantly below our current expectations  we may not be able to meet some or all of these covenants in which case we may be unable to borrow under our line of credit 
the breach of any of the covenants and limitations under our line of credit could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding 
our failure to satisfy any accelerated recourse indebtedness  if in the amount of million or more  could result in the acceleration of our other unsecured recourse indebtedness 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances 
our other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than our line of credit 
payment of amounts due under our line of credit is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries who also guarantee payment of our senior debt and payment is secured by a pledge of our limited partnership interest in felcor lp 
mortgage debt 
in december  we assumed an existing loan in the original principal amount of million in connection with our acquisition of the renaissance esmeralda resort spa in indian wells  california and an existing loan in the original principal amount of million in connection with our acquisition of the renaissance vinoy resort golf club in st 
petersburg  florida 
the interest rate on both loans is basis points over the one month libor 
each loan is non recourse to us and secured by a mortgage on its respective property 
both loans mature on may  unless extended  solely at our option  for three successive one year terms  and may be prepaid at any time with no penalty or premium owed 
at december   we had aggregate mortgage indebtedness of approximately million that was secured by of our consolidated hotels with an aggregate book value of approximately billion 
our hotel mortgage debt is recourse solely to the specific assets securing the debt  except in the case of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse carve out provisions 
loans secured by four hotels provide for lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
with respect to two of these loans  we are permitted to retain of budgeted hotel operating expenses  but the remaining revenues would become subject to a lock box arrangement if a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
these hotels currently exceed the minimum debt service coverage ratio  however  under the terms of the loan agreement  the lock box provisions remain in place until the loan is repaid 
none of these hotels has ever fallen below the debt service coverage ratio 
with respect to the mortgage debt assumed in connection with our acquisitions of the renaissance vinoy resort golf club and renaissance esmeralda resort spa  all cash from the hotels in excess of operating expenses  taxes  insurance and capital expenditure reserves is subject to lock box arrangements 
in each case  the lender holds lock box funds that are first applied to meet current debt service obligations and any excess funds are held in the lock box account until the relevant hotel meets or exceeds a debt service coverage ratio of at december   the debt service coverage ratio for one hotel was below our hotel mortgage debt is non recourse to us and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
senior notes 
our publicly traded senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  pay dividends in excess of the minimum dividend required to meet the reit qualification test  repurchase capital stock  or merge 
as of the date of this filing  we have satisfied all such tests 
under the terms of certain of our indentures  we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our capital stock  whether common or preferred  subject to certain exceptions  so long as our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the indentures  exceeds to  which it does at the date of this filing 
debt  as defined in the indentures  approximates our consolidated debt 
ebitda is defined in the indentures as consolidated gaap net income  adjusted for minority interest in felcor lp  actual cash distributions by unconsolidated entities  gains or losses from asset sales  dividends on preferred stock and extraordinary gains and losses as defined at the date of the indentures  plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense and other non cash items 
in addition  if we were unable to continue to satisfy the incurrence test under the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes  we may be prohibited from  among other things  incurring any additional indebtedness  except under certain specific exceptions  or paying dividends on our preferred or common stock  except to the extent necessary to satisfy the reit qualification requirement that we distribute currently at least of our taxable income 
we currently anticipate that we will meet our financial covenant and incurrence tests based on current revpar expectations 
for  we currently anticipate that our full year portfolio revpar will be between approximately and above the prior year 
other debt 
in late  we were notified that a aaa money market fund in which we had invested approximately million had ceased honoring redemption requests and would liquidate its investments over approximately a six month period 
in order to ensure that our liquidity would not be impaired as a consequence  an affiliate of the fund sponsor provided us with a short term loan at a rate approximately equal to our earnings rate on the fund 
through the date of this filing we have received redemptions aggregating million and the balance remaining on the short term loan was million 
construction loan 
in  we obtained a construction loan to build our royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
we repaid all amounts outstanding on the construction loan in may with proceeds from condominium sales 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we owned interest rate caps with aggregate notional amounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures  and we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that operate three of those hotels referred to as operating joint ventures 
of the remaining joint venture hotels  we own approximately of the lessees operating hotels and one hotel joint venture is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income of unconsolidated entities of million  million  and million including a gain of million related to the sale of two hotels for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations  million of which million was provided from operations  and million of which million was provided from operations for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from the operating lessees 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations or make distributions to our equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  and property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
such costs capitalized in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following o annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  o holding periods  o expected remaining useful lives of assets  o estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and o future capital expenditures 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the hotels that may not be reflected in the hotel s carrying value  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for contingencies 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we had recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the net deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of our million deferred tax asset related to our trss  because of the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting announcements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this statement clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
sfas applies whenever other standards require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas also provides for certain disclosure requirements  including  but not limited to  the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques  if any  during the period 
this statement is effective for us on january   except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  for which the effective date is january  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes ie  unrealized gains and losses in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  sfas allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
this statement is effective for us on january  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this statement is effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests  in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations
