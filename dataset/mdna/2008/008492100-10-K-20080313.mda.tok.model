 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for any tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
effective january   we adopted fin upon adoption and as of december   there was no unrecognized income tax benefit and the adoption of fin had no effect on stockholders equity 
we do not expect any significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to changes in tax positions within one year of december  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
at january  and december   we had accrued zero for the payment of tax related interest and penalties and there was no tax interest or penalties recognized in the statements of operations for the three years ended december  our federal  state and local tax returns for fiscal years remain subject to examination 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability at the measurement date an exit price and not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
this statement also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and consequently a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the statement also clarifies the market participant assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied 
a limited form of retrospective application of sfas no 
is allowed for certain financial instruments 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

this statement permits companies and not for profit organizations to make a one time election to carry eligible types of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  even if fair value measurement is not required under gaap 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  fasb issued statements no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  an amendment to accounting research board no 
sfas s objective is to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
the key aspects of sfas are i the minority interests in subsidiaries should be presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity of the consolidated group  separate from the parent s shareholders equity  ii acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control should be accounted for as equity transactions  iii a parent recognizes a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment  iv the acquirer should attribute net income and each component of other comprehensive income between controlling and noncontrolling interests based on any contractual arrangements or relative ownership interests  and v a reconciliation of beginning to ending total equity is required for both controlling and noncontrolling interests 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and should be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the provisions for sfas to determine the potential impact  if any  the adoption will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items including expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  valuing noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date  and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
sfas no 
r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our accounting for future business combinations once adopted  but we are still currently assessing the impact it will have on the consolidated results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
for example  significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to revenue recognition  capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
minimum rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants 
certain leases provide for additional percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes 
these percentage rents are recognized when determinable by us 
in addition  leases for certain tenants contain rent escalations and or free rent during the first several months of the lease term  however such amounts are not material 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 
we evaluate real estate for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to fair value 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded

we intend to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the leasing and improvement of the properties  through cash flow provided by operations and the line of credit and the credit facility 
we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements for at least the next months 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
we intend to incur additional debt in a manner consistent with our policy of maintaining a ratio of total debt including construction and acquisition financing to total market capitalization of or less 
as of december   our ratio of indebtedness to market capitalization was approximately 
we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
during the quarter ended december   we declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share 
the dividend was paid on january  to holders of record on december  as of december   we had total mortgage indebtedness of  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the mortgage debt is all fixed rate  self amortizing debt 
in addition  the operating partnership has in place a million credit facility the credit facility with bank of america  as the agent  which is guaranteed by the company

advances under the credit facility bear interest within a range of one month to twelve month libor plus basis points to basis points or the lender s prime rate  at our option  based on certain factors such as the ratio of our indebtedness to the capital value of our properties

we plan to begin construction of additional pre leased developments and may acquire additional properties  which will initially be financed by the credit facility and line of credit 
we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt and or equity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditure or capital resources 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo  our presentation of ffo is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measure of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definition 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of ffo and net income for the years ended december   and year ended december  net income depreciation of real estate assets amortization of leasing costs minority interest gain on sale of assets funds from operations weighted average shares and op units outstanding basic diluted item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt  by year of expected maturity  to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at  and  for fixed rate debt and variable rate debt  respectively  as of december  the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
we do not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
as of december   a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
