item business description of business penford corporation which  together with its subsidiary companies  is referred to herein as penford or the company is a developer  manufacturer and marketer of specialty natural based ingredient systems for many industrial and food applications 
the company s strategically located manufacturing facilities in the united states  australia and new zealand provide it with broad geographic coverage of its target markets 
penford is a washington corporation originally incorporated in september the company commenced operations as a publicly traded company on march  
table of contents penford operates in three business segments  each utilizing its carbohydrate chemistry expertise to develop starch based ingredients for value added applications in several end markets that improve the quality and performance of customers products  including papermaking and food products 
the first two  industrial ingredients and food ingredients  are broad categories of end market users  primarily served by the company s united states operations 
the third segment consists of geographically separate operations in australia and new zealand 
the australian and new zealand operations are engaged primarily in the food ingredients business 
financial information about penford s segments and geographic areas is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has extensive research and development capabilities  which are used in understanding the complex chemistry of carbohydrate based materials and in developing applications to address customer needs 
penford s three business segments are industrial ingredients north america  which in fiscal years and generated approximately and  respectively  of penford s revenue  is a supplier of chemically modified specialty starches to the paper and packaging industries 
through a commitment to research and development  industrial ingredients develops customized product applications that help its customers realize improved manufacturing efficiencies and advancements in product performance 
industrial ingredients has specialty processing capabilities for a variety of modified starches 
specialty products for industrial applications are designed to improve the strength and performance of customers products and efficiencies in the manufacture of coated and uncoated paper and paper packaging products 
these starches are principally ethylated chemically modified with ethylene oxide  oxidized treated with sodium hypochlorite and cationic carrying a positive electrical charge 
ethylated and oxidized starches are used in coatings and as binders  providing strength and printability to fine white  magazine and catalog paper 
cationic and other liquid starches are generally used in the paper forming process in paper production  providing strong bonding of paper fibers and other ingredients 
several of industrial ingredients products are cost effective alternatives to synthetic  petroleum based ingredients 
in may  the company s industrial ingredients north america segment began commercial production and sales of ethanol from its facility in cedar rapids  iowa 
this ethanol plant gave the company the ability to select an additional output choice to capitalize on changing industry conditions and selling opportunities 
on june   the company s cedar rapids  iowa plant  operated by the industrial ingredients north america business was temporarily shut down due to record flooding of the cedar river and government ordered mandatory evacuation of the plant and surrounding areas 
the company resumed production of certain of its liquid starch products in mid july using its pilot plant facility  which was not heavily damaged by the flood 
by the end of august  the company had begun manufacturing industrial starch in cedar rapids 
during september  the company also resumed the commercial production and sale of ethanol 
by the beginning of october  the company had substantially completed the restoration of the cedar rapids plant and the facility s processing rate had reached pre flood levels 
food ingredients north america  which in fiscal years and generated approximately and  respectively  of penford s revenue  is a developer and manufacturer of specialty starches and dextrins to the food manufacturing and food service industries 
its expertise is in leveraging the inherent characteristics from potato  corn  tapioca and rice to help improve its customers product performance 
food ingredients specialty starches produced for food applications are used in coatings to provide crispness  improved taste and texture  and increased product life for products such as french fries sold in restaurants 
food grade starch products are also used as moisture binders to reduce fat levels  modify texture and improve color and consistency in a variety of foods such as canned products  sauces  whole and processed meats  dry powdered mixes and other food and bakery products 

table of contents australia new zealand operations generated approximately and of penford s revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
the australia new zealand segment develops  manufactures and markets ingredient systems  including specialty starches and sweeteners for food and industrial applications 
the company believes that it is the sole australian producer of maize starch products 
this segment s flexible manufacturing capabilities allow the company to manufacture products to customer specifications and to quickly respond to customers changing needs 
raw materials corn penford s north american corn wet milling plant is located in cedar rapids  iowa  the middle of the us corn belt 
accordingly  the plant has truck delivered corn available throughout the year from a number of suppliers at prices consistent with those available in the major us grain markets 
penford australia s corn wet milling facilities in lane cove  australia  and auckland  new zealand are sourced through truck delivered corn at contracted prices with regional independent farmers and merchants 
the corn sourced in australia and new zealand is normally contracted prior to harvest march june 
corn used in australia is purchased and stored for use in both the current and following year 
the corn sourced in new zealand is purchased in advance for future delivery 
corn is also purchased from australia as necessary to supplement the corn sourced and processed in new zealand 
potato starch the company s facilities in idaho falls  idaho  richland  washington  and plover  wisconsin use starch recovered as by products from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture modified potato starches 
the company enters into contracts typically having durations of one to five years with potato processors in the united states and canada to acquire potato based raw materials 
wheat products penford australia s tamworth facility uses wheat flour as the primary raw material for the production of its wheat products  including wheat starch  wheat gluten and glucose syrup 
the company is currently negotiating with various suppliers for the supply of wheat flour subsequent to the expiration of its current supply contract at the end of calendar chemicals the primary chemicals used in the manufacturing processes are readily available commodity chemicals 
the prices for these chemicals are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions 
natural gas the primary energy source for most of penford s plants is natural gas 
penford contracts its natural gas supply with regional suppliers  generally under short term supply agreements  and at times uses futures contracts to hedge the price of natural gas in north america 
corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas are not currently subject to availability constraints  although drought conditions in australia have periodically affected the prices of corn and wheat in that area and strong demand has substantially increased the prices of natural gas  chemicals and agricultural raw materials 
penford s current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the available north american supply 
penford estimates that it purchases approximately of the recovered potato starch in north america 
it is possible that  in the long term  continued growth in demand for potato starch based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints 
over half of the company s manufacturing costs consist of the costs of corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas 
the remaining portion consists of the costs of labor  distribution  depreciation and maintenance of manufacturing plant and equipment  and other utilities 
the prices of raw materials may fluctuate  and increases in prices may affect penford s business adversely 
to mitigate this risk  penford hedges a portion of corn and gas purchases with futures and options contracts in the us and enters into short term supply agreements for other production requirements in all locations 
research and development penford s research and development efforts cover a range of projects including technical service work focused on specific customer support projects which require coordination with customers research efforts to develop innovative solutions to specific customer requirements 
these projects are supplemented with longer term  new

product brand names for food ingredient applications include penbind  pencling  penplus  cantab tm  maps tm  mazaca tm and fieldcleer tm 
quarterly fluctuations penford s revenues and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
in particular  the company experiences seasonality in its australian operations 
the company has lower sales volumes and gross margins in australia and new zealand s summer months  which occur during penford s second fiscal quarter 
this seasonal decline is caused by the closure of some customers plants for public holidays and maintenance during this period 
decreased consumption of some foods which use the company s products  such as packaged bread  also contributes to this seasonal trend 
sales volumes of the food ingredients north america products used in french fry coatings are also generally lower during penford s second fiscal quarter due to decreased consumption of french fries during the post holiday season 
the cost of natural gas in north america is generally higher in the winter months than the summer months 
working capital the company s growth is funded through a combination of cash flows from operations and short and long term borrowings 
for more information  see the liquidity and capital resources section under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations in item and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents item a risk factors risks related to penford s business the availability and cost of agricultural products penford purchases are vulnerable to weather and other factors beyond its control 
the company s ability to pass through cost increases for these products is limited by worldwide competition and other factors 
in fiscal  approximately of penford s manufacturing costs were the costs of corn  wheat flour and potato starch 
weather conditions  plantings  government programs and policies  and energy costs and global supply  among other things  have historically caused volatility in the supply and prices of these agricultural products 
for example  in and  growing regions in australia experienced significant droughts  reducing crop yields and increasing acquisition costs for grain raw materials 
due to local and or international competition  particularly in the australia new zealand operations  the company may not be able to pass through the increases in the cost of agricultural raw materials to its customers 
to manage price volatility in the commodity markets  the company may purchase inventory in advance or enter into exchange traded futures or options contracts 
despite these hedging activities  the company may not be successful in limiting its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of agricultural raw materials 
increases in the cost of corn  wheat flour and potato starch due to weather conditions or other factors beyond penford s control and that cannot be passed through to customers will reduce penford s future profitability 
increases in energy and chemical costs may reduce penford s profitability 
energy and chemicals comprised approximately and  respectively  of the cost of manufacturing the company s products in fiscal penford uses natural gas extensively in its industrial ingredients business to dry starch products  and  to a lesser extent  in the other business segments 
the company uses chemicals in all of the businesses to modify starch for specific product applications and customer requirements 
the prices of these inputs to the manufacturing process fluctuate based on anticipated changes in supply and demand  weather and the prices of alternative fuels  including petroleum 
the company may use short term purchase contracts or exchange traded futures or option contracts to reduce the price volatility of natural gas  however  these strategies are not available for the chemicals the company purchases 
if the company is unable to pass on increases in energy and chemical costs to its customers  margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on penford s results of operations 
in fiscal  none of the company s customers constituted more than of sales 
however  the company s largest customer  domtar  inc  represented approximately and of the company s consolidated net sales for fiscal years and  respectively  and sales to the top ten customers represented of consolidated net sales in both and generally  the company does not have multi year sales agreements with its customers 
many customers place orders on an as needed basis and generally can change their suppliers without penalty 
if penford lost one or more major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly reduced its orders  sales and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the company is substantially dependent on its manufacturing facilities  any operational disruption could result in a reduction of the company s sales volumes and could cause it to incur substantial losses 
penford s revenues are and will continue to be derived from the sale of starch based ingredients that the company manufactures at its facilities 
the company s operations may be subject to significant interruption if any of its facilities experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters  as occurred as a result of the flood of the cedar river at the company s cedar rapids  iowa facility in fiscal in addition  the company s operations may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime  or other operational hazards inherent in the industry  such as equipment failures  fires  explosions  abnormal pressures  blowouts  pipeline ruptures  transportation accidents and natural disasters 
some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the company s 
table of contents insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above or that it will be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the agreements governing the company s debt contain various covenants that limit its ability to take certain actions and also require the company to meet financial maintenance tests  and penford s failure to comply with any of the debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the agreements governing penford s outstanding debt contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  limit its ability to incur additional debt or liens  consolidate or merge with any person or transfer or sell all or substantially all of its assets  make investments or acquisitions  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility requires it to comply with specific financial ratios and tests  under which it is required to achieve specific financial and operating results 
events beyond the company s control may affect its ability to comply with these provisions 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the company s revolving credit facility 
in the event of any default that is not cured or waived  the company s lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with accrued interest thereon  due and payable  which could permit acceleration of other debt 
if any of the company s debt is accelerated  there is no assurance that the company would have sufficient assets to repay that debt or that it would be able to refinance that debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
changes in interest rates may affect penford s profitability 
although the company has fixed the interest rates on a significant portion of its outstanding debt through interest rate swaps as of august   approximately million of its outstanding debt  including amounts outstanding under the australian grain inventory financing facility  was subject to variable interest rates which move in direct relation to the united states or australian london interbank offered rate libor  the australian bank bill rate bbsy  or the prime rate in the united states  depending on the selection of borrowing options 
any significant changes in these interest rates would materially affect the company s profitability by increasing or decreasing its borrowing costs 
unanticipated changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect penford s profitability 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states  australia and new zealand 
the company s effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
although the company believes it has complied with all applicable income tax laws  there is no assurance that a tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law or that any additional taxes imposed as a result of tax audits will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents fluctuations in the relative value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect penford s revenues and profitability 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates 
the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has been generally in decline in recent years 
in fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies 
pension expense and the funding of pension obligations are affected by factors outside the company s control  including the performance of plan assets  interest rates  actuarial data and experience  and changes in laws and regulations 
the future funding obligations for the company s two us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service depend upon the level of benefits provided for by the plans  the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans  the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels  actuarial data and experience and any changes in government laws and regulations 
the pension plans hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities 
when the values of these securities decline  pension expense can increase and materially affect the company s results 
decreases in interest rates that are not offset by contributions and asset returns could also increase the company s obligations under such plans 
the company is legally required to make contributions to the pension plans in the future  and those contributions could be material 
the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans during fiscal penford s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other contingencies 
the company faces risks arising from litigation matters in which various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities  such as final adverse judgments  significant settlements or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse outcome  ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
penford has foreign operations  which exposes it to the risks of doing business abroad 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from its operations in australia and new zealand 
these foreign operations subject the company to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside the united states  including the following currency fluctuations  transportation delays and interruptions  political  social and economic instability and disruptions  government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions  the imposition of duties  tariffs and other trade barriers  import and export controls  labor unrest and changing regulatory environments  limitations on the company s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s operations have not been materially affected by any such factors to date  no assurance can be given that its operations may not be adversely affected in the future 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the company s operations in the future by reducing the demand for its products  decreasing the prices at which the company can sell its products or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect the company s access to capital  cost of capital and business operations 
recently  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
if these conditions continue or become worse  the company s future cost of debt and equity capital and its access to capital markets could be adversely affected 
any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force the company to self fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some opportunities  potentially harming its financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
economic conditions may impair the businesses of the company s customers and end user markets  which could adversely affect the company s business operations 
as a result of the current economic downturn and macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  the businesses of some of the company s customers may not be successful in generating sufficient revenues 
customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases from the company until the economy and their businesses strengthen 
in this connection  the company s industrial ingredients business is dependent upon end markets for paper and ethanol in north america 
paper markets have been under competitive pressure from imports and over capacity and may be further stressed by an economic downturn 
ethanol markets have been under pressure from declining oil prices and increasing ethanol production capacity in the united states 
decisions by current or future customers to forego or defer purchases and or customers inability to pay the company for its products may adversely affect the company s earnings and cash flow 
penford depends on its senior management team  the loss of any member could adversely affect its operations 
penford s success depends on the management and leadership skills of its senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals  particularly thomas d 
malkoski  the company s president and chief executive officer  or steven o 
cordier  the company s chief financial officer  or the company s inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel  could prevent it from fully implementing its business strategy 
there is no assurance that it will be able to retain its existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
penford is subject to stringent environmental and health and safety laws  which may require it to incur substantial compliance and remediation costs  thereby reducing profits 
penford is subject to many federal  state  local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the use  handling  treatment  storage  discharge and disposal of substances and hazardous wastes used or generated in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the company s business 
penford has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the company s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
the company may be required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of property  including property where it has disposed of its waste  and for addressing environmental conditions

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of the current facts and circumstances 
management believes that its estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  the financial statements will be affected 
management has reviewed the accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill self insurance program income taxes stock based compensation a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect 
penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience  known troubled accounts  industry trends  economic conditions  how recently payments have been received  and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
if the estimates do not reflect the company s future ability to collect outstanding invoices  penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established 
at august   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million 
hedging activities penford uses derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded futures contracts  to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states 
the company relies upon exchange settlement to address the default risk exposure 
penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges 
this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
to reduce exposure to variable short term interest rates  penford uses interest rate swap agreements 
penford uses over the counter interest rate swap agreements with large commercial banks as counterparties 
the company is unaware of any events or circumstances that would prevent these banks from fulfilling their obligations 
the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analyses to qualify as hedges as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

these judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if the company were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas no

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million representing the ineffectiveness on cash flow hedge transactions related to the purchase of corn and natural gas 
derivative positions held that were forecasted to hedge commodity exposures during the time the cedar rapids manufacturing facility was shut down were no longer deemed to be effective 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
benefit plans penford has defined benefit plans for its us employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified third party actuaries assist management in determining the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
management makes several estimates and assumptions in order to measure the expense and funded status  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on plan assets  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  and increases in the cost of medical care 
the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in the company s future results of operations 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see defined benefit plans below 
valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess  on an annual basis  whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on the company s estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business units 
if future operating results differ materially from the estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to august   the company s share price has periodically traded below book value per share 
during fiscal  the company s australia new zealand business reported lower quarterly margins and operating income than previous years 
the excess of the fair value of the equity of the australia new zealand reporting unit over its carrying value at june  declined from the prior year 
the company continues to monitor and evaluate the financial performance of the australia new zealand business as well as the impact from recent economic events to assess the potential for the fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its book value 
self insurance program the company maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation and group health liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions 
the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities 
income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
the company s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as australian and new zealand  taxing jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances  and the company s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
prior to fiscal  in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  the company established an accrual  when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  
table of contents management believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable 
when facts and circumstances changed  these accruals were adjusted 
beginning in fiscal  the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because the company is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the various tax filing positions 
management believes that the judgments and estimates it uses in evaluating its tax filing positions are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to significant gains and losses and the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
stock based compensation beginning september   the company recognizes stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  the risk free interest rate  dividends and expected option life 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change  and the company uses different assumptions for volatility  interest  dividends and option life in estimating the fair value of stock based awards granted in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimated 
therefore  if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from those estimated  the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
contractual obligations as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt and lease agreements at august  that contractually commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
the purchase obligations at august  represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations through the company s normal course of business for commitments to purchase goods and services for production and inventory needs  such as raw materials  supplies  manufacturing arrangements  capital expenditures and maintenance 
the majority of terms allow the company or suppliers the option to cancel or adjust the requirements based on business needs 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments at august  in thousands after total long term debt and capital lease obligations short term borrowings postretirement medical operating lease obligations  net purchase obligations estimated contributions to the unfunded postretirement medical plan made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for participants through fiscal based on actuarial assumptions

defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans penford maintains defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit postretirement health care plans in the united states 
the most significant assumptions used to determine benefit expense and benefit obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used by penford 
the discount rate used by the company in determining benefit expense and benefit obligations reflects the yield of high quality aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments 
benefit obligations and expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in  and reflect the changes in bond yields over the past several years 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase pension expense by approximately million and other postretirement benefit expense by million 
during fiscal  bond yields rose and penford has increased the discount rate for calculating its benefit obligations at august   as well as net periodic expense for fiscal  to the expected long term return on assets assumption for the pension plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
pension expense increases as the expected return on plan assets decreases 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term historical market rates of return as well as actual returns on the company s plan assets  and adjusts this information to reflect expected capital market trends 
penford also considers forward looking return expectations by asset class  the contribution of active management and management fees paid by the plans 
the plan assets are held in qualified trusts and anticipated rates of return are not reduced for income taxes 
the expected long term return on assets assumption used to calculate net periodic pension expense was for fiscal a basis point decrease increase in the expected return on assets assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million based on plan assets at august  the expected return on plan assets used in calculating fiscal pension expense is 
unrecognized net loss amounts reflect the difference between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
unrecognized net losses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of active employees 
as of august   unrecognized losses from all sources are million for the pension plans and no unrecognized losses for the postretirement health care plan 
amortization of unrecognized net loss amounts is expected to increase net pension expense by approximately million in fiscal amortization of unrecognized net losses is not expected to affect the net postretirement health care expense in fiscal penford recognized pension expense of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
penford expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal the company contributed million  million and million to the pension plans in fiscal years  and  respectively 
penford estimates that it will be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans of million during fiscal because of the recent decline in general economic and capital market conditions  the company expects that pension plan funding contributions will increase over the medium and long term 
the company estimates that the minimum pension plan funding contribution for its plan year calendar year will be million with million to be paid in fiscal  million to be paid in fiscal and million to be paid in september fiscal 
table of contents the company recognized benefit expense for its postretirement health care plan of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
penford expects to recognize approximately million in postretirement health care benefit expense in fiscal the company contributed million  million  and million in fiscal years  and to the postretirement health care plans and estimates that it will contribute million in fiscal future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various assumptions related to the participants in the defined benefit plans will affect future benefit expense and liabilities 
the company cannot predict what these changes will be
