item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this form k and item a risk factors on pages through of this annual report 
overview despite the turmoil of the us economy and financial markets  we delivered our sixth consecutive year of double digit revenue and earnings growth in fiscal  driven by new product launches and market and market share expansions in certain product families in our diagnostics operating segments 
our diagnostics operating segments continue to provide the largest share of consolidated revenues    and for fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  we launched four new diagnostic tests on our recently developed and patented tru rapid test technology 
revenues for our four major infectious disease categories  c 
difficile  h 
pylori  upper respiratory and foodborne  all grew at double digit rates during fiscal as we look forward  we continue to see growth opportunities in the c 
difficile and h 
pylori testing markets where such markets are well established and we hold market leadership positions 
the c 
difficile market has experienced more virulent strains of this toxin and heightened focus by hospitals on this dangerous pathogen 
new aga guidelines are creating increased focus on direct antigen testing for h 
pylori  as this infection is a known cause of ulcers 
our managed care efforts are also expected to continue to contribute to volume growth in h 
pylori products 
our line of patented h 
pylori products includes two direct testing formats 
we also expect to see growth in molecular technologies  with new product launches planned for fiscal  including our new molecular illumigene tm c 
difficile test 
we have successfully completed our fda pre submission activities and expect to initiate clinical trials in january with a k application to follow within days thereafter 
international revenues are likely in the second half of fiscal  with us sales to follow fda clearance 
we also see growth opportunities in our other two major infectious disease markets  upper respiratory and foodborne 
in the foodborne market  we intend to develop and launch other infectious disease products that will complement our existing e 
coli products 
in the upper respiratory market  we expect to see market share gains from the penetration of our recently developed and launched influenza and respiratory syncytial virus products using our patented tru rapid test technology  as well as improvements in gross margins related to our internally developed tests 
revenues for our life science operating segment were disappointing in fiscal as they were lower than fiscal this reduction was primarily due to demand and buying patterns of certain of our bulk viral protein and reagent customers 
at this time  we believe such demand and buying patterns have reached a point where we do not expect any further year over year revenue reductions 

table of contents financial discipline continues to be one of our fundamental principles in running the day to day business 
the following table illustrates key income and expense elements as a percentage of sales 
we look for continued improvement in each of these measures each year  in spite of macro economic market conditions 
gross profit operating expenses operating income preservation of the capital of our investment portfolio is also a fundamental principle in our cash management philosophy 
during october  we moved substantially all of our investments in municipal variable rate demand notes to institutional money market mutual funds invested in either us treasuries  or repurchase agreements collateralized by us treasuries 
existing investments in institutional tax exempt money market mutual funds are covered under the us treasury s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
this program provides a guarantee to money market mutual fund shareholders of per share net asset value for funds invested as of september   if the fund were to liquidate its assets as a result of its net asset value falling below 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
operating segments our reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics  and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  and boca raton  florida  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science operating segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics operating segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science operating segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues 

table of contents results of operations fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to  or per diluted share increased from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiency across all businesses 
net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  an increase of  or compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales for the us diagnostics operating segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and benefited from volume increases in influenza and respiratory syncitial virus products in advance of the upper respiratory season in the amount of approximately  the early start to the season was driven by the timing of promotions offered by a third party manufacturer of certain products  which are passed along to our customers 
we expect that the us diagnostics operating segment s sales of these products during the first quarter of fiscal will be flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the timing of this third party manufacturer promotion 
we ultimately measure our growth and level of success for upper respiratory products based on the full selling season  which typically runs from august through march  also taking into consideration the relative strength of the season 
net sales for our european diagnostics and life science operating segments increased and decreased  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal year net earnings for fiscal increased to  or per diluted share increased from net earnings for fiscal of  or per diluted share including the tax benefit of  described below 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal are discussed below 
net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal include the effects of a tax benefit in the amount of  or per basic and diluted share  related to a discrete adjustment to tax reserves that was recorded in the third quarter upon the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain income tax returns see note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
the tables below provide information on net earnings  basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  excluding this tax benefit  as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because these measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the favorable impact of a discrete material item that is not expected to recur in the future  and 
table of contents these measures are used by our management for various purposes  including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets  comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors  and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting

effective july   we changed our method of accounting for this inventory from the lifo method to the fifo method  and now substantially all of our inventories are reflected at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the fifo method 
we changed to the fifo method for these inventories because it conforms substantially all of our worldwide inventories to a consistent basis of accounting  and it provides better comparability to our industry peers  many of whom use the fifo method of accounting for inventories 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

difficile  h 
pylori  upper respiratory and foodborne in both fiscal and each of these product families experienced double digit growth rates in fiscal and new product sales contributions in fiscal came from our upper respiratory tru products for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus launched in the first quarter of fiscal  and our immunocard stat ehec product launched in fiscal the ehec product was developed in collaboration with merck for detection of toxin producing e 
coli in patients that may have ingested contaminated produce or meat products 
we also saw market share expansions in fiscal and in infectious diseases where we have established leadership positions  c

two national distributors accounted for  and of total third party sales for the us diagnostics operating segment for fiscal   and  respectively 
the upper respiratory season was relatively strong  which also contributed to the volume growth in influenza and respiratory syncytial virus products during the first half of fiscal although we cannot predict the strength of the upper respiratory season and its impact on sales volumes  to date  we have experienced healthy orders for our upper respiratory products

fiscal sales for the life science operating segment reflect changes in demand and buying patterns of certain of our major diagnostic manufacturing customers and non renewal of a supply contract with the us department of defense 
changes in the us department of defense s critical reagents program led to non renewal of this contract after fiscal fiscal sales for the life science operating segment reflect volume growth in make to order bulk antigens and antibodies  offset by lower sales activity from contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
we sell three main products to a major diagnostic manufacturing customer  who accounted for   and of total sales for the life science operating segment for fiscal  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  this customer reduced its forecasted requirements for two antigen products due to its internal inventory management initiatives and its market factors 
the impact of this reduction was partially offset by the customer s increased purchases of a bulk reagent product

our overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points

the increase in research and development expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment during fiscal reflects additional salaries and benefits related to a new vice president hired in may  planned staff headcount additions  and development costs for our illumigene tm molecular technology and other products in development 
these increases were partially offset by decreased professional fees and clinical trial costs related to new products which were launched during the first fiscal quarter of the increase in research and development expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment during fiscal were primarily attributable to clinical trial and other costs associated with new product development  including planned headcount additions  as well as increased stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the life science operating segment during fiscal primarily related to retirements of staff personnel that occurred during fiscal and lower incentive compensation 
selling and marketing expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment for fiscal increased primarily due to costs for new product launches  increased salaries and benefits related to planned headcount additions  and higher incentive compensation from sales growth 
the decrease for the us diagnostics operating segment for fiscal was primarily attributable to lower costs for sales promotions  advertising  and distributor incentives  offset by increased salaries and benefits related to headcount additions and stock based 
table of contents compensation costs 
selling and marketing expenses for the european diagnostics operating segment increased primarily as a result of fluctuations in the euro currency for both fiscal and  and one planned headcount addition in fiscal the decrease in selling and marketing expenses for the life science operating segment for fiscal primarily related to lower incentive compensation and staff reductions 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal for the us diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to reduced incentive compensation costs  both corporate incentive bonus and stock based compensation 
these decreases were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to planned headcount additions 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment for fiscal was primarily attributable to higher costs for stock based compensation  an insurance recovery in fiscal  and increased salaries and benefits  including the effects of planned headcount additions 
the increase for the life science operating segment for fiscal reflects severance costs for certain personnel changes and increased salaries and benefits 
the decrease for the life science operating segment for fiscal was primarily attributable to the impairment of the supply contract with the united states department of defense 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the increase for the european diagnostics operating segment for fiscal was primarily attributable to currency fluctuations  as well as increased salaries and benefits 
the decrease for the european diagnostics operating segment for fiscal was primarily attributable to expenses connected with an employee matter in fiscal  which were covered by the aforementioned insurance recovery

during november  we granted to certain employees stock options that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for fiscal because meridian s fiscal net earnings did not reach the minimum level  these stock options were not earned 
no stock based compensation has been recorded for these options 
similarly  during november  we granted to certain employees stock options that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for fiscal because meridian s fiscal net earnings surpassed the minimum level  these stock options were earned and are now exercisable over a vesting period 
operating income operating income increased and in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 

table of contents other income and expense interest income was   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease during fiscal was driven by lower interest yields in the current interest rate environment  somewhat offset by higher average investment balances

income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
both the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal and the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal were primarily attributable to a discrete adjustment to tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal in the amount of  this discrete adjustment reduced the effective tax rate for fiscal by points

fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions  assuming full knowledge of all relevant facts by the applicable tax authorities 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin   was charged to opening retained earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  or liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
this credit facility has been supplemented by the proceeds from a september common share offering  which during the course of fiscal  were invested in fixed income securities such 
table of contents as overnight repurchase agreements  institutional money market mutual funds  municipal variable rate demand notes with a seven day put feature and tax exempt auction rate securities 
we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as a result of current conditions in the financial markets  during october  we moved substantially all of our investments in municipal variable rate demand notes to institutional money market mutual funds invested in either us treasuries  or repurchase agreements collateralized by us treasuries 
existing investments in institutional tax exempt money market mutual funds are covered under the us treasury s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
this program provides a guarantee to money market mutual fund shareholders of per share net asset value for funds invested as of september   if the fund were to liquidate its assets as a result of its net asset value falling below 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities 
we also have additional sources of liquidity through our investment portfolio and  bank credit facility  if needed 
to date  we have not experienced any significant deterioration in the aging of our customer accounts receivable nor in our vendors ability to supply raw materials and services and extend normal credit terms 
our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectability of our customer accounts receivable  impact credit terms with our vendors or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 
overall stock market valuations have significantly declined in recent months  which may raise questions around the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
despite the overall decline in stock market valuations  as of october   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of as of september  this relationship  stock price trading at x book value  is an indicator that the decline in overall stock market valuations  and its impact on our stock price  has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets

net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in dividend payments  offset by  in additional proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
dividend payments in fiscal reflect increased dividend rates and common shares outstanding related to stock option exercises 
net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements and dividends during the next twelve months 
capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility

student loan auction rate securities our investment portfolio includes student loan auction rate securities with a par value amount of  which are long term student loan revenue bonds whose interest rates are reset every days via a dutch auction process 
all of our auction rate securities are backed by pools of student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
ffelp student loans are guaranteed by state guarantors who have reinsurance agreements with the us department of education 
all of our student loan auction rate securities were rated aaa and aaa by moody s and standard poor s  respectively  at the time of purchase  and have continued to maintain these credit ratings through the present time 
the dutch auction process historically provided the necessary liquidity mechanism to either purchase or sell these securities 
beginning in mid february  liquidity issues in the us credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions across a broad spectrum of tax exempt securities  including student loan revenue bonds 
auctions for the student loan revenue bonds that we hold have continued to fail through the present time 
the consequence of a failed auction is that we do not have access to the principal amount of our investments 
issuers are still required to make interest payments when due in the event of failed auctions 
we have not experienced any missed interest payments to date 
our most recent interest payment date was november  our auction rate securities were purchased through ubs financial services  inc during november  we accepted an offer from ubs  ag ubs of auction rate security rights 
these rights permit us to require ubs between june  and july  the exercise period to purchase our auction rate securities at par value 
in exchange  ubs is granted the right  at their sole discretion  to sell or otherwise dispose of our auction rate security investments until july  as long as we receive a payment of par value upon the sale or disposition 
in addition  the rights permit us to establish a demand revolving credit line in an amount equal to the par value of the securities at a net no cost 
we are still able to sell the auction rate securities on our own  but in such a circumstance  we would lose the par value support from ubs 
as of september   the carrying value of our auction rate securities was reduced by  we consider this adjustment to be temporary under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and accordingly  it has been recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
this adjustment was based upon a valuation prepared by an independent appraisal firm 
our investments in student loan auction rate securities are included in other long term assets in the 
table of contents accompanying consolidated balance sheet based on the maturities of the student loan revenue bonds to 
we do not believe that the recent auction failures and our inability to liquidate these investments for some period of time will have any material impact on our ability to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures  dividend payments  acquisitions  if any  or other business requirements

meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
oem concepts earnout obligation is contingent upon future calendar year sales and gross profit of oem concepts products through december  as of september   our fin liability and fin net interest payable were  and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 

table of contents other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
during october  meridian entered into a license agreement with eiken chemical co  ltd  that provides rights to eiken s loop mediated isothermal amplification technology for infectious disease testing in the united states and other geographic markets 
the agreement calls for payments of up to  japanese yen approximately  based on the achievement of certain milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
payments made during product development are expected to occur over a five year period  which began in fiscal a payment equal to  japanese yen or  was made during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began seeking recovery of approximately  of past royalties paid and interest under a license agreement around certain rapid diagnostic testing technology 
this license agreement covered patent rights that were narrowed in scope via other litigation with the licensor that did not involve meridian 
we strongly believe that the licensed patent  as reissued  does not cover any of our products 
we also ceased further royalty payments under this license agreement 
the licensor to this agreement disputes our position that the patent  as reissued  does not cover our products 
although we believe that our position is very strong  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for on going royalties  if any  nor has any accrual or income been recorded for recovery of past royalties paid 
derivative financial instruments meridian accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and therefore  the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for the ineffective portion of the hedge  gains or losses are charged to earnings in the current period 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
meridian is exposed to foreign currency risk related to its european distribution operations  including foreign currency denominated intercompany sales and receivables 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge cash flows from intercompany sales between our us parent company and its italian affiliate 
the counterparties to these contracts are commercial banks 
hedging activities are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
management estimates rebate accruals based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
life science revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services or custom manufacturing  or multiple deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing both contract research and development services and contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  using the principles in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the framework in eitf is based on each of the multiple deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate fair values 
fair values are determined via consistent pricing between standalone arrangements and multiple deliverable arrangements  as well as a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis pursuant to the satisfaction of criteria in sec staff accounting bulletins nos 
and related to bill and hold revenue recognition 
inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 

table of contents intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
during fiscal  meridian determined that the carrying value of a supply contract related to the life science operating segment had become impaired and recorded such impairment in the amount of  to general and administrative expenses 
the contract provided for the supply of biological materials to the united states department of defense 
changes in the department s critical reagents program lowered the amount of materials to be supplied under the contract and ultimately led to the contract having a shorter life than originally expected 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal or indicating that the carrying value of other such assets may not be recoverable 
our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  impairment of intangible assets could take place 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 

table of contents income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
effective october   we adopted fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions  assuming full knowledge of all relevant facts by the applicable tax authorities 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin   was charged to opening retained earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our italian subsidiary are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiary 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally in italy 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the passing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operation
