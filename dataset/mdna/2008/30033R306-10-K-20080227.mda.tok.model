executive overview we develop  manufacture and market solar panels utilizing our proprietary string ribbon tm technology 
string ribbon technology is a cost effective process for manufacturing ribbons of crystalline silicon that are then cut into wafers 
these wafers are the primary components of photovoltaic  or pv  cells which  in turn  are used to produce solar panels 
we believe that our proprietary and patented technologies  combined with our integrated manufacturing process know how  offer significant cost and manufacturing advantages over competing polysilicon based pv technologies 
with silicon consumption of less than five grams per watt  we believe we are the industry leader in efficient polysilicon consumption and use approximately of the silicon used by conventional sawing wafer production processes 
through intensive research and design efforts we have significantly enhanced our string ribbon technology and our ability to manufacture crystalline silicon wafers by developing a quad ribbon wafer furnace  which enables us to grow four silicon ribbons from one furnace compared to two silicon ribbons grown with our dual ribbon furnace presently in use in our prototype facility in marlboro  massachusetts 
our quad ribbon furnace incorporates a state of the art automated ribbon cutting technology that we expect will improve our manufacturing process when it is used in our future factories 
we have used quad ribbon furnaces to produce a limited quantity of solar panels in our marlboro facility which have been sold to our distribution partners and will use quad furnaces in our new manufacturing facility in devens  massachusetts 
our revenues today are primarily derived from the sale of solar panels  which are assemblies of pv cells that have been electrically interconnected and laminated in a physically durable and weather tight package 
we sell our products using distributors  systems integrators and other value added resellers  who often add value through system design by incorporating our panels with electronics  structures and wiring systems 
the primary applications for our current products is on grid generation  in which supplemental electricity is provided to an electric utility grid  but has in the past and is expected in the future to include off grid generation for markets where access to conventional electric power is not economical or physically feasible 
our products are currently sold primarily in the united states  germany and korea 
we began construction in devens  massachusetts in september and expect to begin production of solar panels there in mid upon reaching full production capacity in devens i  which we expect to take place in early  devens i is expected to increase our current manufacturing capacity of mw by approximately mw 
in addition  devens ii  which is expected to add a second production line in early  should increase our production capacity at the devens facility to approximately mw by late our string ribbon technology is also used by everq  which has grown its annual production capacity to approximately mw as of december  everq is currently planning to expand its annual manufacturing capacity to mw by using our quad ribbon wafer furnaces 

table of contents in connection with our manufacturing expansion plans  we have entered into multi year polysilicon supply agreements and multi year panel sales agreements 
under our silicon supply agreements with dc chemical  wacker  nitol and silpro  including an agreement entered into with dc chemical in january  we have silicon under contract to reach annual production levels of approximately mw in  mw in  mw in and mw in we plan to expand our manufacturing operations accordingly 
the combined production of our marlboro facility  devens i and devens ii and everq will be used to satisfy the requirements of the sales agreements that we have entered with six customers  including for the sale of approximately million in solar panels over the next four years 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock  which included the exercise of an underwriters option to purchase million additional shares 
we received net proceeds of approximately million net of underwriting discounts 
the shares of common stock were sold at a per share price to the public of 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our planned capital programs and to fund our operating expenditures over the next twelve months  including the completion of construction of devens i in mid and the development of devens ii beginning in march of we will be required to raise additional capital to provide further funding to complete devens ii  secure raw materials or necessary technologies 
we do not know whether we will be able to raise additional financing or whether we will be able to do so on terms favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if applicable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for everq on december   we became equal partners in everq with q cells and rec and now share equally in its prospective net income or loss 
as a result of our reduction in ownership to one third  we are required to account for our interest in everq under the equity method of accounting  as opposed to consolidating the operating results of everq as we had in the past 
under the equity method of accounting  we report our one third share of everq s net income or loss as a single line item in our statement of operations and our investment in everq as a single line item in our balance sheet 
we began applying the equity method with respect to everq on december  we market and sell all solar panels manufactured by everq under the evergreen solar brand  as well as manage customer relationships and contracts 
we receive fees from everq and no longer consolidate their gross revenue or cost of goods sold resulting from the sale of everq s solar panels 
during  we received a fee of of gross everq revenue relating to the sales and marketing of solar panels 
in addition  we received royalty payments for our ongoing technology agreement with everq 
taken together  the sales and marketing fee and royalty payments totaled approximately of gross everq revenue for fiscal we also received payments from everq of approximately million in fiscal to reimburse us for certain research and development and other support costs we incurred that could benefit everq 
income statement classification of these research and development reimbursement payments depend on how we are reimbursed 

table of contents a best efforts arrangement allows for the reimbursement to offset expenses whereas a specific performance arrangement requires us to record both revenue and an offsetting cost of revenue 
these reimbursements in fiscal were best efforts in nature and therefore are shown as a reduction of our expenses 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize product revenue if there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  shipment has occurred  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving 
we currently sell our solar power products primarily to distributors  system integrators and other value added resellers within and outside of north america  who typically resell our products to end users throughout the world 
for new customers requesting credit  we evaluate creditworthiness based on credit applications  feedback from provided references  and credit reports from independent agencies 
for existing customers  we evaluate creditworthiness based on payment history and known changes in their financial condition 
royalty and fee revenue are recognized at contractual rates upon shipment of product by everq 
we also evaluate the facts and circumstances related to each sales transaction and consider whether risk of loss has passed to the customer upon shipment 
we consider whether our customer is purchasing our product for stock  and whether contractual or implied rights to return the product exist or whether our customer has an end user contractually committed 
to date  we have not offered rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  such that their ability to make payments was impaired  additional allowances could be required 
warranty we have provided for estimated future warranty costs of approximately  as of december   representing our best estimate of the likely expense associated with fulfilling our obligations under such warranties 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  in an effort to ensure the quality of our product and reduce our warranty exposure 
our warranty obligation will be effected not only by our product failure rates  but also the costs to repair or replace failed products and potentially service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs  service or delivery costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires entities to measure compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees at fair value and to recognize such cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
we selected the modified prospective method for implementing sfas r and began applying the provisions to stock based awards granted on or after january   plus any unvested awards granted prior to january  total equity compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and  was approximately million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the awards service periods  which are the vesting periods  less estimated forfeitures 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas r pro forma disclosures for prior periods 
during and  we granted  shares and  shares  respectively  of performance based restricted stock  all of which immediately vest upon the achievement of specific financial performance targets 
table of contents prior to and  respectively 
we have assumed that none of these performance based awards will vest and accordingly have not provided for compensation expense associated with the awards 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of reaching the performance requirements and will be required to recognize compensation expense of approximately million associated with these performance based awards if such awards should vest 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
certain factors may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
estimates of reserves are made for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we consider lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 
impairment of long lived assets our policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
if such a test indicates that an impairment exists  then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan that includes further reducing our manufacturing costs and significantly increasing sales 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
results of operations description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues 
our total revenues consist of revenues from the sale of products  royalty revenue associated with our ongoing technology agreement with everq  and fees from everq for our marketing and selling activities associated with sales of product manufactured by everq under the evergreen solar brand 
product 
table of contents revenues consist of revenues primarily from the sale of solar cells  panels and systems 
reported product revenues represented  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
as a result of our reduction in ownership in everq to one third on december   we have applied the equity method of accounting for our share of everq results from december  forward 
due to this transition  a significant portion of our product revenue is generated from united state customers 
international product sales accounted for approximately  and of total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of material expenses  salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation  depreciation expense  maintenance  rent and other support expenses associated with the manufacture of our solar power products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation costs  consulting expenses and prototype costs related to the design  engineering  development  testing and enhancement of our products  manufacturing equipment and manufacturing technology 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
we also may receive payments from everq and other third parties as reimbursement of certain research and development costs we will incur 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic objectives of enhancing our technology  reducing manufacturing costs and meeting the changing requirements of our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation costs  employee recruiting costs  accounting and legal fees  rent  insurance and other selling and administrative expenses 
we expect that selling expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales efforts to support our anticipated growth  hire additional sales personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
facility start up 
facility startup expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and costs of operating a new facility before it has been qualified for full production 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant expansion program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we expect to incur significant facility start up expenses as we continue to plan  construct and qualify new facilities  including costs associated with our new facility currently under construction in massachusetts 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income primarily from interest earned on the holding of short term marketable securities  bond premium amortization or discount accretion  interest expense on outstanding debt and net foreign exchange gains and losses 
equity income from interest in everq 
as of december   we began accounting for our share of everq s results under the equity method of accounting  which requires us to record our one third share of everq s net income or loss as one line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
during the period from december  to december   everq recorded approximately million in net income  of which we recorded approximately  in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   everq recorded approximately million in net income  of which we recorded approximately million in our consolidated statement of operations 
minority interest 
through december   we consolidated the financial results of everq in our financial statements 
through december   everq incurred losses of million  which are consolidated in our financial statements 
however   of those losses represents the portion of everq losses attributable to the q cells and rec minority interests for the period ended december  comparison of years ended december  and through december   we owned of everq and consolidated the financial statements of everq 
as a result of our reduction in ownership in everq to one third on december   we have 
table of contents applied the equity method of accounting for our share of everq s operating results from december  this change in accounting has significantly impacted year over year comparability 
revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in reported revenues is attributable to everq product revenues  which we consolidated with our product revenues through december  but are not consolidated with our product revenues in everq  which began shipping product in  accounted for approximately million of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  the decline in product revenues is partially offset by royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from everq in of approximately million 
in order to efficiently manage worldwide distribution of product based on string ribbon technology  we fulfill orders largely based on geography 
more than half of the product produced at everq is distributed to customers in europe and the majority of the product produced at our marlboro facility is distributed to customers in the united states 
international product revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decline in international revenues is attributable to everq which began product shipments in the second quarter of and now primarily fulfills european customer orders 
as we increase our own capacity  including our new facility in devens  we expect that our worldwide customer geographic mix will become more balanced 
the following table summarizes the concentration of our product revenues by geography and customer by geography united states germany spain all other by customer powerlight sunedison grosolar krannich solartechnik donauer solartechnik all other cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million for the same period in cost of product revenue for the year ended december  included approximately million in costs associated with everq 
none of everq s cost of product revenue is included in our financial statements for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin primarily resulted from the royalty and selling fees earned from everq in the year ended december   in addition to improved operating efficiencies and higher production volumes at our marlboro pilot manufacturing facility and costs allocated to research and development supporting pilot programs 
the main purpose of our marlboro facility is to develop and prototype new manufacturing process technologies which  when developed  will be employed in new factories 
as such  our manufacturing costs 
table of contents incurred in marlboro are substantially burdened by additional engineering costs and also reflect inefficiencies typically inherent in pilot and development operations 
as royalty and selling fees from everq increase in the future as a result of sales volume increases associated with factory expansion  we expect our gross margin to increase as well 
there are no significant incremental sales and marketing costs incurred  or expected to be incurred  in future periods in connection with the sales and marketing agreements with everq 
due to the pilot manufacturing nature of our existing marlboro facility  we do not expect substantial improvement in gross margins generated by product sold from this facility 
we do expect  however  that as we scale to capacity with our new mw factory that product gross margins should improve substantially 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million net of million of reimbursements from everq  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation and related costs  including costs supporting piloting programs  and higher depreciation and operating costs associated with expanded r d facilities 
loss on disposal of fixed assets 
during the year ended december   as a result of the successful introduction of new manufacturing technology  we disposed of equipment with a total net book value of million in order to replace them with more technologically advanced equipment expected to improve the operational performance of our technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million in everq costs  which were approximately million for the year ended december   were included in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   and are not included in the comparable period for this decline was primarily offset by increases in compensation and related costs associated with additional personnel and higher management incentive compensation 
in addition  increased costs associated with marketing communications  including our effort to re brand evergreen with a new logo  and increased insurance and legal costs associated with the growth of our operations and routine regulatory filings were incurred 
as we begin to hire employees and scale operations for our planned expansion  we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will increase in future periods 
facility start up 
facility start up costs for the year ended december  of million were comprised primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and legal costs associated with the construction of our new facility in massachusetts which began in september other income expense net 
other income  net of million for the year ended december  was comprised of  in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income  and million in interest expense 
other income for the period ended december  consisted of million in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
the increase in interest income is attributable to our higher cash balance that resulted from additional capital raised during the year ended december  the decline in interest expense was primarily due to the interest cost associated with the everq loan facility with deutsche bank  which we consolidated with our interest expense for the year ended december  but is not consolidated with our interest expense in the comparable period in in addition  we have higher capitalized interest costs in associated with our on going infrastructure improvement initiatives 
equity income from interest in everq 
the equity income from our interest in everq of million for the year ended december  represents our one third share of everq s net income of million 
everq s increased net income resulted primarily from incremental production volume 
net loss 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in our net loss was due primarily to the royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees earned from everq in of approximately million offset by an overall 
table of contents increase in our marlboro net operating loss as we continue to scale up our operations 
the increase in our other income  net  of approximately million  also contributed to the decline in our net loss 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase in product revenues was due primarily to sales of product manufactured by everq  which began shipping product in and accounted for approximately million of total revenue 
the first everq factory was completed in and reached its full capacity run rate by the fourth quarter of cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase was due to the cost of product revenues associated with production at everq  which accounted for approximately million of total cost of product revenue 
product gross margin for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  the year over year improvement in product gross margin primarily resulted from improving gross margins of everq as manufacturing reached full capacity at its first manufacturing facility 
further improvements in gross margin may result from increases in manufacturing scale and technology improvements 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in approximately of the increase was due to increased labor costs including million of expense related to the adoption of sfas r and approximately of the increase was due to increases in material costs associated with internal initiatives aimed at improving our manufacturing technology 
loss on disposal of fixed assets 
during the year  as a result of the successful introduction of new manufacturing technology  we disposed of existing equipment in order to replace them with more technologically advanced equipment expected to improve operational performance of our technology 
equipment with a total net book value of million was disposed of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in approximately of the increase was due to increased compensation costs associated with additional personnel including million of expense related to the adoption of sfas r  net of terminations  approximately of the increase was due to general and administrative costs incurred by everq which are included in our consolidated statement of operations through december   approximately related to increased legal and accounting expenses and most of the remainder was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred to support the increase in worldwide sales 
other income 
other income for the period ended december  was comprised of million in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
other income for the period ended december  consisted of  in foreign exchange gains   of gain on the sale of a portion of our everq interest to rec  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was due to the larger average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during due to the common stock and subordinated convertible debt financings 
interest expense increased due to interest charges associated with increased debt incurred by everq as well as the impact of a full year s worth of interest expense related to the convertible notes 
net loss 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in net loss was due primarily to the overall increase in net operating losses associated with the scale up of everq operations as well as the impact of recognizing million in expense related to the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through sales of capital stock  issuance of debt and  to a lesser extent  product revenues  and beginning in  fees from everq for our marketing and sale of everq panels and royalty payments for our technology contribution to everq 
research and development expenditures have historically been partially funded by government research contracts 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million which includes our restricted cash on deposit with deutsche bank ag of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from our operations of million  net of non cash charges  increases in inventory levels of million  primarily silicon  in addition to prepaid cost of inventory of million associated with new silicon supply agreements  and increases in other current assets  primarily vat receivables 
these uses were offset by reductions in accounts receivable of approximately million associated with customer payments  and increases in accounts payable of million 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to our loss of million  increases in accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of million  and increases in other current assets of million offset by a net increase in deferred grants funding of million  increases in accrued expenses of million and depreciation expense and losses on fixed assets disposals of million 
in general  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to supporting the increase in working capital requirements of everq as the first manufacturing facility ramped to full production by the end of the third quarter of the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to the net loss of million and an increase in other current assets of million  offset by increases in accounts payable of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and depreciation expense and losses on fixed asset disposals of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was primarily due to purchases of equipment and marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities 
for the year ended december   we deposited approximately million with deutsche bank associated with the guarantee of the everq loan 
in addition  a loan of approximately million was provided to silicium de provence silpro as part of our silicon supply agreement with them 
as of december   we no longer consolidate the balance sheet of everq and therefore  our cash balance at december  excludes everq s cash balances  and the decrease in everq s cash balance is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities 
capital expenditures were million which includes million of deposits for the manufacture of fixed assets  million which includes million of deposits for the manufacture of fixed assets and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and were primarily for equipment needed for our marlboro manufacturing facility and equipment for everq 
the expenditures were primarily for facility improvements and equipment for our marlboro manufacturing facility in addition to expenditures for construction of our new devens  massachusetts manufacturing facility  which will increase our production capacity in massachusetts by approximately mw in two mw phases and increase our employee base to approximately  by mid the commonwealth of massachusetts support program is expected to include up to million in grants  up to million in low interest loans and a low cost  year land lease 
as of december   we had outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
most of our commitments for capital expenditures are associated with our new devens facility and infrastructure improvements and equipment purchases for our marlboro facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net proceeds of  shares of our common stock sold in a public offering at per share and which closed on may  an additional million shares 
table of contents of our common stock were sold to dc chemical for per share in conjunction with a stock purchase agreement 
on april   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank for a credit facility that provides for a million secured revolving line of credit  which may be used to borrow revolving loans or to issue letters of credit on our behalf  and includes a foreign exchange sublimit and cash management services sublimit 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily represents an increase in everq debt through december  and cash received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily represents net proceeds from common stock issued in conjunction with the common stock public offering completed in february as well as the convertible subordinated debt issuance in june in february  we completed a million common stock offering  net of offering costs of approximately million  to satisfy existing capital requirements and to fund the continuing capacity expansion of our marlboro  massachusetts manufacturing and development facilities and the expenditures necessary for the initial build out and initial operation of everq 
for this common stock offering  we issued  shares of our common stock 
the shares of common stock were sold at a per share price of before deducting underwriting discounts 
in june  we issued convertible subordinated notes notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  and we received proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
a portion of the proceeds from the financing was used to increase research and development spending on promising next generation technologies  to explore further expansion opportunities and to fulfill our commitments with everq 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually at the annual rate of 
the notes do not have required principal payments prior to maturity on july  however  the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
on or after july   we may redeem the notes for cash at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on july  and ending on june  beginning on july  and ending on june  on july  we may redeem the notes on or after july  and prior to july  only if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the then current conversion price of the notes for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption 
we may be required to repurchase the notes upon a designated event either a termination of trading or a change in control at a price which will be in cash or  in the case of a change in control  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of both equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued interest 
upon a change in control  we may under certain circumstances be required to pay a premium on redemption which will be a number of additional shares of our common stock as determined by our stock price and the effective date of the change in control 
the notes are subordinate in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt 
we incurred financing costs of approximately million which are being amortized ratably over the seven year term of the notes 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in interest expense associated with the notes  net of capitalized interest of approximately  and  respectively 
everq debt guarantee on april   we entered into a guarantee and undertaking agreement with q cells ag and renewable energy corporation asa in connection with everq entering into a loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by deutsche bank ag the guarantee 
the loan agreement provides everq with aggregate borrowing availability of up to million euros 
pursuant to the guarantee  we along with q cells ag and renewable energy corporation asa  each agreed to guarantee a one third portion of the loan outstanding  up to 
table of contents million euros of everq s repayment obligations under the loan agreement 
as of december   we have million deposited with deutsche bank ag fulfilling our obligation under the guarantee  which is classified as restricted cash in our balance sheet 
upon everq reaching certain milestones  expected to be achieved in the next months  the guarantee will be cancelled 
as of december   the total amount of debt outstanding under the loan agreement was million euros approximately million at december  exchange rates of which million euros was current approximately million at december  exchange rates 
repayment of the loan is due in quarterly installments through september  evergreen solar loans to everq in november  we entered into a shareholder loan agreement to provide everq with a loan totaling million euros 
under the terms of the shareholder loan agreement  the loan carried a fixed interest rate of  had a term of four years and was subordinated to all other outstanding debt of everq 
in addition  during we provided everq with additional loans to help fund the initial financing requirement of the first two factories 
in january  we  rec and q cells entered into a new shareholder loan agreement with everq 
under the terms of the shareholder loan agreement  everq repaid all outstanding shareholder loans  plus accrued interest  in exchange for a new shareholder loan of million euros from each shareholder 
the table below summarizes the principal and terms of our share of this outstanding loan as of december  date of loan principal eur principal usd interest rate date due january    december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our planned capital programs and to fund our operating expenditures over the next twelve months  including the completion of construction of devens i in and the development of devens ii beginning in march of however  the net proceeds from our february public offering of common stock and cash on hand will not be sufficient to fully construct and equip devens ii and  therefore  we will need to secure additional financing to do so  and to secure raw materials or necessary technologies 
we do not know whether we will be able to raise additional financing or whether we will be able to do so on terms favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited
