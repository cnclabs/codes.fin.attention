critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company is in the business of performing drug testing and reporting the results thereof 
the company s drug testing services include training for collection of samples and storage of positive samples for its customers for an agreed upon fee per unit tested of samples 
the revenues are recognized when the predominant deliverable  drug testing  is provided and reported to the customer 
in  the company adopted emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which was effective for all transactions entered into subsequent to june  the company applied the consensus reached under eitf and concluded that the testing  training and storage elements are considered one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes as the training and storage costs are de minimis and do not have stand alone value to the customer 
the company has concluded that the predominant deliverable in the arrangement is the testing of the units and has recognized revenue as that service is performed and reported to the customer 
the company also provides expert testimony  when and if necessary  to support the results of the tests  which is generally billed separately and recognized as the services are provided 
deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of the performance of drug testing procedures  generally in relation to the personal drug testing kits pdt deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the underlying test results are delivered 
with respect to a portion of these transactions  there may be instances where the customer ultimately does not require performance 
revenue is then recognized when the company can reasonably  reliably and objectively determine that it is remote that performance will be required for an estimable portion of transactions 
the company recorded  and  of revenue in the results of operations for the years ended december  and related to test kits that were sold for which the company s obligations to provide service were deemed remote 
no such amounts were recorded in estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  including bad debts and income taxes  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of its customer accounts 
management reviews its accounts receivable aging for doubtful accounts and specifically identifies accounts that may not be collectible 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and  as a consequence  believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
the company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
bad debt expense has been within management s expectations 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the company to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company had net deferred tax assets in the amount of  at december   which the company believes are fully realizable based upon expected future taxable income  which the company s believes is reasonably attainable in light of previous operating results during the past three years 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on an audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes 
the company adopted the provisions of fin  effective january   without material effect in the financial statements 
the company s evaluation was performed for the tax years ended december    and  the tax years which remained subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of january  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits may involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve

interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a general and administrative expense 
the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and did not have any interest or penalties accrued as of december  and the company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies

there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas

it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by the company in fiscal in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas fsp that defers the effective date of applying the provisions of sfas to the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of 
table of contents sfas and fsp will have on its results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

additionally  sfas no 
r supersedes fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date 
sfas no 
r now requires that purchased research and development be recognized as an intangible asset 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r prospectively for any acquisition on or after january  and is currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents which consist of cash  money market funds and certificates of deposit with financial institutions 
due to the conservative nature and relatively short duration of our cash and cash equivalents  interest rate risk is mitigated 
our short term investments consist of high grade aaa rated taxable auction rate preferred  and day dutch auction securities and government obligations 
the dutch auction process rests the applicable interest rates at prescribed calendar intervals and is intended to provide liquidity to the holders of auction rate securities by matching buyers and sellers in a market context  enabling the holders to gain immediate liquidity by selling such securities at par  or rolling over their investment 
if there is an imbalance between buyers and sellers  there is a risk of a failed auction 
due to recent credit issues experienced by short term funding markets  some of these securities have failed at auction subsequent to december  an auction failure is not a default  and in some cases it could reset the applicable interest rates to a higher rate as outlined by the security 
we do not currently intend to liquidate these investments at below par value or prior to a reset date 
however  if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  we could determine that some of our investments are impaired 
we will assess the fair value of these securities at the end of each quarter to determine if an impairment charge may be required 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that any lack of liquidity related to these securities will materially affect our ability to operate our business
