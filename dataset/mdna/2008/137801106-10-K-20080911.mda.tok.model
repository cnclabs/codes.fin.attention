overview introduction we are a growing independent oil and natural gas company that is primarily utilizing waterflooding and enhanced oil recovery techniques to increase production and reserves at our existing properties and properties we may acquire in the future 
our assets are located onshore us in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
our focus on domestic  mature oil fields eliminates exploration risk and the uncertainty of international development 
during our first three years of operations  our primary focus was to achieve growth through acquiring existing  mature oil and natural gas fields 
we believe the portfolio of oil and natural gas properties that we have acquired provides ample opportunities to apply our operational strategy 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition targets that are consistent with our operational strategy 
during the fiscal year ended june   our primary emphasis was to achieve growth by developing our existing oil and natural gas properties through development activities such as waterflooding and eor technology 
these development activities are more clearly described under capital development update 
as of june   we had proved reserves of mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp  mmboe were pdnp  and mmboe were pud 
pdp reserves increased by million to mmboe from mmboe at june  after considering production of mmboe for the twelve months ended june  the increase in pdp reserves was primarily driven by conversion of mmboe from pud to pdp based upon initial response at the cockrell ranch waterflood 
the remaining mmboe increase resulted from our infill drilling program at the cato properties 
crude oil reserves accounted for of our total reserves at june  notwithstanding our pdp growth  overall estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves decreased approximately to mmboe as of june   as compared to mmboe as of june  the decrease in total proved reserves was primarily driven by revisions to our five year development plan based on current industry practice that placed many reserves outside the window of 
table of contents allowed proved reserves classification and reduced the allowed pud locations booked per pdp location 
we also adjusted our five year development plan due to lower than expected performance at our barnett shale project 
capital development update for the year ended june  fiscal year  we incurred million of capital expenditures million spent to implement developmental projects at our existing fields to increase reserves  convert existing pud reserves to pdp reserves  and increase production 
for the year ending june  fiscal year  we have a capital development budget of million  which is projected to be spent as follows million at the cato properties million at the panhandle properties million at the nowata properties million at the desdemona properties waterflood million at the desdemona properties barnett shale million at other projects our capital development program includes the drilling of new wells 
the financing of our capital expenditures is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
the status of our capital development activity during the fiscal year and planned activity during the fiscal year is summarized as follows panhandle properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the panhandle properties are mmboe  of which mmboe are pdp and mmboe are pud 
as previously discussed  during the fiscal year  mmboe of pud waterflood reserves were converted to pdp reserves based on the positive response seen at the cockrell ranch unit waterflood 
the mmboe represents approximately one third of the june  pud reserves 
the remaining two thirds continue to be classified as pud reserves 
gross oil production during june exceeded  boe  a three fold increase from february full injection of over  bwipd is continuing at the cockrell ranch unit and the cumulative injected pore volume is over  or 
pvi 
extensive well surveillance is being performed to install larger pumping units and optimize production 
additionally  injection wells have been worked over to optimize and redirect water injection into the highest remaining oil saturation intervals of the brown dolomite formation 
total fluid production has increased to over  barrels per day and we are starting to see the first signs of increases in injection well pressure 
this is the initial sign of placing injected water into unswept areas of the formation  which have higher remaining oil saturations  which should result in varying degrees of increasing oil production in the next three to six months 
the next project phase of our waterflood project at the panhandle properties consists of six separate mini phases on reduced well spacing that will allow us to accelerate the development of this property 
the tighter spacing and smaller development patterns should allow quicker permitting and response times  and allow a larger development bandwidth over a greater acreage position in the field 
we anticipate drilling new wells to facilitate waterflood development 
including the increases in the cockrell ranch unit  as previously discussed  field production decreased by boepd during april and may as unscheduled gas plant maintenance and the initiation of a field wide chemical treatment program took a large number of non waterflood wells offline 
current net production is approximately boepd 

table of contents cato properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the cato properties are mmboe  of which mmboe are pdp  mmboe are pdnp and mmboe are pud 
these properties include roughly  acres across three fields in chavez and roosevelt counties  new mexico 
the prime asset is the roughly  acre cato field  which produces from the historically prolific san andres formation  which has been successfully waterflooded in the permian basin for over years 
there were two successful waterflood pilots conducted in the field in the s by shell and amoco 
we believe the pdp reserve increase of mmboe resulting from our infill drilling program during the fiscal year provides support for our plans for continued capital development at the cato properties 
the drilling results for the fiscal year included wells drilled  of which were to develop the cato waterflood on acre spacing 
two wells were drilled on acre spacing to test other undrilled acres of the field 
additionally  over wells were returned to production rtp 
the results of our rtp program and drilling increased production from boepd during april to over boepd in april the development plan for the fiscal year is to drill new waterflood pattern wells and initiate water injection 
we presented our waterflood application to the new mexico oil and gas conservation commission in may and stand ready to commence ten water injection wells once the permit application is approved 
we will be in a position to initiate water injection in ten additional wells at the cato field within days of permit receipt 
current net production is approximately boepd 
during may  we released the drilling rig to concentrate on waterflood facility infrastructure and no new wells have been brought on line since then 
in july  we reinstated our drilling program 
pipe was set on the first new well on july  production is expected to increase from the restarted acre infill drilling program in the near term 
desdemona properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the desdemona properties are mmboe  of which mmboe are pdp  mmboe are pdnp and boe are pud 
current net production is approximately boepd 
desdemona properties waterflood 
we drilled and completed required replacement wells to initiate the development of the duke sand waterflood on the desdemona properties during the fiscal year 
procurement and infrastructure development of the waterflood facilities was completed in september water injection commenced in september to date  we have injected over million barrels of water into a pilot location of the duke sand reservoir 
since this is a peripheral flood pattern  the time between pumping water into the reservoir and a response will be longer than at conventional patterns 
we continue to monitor the results and while we have seen positive oil production and fluid production levels in the pattern wells  we do not expect to see meaningful response from this waterflood until the second calendar quarter of contingent on the success of the pilot  we have planned capital expenditures of million for the continued development of this waterflood 
desdemona properties barnett shale 
we have successfully drilled and completed wells in the barnett shale formation in eastland  erath and commanche counties  located approximately miles west of established barnett shale production in the fort worth basin  texas 
we drilled fifteen vertical wells during the fiscal year ended june  the fiscal year to delineate the lateral extent of the barnett shale formation within the roughly  acres of our desdemona properties 
the results of the vertical well test program provided encouraging results that allowed us to initiate our horizontal well development program in the field 
we drilled four horizontal wells at the end of the fiscal year and continued with four more early in the fiscal year 
our fiscal year year end reserves were based on our vertical test results and analogs 
we internally estimated total horizontal locations on roughly acre spacing  of which future horizontal locations were considered for pud reserves 
we booked proved reserves of mmboe for the barnett shale at june  of this amount  mmboe were pud reserves 
we also have the marble falls formation re completion potential 
table of contents in all of our vertical and horizontal barnett shale wells 
based on the three existing marble falls re completions producing in the field for the fiscal year  we booked mmboe of proved reserves  of which mmboe were pud reserves in the marble falls formation 
in response to low natural gas prices during the first quarter of our fiscal year  we elected to defer the drilling program in the barnett shale 
since there was no drilling for the remainder of the fiscal year  normal field decline was experienced 
for determining year end reserves for the fiscal year  we considered the lower performance from the existing wells and  based on current industry practice  limited the number of pud locations that could be booked against existing wells 
therefore  pud reserves were reduced by approximately mmboe due to lower performance results from the existing wells and further reduced by another mmboe as the number of pud drilling locations decreased from to these horizontal wells had high initial rates of over mmcfpd but experienced a large amount of water production 
we subsequently received permission from the texas railroad commission to inject the barnett shale water production into our desdemona duke sand waterflood project 
barnett shale production for fiscal year averaged approximately mcfpd 
we have budgeted million in our fiscal year capital development budget to drill two barnett shale wells to test other areas of the field and to ensure additional water supply for the duke sand waterflood project nowata properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the nowata properties are mmboe  all of which are pdp 
current net production is approximately boepd 
our asp tertiary recovery pilot project has been in full operation since december to date  we have injected close to 
pvi of asp 
we expect an initial response to the asp pilot by the end of the calendar year 
we also plan to drill ten new wells during the fiscal year if we receive positive results from the asp pilot 
davenport properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the davenport properties are mmboe  of which mmboe are pdp and mmboe are pdnp 
current net production is approximately boepd 
during the fiscal year  we returned five injector wells and four producing wells as we progressed toward optimizing the waterflood pattern 
we are currently evaluating the sale of these properties 
pantwist properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the pantwist properties are mmboe  of which mmboe are pdp and mmboe are pud 
current net production is approximately boepd 
on september   we entered into an agreement to sell our membership interest in pantwist  llc for million cash  subject to closing adjustments 
the sale has an effective date of july  and we expect to finalize the sale on or before october  the primary asset of the pantwist  llc is the pantwist properties 
corsicana properties 
the corsicana properties were the subject of a proved surfactant polymer chemical injection pilot in the s 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the corsicana properties is mboe  of which mboe are pdp and mboe are pud 
we drilled and completed pattern replacement wells in order to reinstate a prior waterflood in this field during the fiscal year 
we received the required permits to inject water in june the waterflood was successfully re instated in december we achieved full injection of  bwipd and are monitoring initial flood results 
we experienced production rates of to boepd during the quarter ended june  we have been pleased with the remaining oil saturations in this field and coupled with the prior successful polymer pilot in this field in the s  we believe this field is a prime asp candidate 
once the waterflood response and laboratory results are analyzed  we anticipate evaluating an asp pilot in the field during the second half of calendar year current net production is approximately boepd 
after paying down outstanding debt and the possible payment of a portion of the series d preferred stock  based on the positive development results seen from our fiscal year capital 
table of contents programs at the panhandle and cato properties  we expect to commit any remaining net proceeds from the sale of the pantwist properties  as previously discussed  to continued development of these two properties and or to strategic acquisitions 
industry conditions we believe significant acquisition opportunities exist and will continue to exist as major energy companies and larger independents continue to focus their attention and resources toward the discovery and development of large fields 
management expects the trend of the past several years to continue where larger companies have been divesting mature oilfields 
this trend should provide ample opportunities for smaller independent companies to acquire and exploit mature us fields 
we expect  however  that there will be increased competition for such properties in the future 
our strategy exploit and develop existing properties 
we believe we have acquired an attractive portfolio of assets to implement our business plan 
we intend to add proved reserves to  and increase production from  our existing properties through the application of advanced eor technologies  including water  gas and chemical flooding and other techniques 
acquire strategic assets 
we seek to acquire low cost assets with reserves suitable for eor techniques in the onshore us we will continue to target acquisitions that meet our engineering and operational standards in a financially prudent manner 
no exploration risk 
our portfolio is comprised of mature fields with proven reserves  existing infrastructure and abundant technical information 
accordingly  our production growth is not dependent on exploration drilling and the high degree of speculation associated with making new discoveries 
eor techniques involve significant capital investment and an extended period of time  generally a year or longer  until production increases 
generally  surfactant polymer injection is regarded as more risky compared to waterflood operations 
our ability to successfully convert pud reserves to pdp reserves will be contingent upon our ability to obtain future financing and or raise additional capital 
further  there are inherent uncertainties associated with the production of oil and natural gas as well as price volatility 
see risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been issuance of equity securities  borrowings under our credit agreements  and cash flows from operating activities 
these sources are discussed in greater detail below

cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources at june   our cash balance was million 
we had cash provided by operating activities of million during the fiscal year  which was an improvement of million as compared to the million provided by operations for the fiscal year 
the million improvement is largely attributable to improved earnings from operations as discussed under results of operations years ended june    and and to the release of restrictions related to million of restricted cash 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  an amendment to the senior credit agreement permits use of the million of restricted cash for general corporate purposes  in addition to attorneys fees  settlement amounts and other litigation expenses incurred to defend and or settle the fire litigation discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of june   we had fully expended the restricted cash and we no longer had a balance for restricted cash 
at june   we had unused borrowing capacity of million  however  after the million paydown of long term debt from the equity issuance completed on july   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we had unused borrowing capacity of million 
the average interest rate of our debt was at june  we believe the combination of cash on hand  cash flow generated from operations  available debt of million under our credit agreements as of june   pro forma for the effect of the july equity capital raise  as previously discussed  and access to the capital markets for future public and or private debt or equity issuances should be sufficient to finance our working capital needs and the million capital expenditure program for the fiscal year  discussed under overview capital development update 
however  no assurance may be given that we will be successful in improving our operating results  the success of our field developmental activities during the next twelve months or that we can successfully access capital markets for debt or equity issuances 
on september   we entered into an agreement to sell our membership interest in pantwist  llc for million cash  subject to closing adjustments 
the sale has an effective date of july   and we expect to finalize the sale on or before october  the primary asset of the pantwist  llc is the pantwist properties

operating revenues in thousands sales oil mbbls gas mmcf mboe average price bbl mcf boe fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million represent an improvement of million as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million improvement is primarily attributable to higher realized prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales  as shown in the above table  which led to increases of million and million  respectively  and including a full twelve months of cato properties operating revenues versus three months in fiscal year 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million represent an improvement of million as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million

the average price we received for our crude oil sales is generally at or above market prices received at the wellhead other than at the cato properties 
the average price we receive for our natural gas sales is approximately the market price received at the wellhead less transportation and marketing expenses 

table of contents we expect to grow sales through our development plans as previously discussed under overview capital development update 
operating expenses fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the million increase is primarily attributed to increased lease operating expenses of million  higher general and administrative expenses of million  higher production and ad valorem taxes of million  and increased depletion and depreciation expense of million

fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year operating expenses of million 
the million increase is primarily attributed to including a full twelve months of panhandle and pantwist properties operating expenses in the fiscal year  accounted for million of the increase 
the fiscal year included seven months of panhandle properties operating activities and two months of pantwist properties operating activities  higher general and administrative expenses of million  and higher operating expenses due to increased sales volumes  as discussed under operating revenues 
lease operating expenses our lease operating expenses loe consist of the costs of producing crude oil and natural gas such as labor  supplies  repairs  maintenance  workovers and utilities 
for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million higher as compared to the fiscal year loe of million 
we have incurred higher loe due to the inclusion of the cato properties  increased lifting costs at the desdemona properties  increased workover rig expenses at the panhandle and pantwist properties  increased electricity expense  increased crude oil and natural gas sales as discussed previously and generally higher costs for goods and services 
the fiscal year has a full year of cato properties operating results versus three months in the fiscal year 
our loe per boe has increased from during the fiscal year to for the fiscal year  for the reasons previously discussed 
for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million higher as compared to the fiscal year loe of million 
the million increase is attributable to the inclusion of a full twelve months of panhandle and pantwist properties operating results  and to support increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes  as previously discussed under operating revenues 
for the fiscal year  the loe per boe was  which was lower than the loe per boe of incurred during the fiscal year 
we generally incur a high amount of loe because our fields are more mature and typically produce less oil and more water  and they are generally at the end of the primary or secondary production cycle 
however  we expect the loe per boe to decrease during the fiscal year as 
table of contents production increases from the waterflood and eor development activities we are implementing as discussed under the overview capital development update 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of support services for our operating activities and investor relations costs 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were increased stock compensation expense of million resulting from the issuance of stock options as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and the issuance of restricted shares as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  increased labor and staffing costs of million  which includes the accrual of bonuses earned during the fiscal year and the payment of bonuses during the quarter ended december   and higher legal fees of million pertaining to the fire litigation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by lower fees of million for accounting services to achieve full compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and reductions totaling million pertaining to other expenses 
for the fiscal year and fiscal year  our payroll and payroll related costs were million and million  respectively  of our total g a expenses 
we expect these costs to continue to increase because the recent growth in the petroleum industry has increased competition for labor resources and because we seek to increase total employees due to continued growth 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than the fiscal year g a expenses of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were increased labor and staffing costs of million  higher legal fees of million to comply with regulatory requirements and for litigation  increased fees of million for accounting services we incurred in connection with sec reporting and to achieve full compliance with the section of the sarbanes oxley act  added expenses of million to maintain the panhandle properties offices  and other increases totaling million including  higher office rent expenses  increased board of director compensation and increased insurance costs 
depletion and depreciation for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  an increase of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense of million 
this includes depletion expense pertaining to our oil and natural gas properties  and depreciation expense pertaining to our field operations vehicles and equipment  natural gas plant  office furniture and computers 
the increase is due to increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes as previously 
table of contents discussed under operating revenues and higher per boe depletion rates 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe  as compared to fiscal year rate of per boe 
the higher depletion rates resulted from a reduction of reserves for the desdemona barnett shale and pantwist properties  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and higher depletion rates attributed to the cato properties 
for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  an increase of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense of million 
the increase is due to increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes as previously discussed under operating revenues and higher depletion rates 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe as compared to the fiscal year rate of per boe 
the higher depletion rates are attributable to higher rates pertaining to the gas production from the desdemona barnett shale property  reduced proved producing reserves for the panhandle properties and higher rates attributed to the cato properties acquired in march production and ad valorem taxes for the  and fiscal years  production and ad valorem taxes were million  million  and million  respectively 
the annual increases are attributable to higher revenues  as previously discussed 
interest expense for  and fiscal years  we incurred interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  as a direct result of the credit agreements we entered into  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and under liquidity and capital resources credit agreements 
the interest expense for the and fiscal years was impacted by million and million  respectively  of interest cost that was capitalized to the waterflood and asp projects discussed under the overview capital development update 
the total interest cost including capitalized interest of million during the current year is million higher than the comparable amount of million for the prior year due to higher debt balances incurred during the current year 
the total interest cost of million for the fiscal year is comparable to that of the fiscal year 
unrealized loss on commodity derivatives as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as required by our credit agreements  we have entered into commodity derivative contracts for crude oil and natural gas production 
for the fiscal year  we recorded an unrealized loss of million to reflect the fair value of the commodity derivatives as of june  the million unrealized loss is million higher than the fiscal year unrealized loss of million 
the fiscal year unrealized loss was million 
the unrealized loss is a non cash charge resulting from the mark to market valuation of our commodity derivatives that pertains to future periods 
of the million amount for the fiscal year  million pertained to the costless collars  which did not require any initial cash outlay and do not involve future cash outlay unless the nymex crude oil and natural gas prices exceed the ceiling prices as specified in the table in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents regarding the million unrealized loss on commodity derivatives for the fiscal year  million occurred during the quarter ended june  this resulted from significant price increases for both oil and natural gas during the quarter ended june  which increased our derivative liabilities due under our commodity derivatives at june  by their nature  the value of these commodity derivatives can be highly volatile which can cause fluctuations in our earnings 
a ten percent change in these prices for our derivative instruments can impact earnings by approximately million 
realized gain loss on commodity derivatives during the fiscal year  there were net settlements under our derivative agreements due to our counterparty of million  as compared to the and fiscal years for which we received net settlements from our counterparty of million and million  respectively 
for the  and fiscal years  the settlements received by us primarily resulted from cumulative monthly payments we received from a counterparty since the nymex natural gas price was lower than the natural gas floor prices  which ranged between and per mcf 
for the fiscal year  the settlements paid by us were cumulative monthly payments we made to our counterparty since the nymex crude oil price was higher than the crude oil ceiling prices of and per barrel that expired on june   and for ceiling prices specified under our costless collars 
our commodity derivative agreements are discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit for the   and fiscal years  we recorded a deferred income tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year  the million benefit amounts to an effective tax rate of approximately  due to recording the effect of a change in enacted rates in the state of texas in may  amounting to  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
the effective rate for both the and fiscal years was approximately 
income from discontinued operations on june   pursuant to the terms of an agreement for purchase and sale  we sold our interests in certain rich valley properties located in oklahoma and kansas rich valley properties to anadarko minerals  inc for net proceeds of million cash 
the sale of the rich valley properties resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the fiscal year  we recognized income from the discontinued operations of million 
for the fiscal year  we recognized a loss from discontinued operations of  due to the payment of oklahoma sales taxes on the sale of these properties 
the sale is discussed in greater detail at note to the consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividend for the and fiscal years  we incurred million and million respectively  of preferred stock dividends as a result from the preferred stock financing  which was completed on september   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and above under liquidity and capital resources september financing 
the fiscal year amount includes million of federal tax we were required to withhold in accordance with internal revenue service regulations from september through june these amounts did not have a material effect to our prior period financial statements 
we did not have preferred stock dividends during the fiscal year

this resulted from significant price increases for both oil 
table of contents and natural gas during the quarter ended june  which increased our derivative liabilities due under our commodity derivatives at june  critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
these are the accounting policies that we have determined involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires management to make judgments and estimates  including choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
oil and natural gas properties and equipment we follow the successful efforts method of accounting 
all developmental costs are capitalized 
we are predominately engaged in the acquisition and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
the property costs reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets resulted from acquisitions and development activity 
capitalized overhead costs that directly relate to our drilling and development activities were million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we recorded capitalized interest costs of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we record capitalized interest for projects that have an expected cost of at least million and a development period of at least six months 
depreciation and depletion of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
repairs and maintenance are expensed  while renewals and betterments are generally capitalized 
our unit of production amortization rates are revised on a quarterly basis 
our development costs and lease and wellhead equipment are depleted based on proved developed reserves 
our leasehold costs are depleted based on total proved reserves 
investments in major development projects are not depleted until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
as of june  and  capitalized costs related to waterflood and asp projects that are in process and not subject to depletion amounted to million and million  respectively 
at least quarterly  or more frequently if conditions indicate that long term assets may be impaired  the carrying value of our properties is compared to management s future estimated pre tax cash flow from the properties 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the asset value is written down to fair value 
impairment of individually significant unproved properties is assessed on a property by property basis  and impairment of other unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis 
we had no significant unproved properties at june  or no impairment was necessary for the years ended june   or estimates of proved reserves the term proved reserves is defined by the securities and exchange commission in rule a of regulation s x adopted under the securities act of  as amended 
in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological or engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based on future conditions 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  increasing net loss 
a decline in 
table of contents estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also may make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
in addition  a decline in proved reserves may impact our assessment of our oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas actually produced 
asset retirement obligation our financial statements reflect the fair value for any asset retirement obligation that can be reasonably estimated 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties on the consolidated balance sheets 
periodic accretion of the discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when crude oil and natural gas quantities are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser 
title to the produced quantities transfers to the purchaser at the time the purchaser receives or collects the quantities 
prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices 
the purchasers of such production have historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within thirty five days of the end of each production month 
we periodically review the difference between the dates of production and the dates we collect payment for such production to ensure that accounts receivable from those purchasers are collectible 
the point of sale for our oil and natural gas production is at our applicable field gathering systems  therefore  we do not incur transportation costs related to our sales of oil and natural gas production 
as previously discussed  we sold our crude oil and natural gas production to several independent purchasers 
during the year ended june   we had sales of or more of our total revenues to four customers which represented   and of total operating revenue  respectively 
during the year ended june   we had sales of or more of our total revenues to four customers which represented   and of total operating revenue  respectively 
during the year ended june   we had sales to primarily five customers which represented    and of total operating revenue  respectively 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based payment arrangements with employees and directors at their grant date fair value and record the related expense over the requisite service period 
commodity derivatives we are required to hedge a portion of our production at specified prices for oil and natural gas under the senior and subordinated credit agreements  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the objective is to reduce our exposure to declining commodity prices 
by locking in minimum prices  we protect the outstanding debt amounts and maximize the funds available under our existing credit agreements  which helps us to support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans 
we have entered into commodity derivatives that involve costless collars and price floors for our crude oil and natural gas production 
these derivatives are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value 

table of contents we do not designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow or fair value hedges 
we do not hold or issue commodity derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to our commodity derivatives 
we anticipate  however  that our counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the commodity derivatives contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support our commodity derivatives contracts subject to credit risk and we monitor the credit standing of the counterparties 
changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded immediately in earnings as unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations 
cash flows resulting from the settlement of our derivative instruments are recorded as realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk pursuant to our credit agreements  we are subject to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations  as described under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit agreements 
during our fiscal year ended june   if there had been an increase in the interest rate of  our total interest cost would have increased by  annually 
commodity risk our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our credit agreements discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to enter into commodity derivative contracts to mitigate price risk on at least and no greater than of our crude oil and natural gas production attributable to pdp reserves for at least three years as of the end of each six month period 
therefore  for the hedged production  we will receive at least the floor prices 
assuming that the prices that we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production are above the floor prices  based on our actual fiscal year sales volumes for the year ended june   a decline in the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
as a direct result of the subordinated credit agreement  we entered into costless collar financial contracts with uboc as follows time period floor oil price ceiling oil price barrels per day floor gas price ceiling gas price mcf per day barrels of equivalent oil per day 
table of contents prior to obtaining the subordinated debt  our financial contracts consisted of purchasing price floors 
as of june   these financial contracts are summarized in the table below 
time period floor oil price barrels per day floor gas price gas mcf per day barrels of equivalent oil per day the total volumes covered by costless collars and price floors detailed in the above tables are greater than of our crude oil and natural gas production volumes attributable to pdp reserves for at least three years 
the lenders under our senior and subordinated credit agreements have approved all commodity derivative contracts 
we computed our mark to market valuations used for our commodity derivatives based on assumptions regarding forward prices  volatility and the time value of money 
we compared our valuations to our counterparties valuations to further validate our mark to market valuations 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized unrealized loss on commodity derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
of the million amount for the year ended june   million pertained to the costless collars  which did not require any initial cash outlay and do not involve future cash outlay unless the nymex crude oil and natural gas prices exceed the ceiling prices as specified in the table above 
if crude oil prices fell below our hedged crude oil price floor  we would have received approximately  annually due to having the crude oil price floor hedge in place 
if natural gas prices fell below our hedged natural gas price floor  we would have received approximately  annually due to having the natural gas price floor hedge in place
