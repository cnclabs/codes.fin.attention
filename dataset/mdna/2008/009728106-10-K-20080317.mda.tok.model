item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for more information 
the percentages of gross sales  revenue and gross trade receivables attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors for the years ended december  and december  were as follows gross net gross accounts gross net gross accounts sales revenue receivable sales revenue receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are distributors of our products as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with cardinal and mckesson 
we have also established a fee for service contract with amerisourcebergen  which began in january a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations

as of december   we had approximately  of products on backorder as compared to approximately  of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all current open backorders during 
table of contents government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any drug can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
fda warning letter 
on march   we received an fda warning letter the warning letter following a routine inspection of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility conducted september  the warning letter cited violations of the cgmp regulations 
the warning letter stated that failure to promptly correct the cited violations may result in legal action without further notice  including  without limitation  seizure and injunction 
it also stated that approval of pending new drug applications may be withheld until the violations are corrected and that a subsequent confirmatory fda inspection may be made 
we responded to the warning letter on april  providing clarifying information and describing corrective actions planned and or completed 
the warning letter did not interrupt or delay the manufacture and distribution of our decatur products already approved by the fda 
per the fda s schedule for inspections  the decatur site hosted a gmp pre approval inspection pai beginning july  through august  this fda inspection was conducted in parallel with the fda approval of an alternate contract manufacturer for ic green 
the fda inspection was to determine if we had corrected the violations cited in the warning letter and to determine if our lyophilization operations could be approved for the manufacture of products subject to pending new drug applications 
the fda investigators identified a number of observations representing potential violations of the cgmp regulations 
we submitted comprehensive responses to these observations on september  and in correspondence received on december  from the chicago district of the fda  the fda reported the satisfactory resolution of past cgmp issues and assigned a voluntary action indicated status to the decatur operation  thereby lifting the warning letter  approving the new lyophilization facility  and facilitating new product approvals 
as a result of this inspection  we have been eligible for pending product approvals in our ophthalmic  ampoule  liquid vial and lyophilization production filling suites in our decatur facility and have received two product approvals during the first quarter of the decatur site continues to optimize its lyophilization process in order to maximize volume throughput 
this optimization effort is due for completion in the second half of product recalls 
there were no product recalls during  or dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were from external customers located in foreign countries 
the decline in volume is primarily due to one customer switching over to internally sourcing an ophthalmic product they had previously purchased from us in seasonality 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality other than flu vaccine products which we anticipate launching later in 
table of contents government contracts 
none of our business segments are generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
we have experienced recent operating losses  working capital deficiencies and negative cash flows from operations  and these losses and deficiencies may continue in the future 
our recent operating losses may continue in the future and there can be no assurance that our financial outlook will improve 
for the years ended december   and  our operating losses were   and  respectively 
we generated a negative cash flow from operations in of  however we generated positive flows of  and negative flows of  in and  respectively 
if our results of operations do not improve we would have to implement a restructuring plan in order to preserve our cash flow and continue business operations 
we have invested significant resources in the development of lyophilization manufacturing capability  and we may not realize the benefit of these efforts and expenditures 
we are in the final stages of completing an expansion of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility to add capacity to provide lyophilization manufacturing services  a manufacturing capability we currently do not have 
as of december   we had spent approximately  on the lyophilization facility expansion and anticipate the need to spend approximately  of additional funds which will primarily be used for testing and validation as the major capital equipment items are currently in place 
in december  we placed the sterile solutions portion of this operation in service which augments our existing production capacities 
the remaining  of construction in progress  which is specific to lyophilization freeze dry operations  is awaiting final validation testing for us to place this equipment into commercial production 
we are working toward the development of an internal abbreviated new drug application anda lyophilized product pipeline 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development of lyophilization capability  or that other intervening events will not occur that reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits from such capability 
for instance  the market for lyophilized products could significantly diminish or be eliminated  or new technological advances could render the lyophilization process obsolete  prior to our entry into the market 
there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits from our significant investment into lyophilization capability at our decatur manufacturing facility  and our failure to do so could significantly limit our ability to grow our business in the future 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales  revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three distributors  amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson  accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations and lead to a violation of debt covenants 
a change in purchasing patterns  inventory levels  increases in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 

table of contents certain of our directors are subject to conflicts of interest 
dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  the chairman of our board of directors  our chief executive officer from march to december  and a principal shareholder  is affiliated with ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional capital to grow our business and such funds may not be available to us 
we may require additional funds to grow our business 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us due to our recent financial history 
further  the terms of such additional financing  if obtained  likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may not meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances which may not result in marketable products 
we have entered several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements  license agreements  and a joint venture that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will result in fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such finished dosage form products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully market and distribute new products  including vaccine products  through various distribution channels 
we continue to seek out and introduce new pharmaceutical healthcare products 
our improved financial performance is dependent on new product introductions  such as the biologies and vaccine products discussed above 
any delays or an inability to successfully market and distribute such products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 

table of contents our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate which branded pharmaceuticals are about to come off patent and thus permit us to develop  manufacture and market equivalent generic pharmaceutical products 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than that of branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products that third parties develop may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if meritless 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of products manufactured by third parties  including our competitors in some instances 
there can be no assurance that our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of such products will not adversely affect our profit margins or our ability to develop and deliver our products on a timely and competitive basis 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute certain of our products as planned 
no assurance can be made that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key executive officers 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
we are particularly dependent upon dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  chairman of our board of directors  and mr 
arthur s 
przybyl  our chief executive officer 
the inability to attract and retain key executive officers  or the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to attract and retain key personnel to be able to compete successfully 
our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
fda regulations 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were previously subject to an fda warning letter which the fda issued to us in october which was subsequently removed in in march  we were again subject to a warning letter at our decatur facility which was removed in december see item business fda warning letter 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a number of products we market are grandfathered drugs that are permitted to be manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed prior to enactment of relevant sections of the fdc act and amendments thereto 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
any such change in the status of a grandfathered product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
there were no product recalls in  or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of our products 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  or iii competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or obsoleting those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have registered  shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements on a form s and form s filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 
exercise of warrants and options may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business  and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock 

table of contents we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
penny stock rules may make buying or selling our common stock difficult 
as of march   the market price of our common stock exceeded per share 
however  there can be no guarantee that it will continue to do so 
if our market price falls below per share  trading in our common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
these rules would require that any broker dealer that would have to recommend our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors  must  prior to the sale  make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction 
unless an exception is available  the regulations would require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market 
in addition  broker dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements are extensive 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight is required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

we added  square feet to our decatur manufacturing facility to add the ability to provide lyophilization manufacturing services 
manufacturing capabilities for lyophilized products are projected to be in place by the second half of we currently do not need lyophilization capabilities  but such capabilities would give us the capability to manufacture additional products for our contract customers and allow us to pursue other anda products and to internally produce one of our outsourced products 
as of december   we had spent approximately  on the lyophilization expansion and anticipate the need to spend approximately  of additional funds  which will be focused primarily on validation testing

we can produce approximately batches per month if our decatur and somerset facilities are all operating at normal capacity 
operating the manufacturing facilities at the reduced level has led to lower gross margins due  in part  to unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs 
our current space in decatur is considered adequate to accommodate our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future while we are expanding our manufacturing space at our somerset production facility to accommodate new product growth 
since august  our headquarters and certain administrative offices  as well as a finished goods warehouse  have been located in leased space at millbrook drive  buffalo grove  illinois

we expect to relocate to this facility in the second quarter of we have also signed a ten year lease for approximately  square feet for our new headquarters location in lake forest  illinois  which we will occupy in the second half of item legal proceedings 
we are party to legal proceedings and potential claims arising in the ordinary course of our business 
the amount  if any  of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined 
despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we at this time do not believe that such proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows

however  there can be no guarantee that it will continue to do so 
if our market price falls below per share  trading in our common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
these rules would require that any broker dealer that would have to recommend our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors  must  prior to the sale  make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction 
unless an exception is available  the regulations would require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market 
in addition  broker dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock
