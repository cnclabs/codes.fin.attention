we are a leading developer  manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating  diagnosing  and managing sleep disordered breathing sdb and other respiratory disorders 
during the fiscal year we continued our efforts in building awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this underpenetrated market 
in our efforts we have raised awareness through a number of market initiatives which highlighted the increasing link between the potential effect sdb can have on cardiovascular diseases and type diabetes 
in conjunction with these direct efforts we also donated million to the resmed foundation in the united states during fiscal year the foundation s overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdb osa  particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements

these new offerings will enable us to capitalize on continuing developments in patient needs whilst also positioning us for future growth 
during the year  our industry has seen some significant market developments 
major cardiac associations have begun advocating screening and treating cardiac patients for sdb whilst the international diabetes foundation idf has issued a consensus statement recommending the screening of type diabetes patients suspected of sleep apnea 
in the us medicare approved reimbursement of home sleep testing to diagnose patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
this ruling will offer patients the option to be assessed through a facility based test in a lab or through a portable diagnostic test performed in the patient s home 
we believe this will increase the diagnostic capacity in the us industry allowing greater access for patients 
several u 
s large private insurers have followed suit  and the industry is now well positioned for the next wave of patients seeking diagnosis and treatment

table of contents stock based compensation costs we have granted stock options to personnel  including officers and directors  under our incentive award plan  as amended the plan 
these options have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over four years 
we granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant 
we have also offered to our personnel  including officers and directors  the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
as of july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas no 
shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  using the graded attribution method for stock based awards granted prior to july  and the straight line method for stock based awards granted after july  the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model  assuming no dividends and the following assumptions years ended june stock options weighted average grant date fair value weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life in years volatility espp purchase rights weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life months months months volatility expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to their expected term 
we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the additional use of the implied volatilities are more representative of our future stock price trends 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal years  and during fiscal years  and  our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend upon  numerous 
table of contents factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a australian tax deduction is available  the level of non deductible expenses  and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  goodwill  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  deferred tax valuation allowances  contingencies and stock based compensation costs 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would 
table of contents influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual  historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment  at which time title transfers to the customer 
revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received 
royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned 
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract 
revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue 
all freight related expenses are charged to cost of sales 
we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products 
these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force 
we do not sell our products to these representatives  and do not recognize revenue on such shipments 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
as such  we have no significant installation obligations 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we measure the compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based 
table of contents upon us treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options 
we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates by employee groups 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary 
voluntary product recall expenses 
we recognized an accrual for the estimated cost of the voluntary product recall at the time the liability was probable and the related expenses could be reasonably estimated 
the amount of this accrual was determined taking into consideration the future probable expenses directly related to the product recall including expected return rates for the affected units  unit replacement costs  legal  consulting  logistical and administrative expenses 
should actual product recall costs differ from our estimated costs or should we receive additional feedback from our ongoing discussions with regulatory bodies  revisions to our estimated product recall accrual may be required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and business risks foreign currency market risk our reporting currency is the us dollar  although the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditures 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro s and the australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
we have determined our hedge

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt 
at june   we had total long term debt  including the current portion of those obligations  of million 
all of this debt is subject to variable interest rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates during the year ended june   would not have a material impact on pretax income 
we have no interest rate hedging agreements 
credit market risk at june   we held a number of investment securities in aaa rated auction securities with various maturities between july and november these investments had regular roll over or auction dates at which time the interest rates were re set or the investments were redeemed for cash 
during the year ended june   we experienced failed auctions with respect to these investments due to the current liquidity issues surrounding the domestic and global capital markets 
we continue to earn interest on these investments in accordance with the contract until the next auction occurs 
in the event we need to access funds invested in these auction rate securities  we may not be able to liquidate these securities at the fair value recorded on june  until a future auction of these securities is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  however  we believe the current lack of liquidity of these investments is temporary due to the current market conditions and our intention to hold these investments until there is an overall improvement in global credit markets 
accordingly we have reclassified these securities from current to non current assets and recognised a charge of million to comprehensive income within shareholder s equity to reflect the fair market value of these securities at june  additionally  based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate the business in the ordinary course
