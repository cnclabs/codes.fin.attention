software licensing revenue includes revenue derived from the licensing of our proprietary platforms and the licensing of third party software applications 
during the twelve months ended december  our total revenue increased million or  to million in compared to million in million of this revenue increase is attributable to the full year inclusion of revenues generated by infinity and finetre acquired in may and october of respectively  and million is attributable the two months of revenue generated by jenquest acquired in november the specific components of our revenue and the changes experienced during the past year are discussed further below

we expect that the support and maintenance services associated with the company s legacy products will continue to decrease due to our pronounced philosophy of finishing legacy support as an offering in the future 
the company will maintain the support of these legacy products as contractually required or for as long as we deem it is economically feasible to do so  after which we will discontinue further associated support services 
software licensing revenue increased million or  from million in to million in this increase is primarily associated with two significant long term contracts executed by our infinity division and involves the sale of source code  software licenses  and customization and implementation services

income taxes income tax expense decreased thousand  or  from thousand in to thousand in this reduction is primarily due to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets net of the respective valuation allowances as related to temporary timing differences associated with specific expense and revenue items that are treated differently for purposes of determining book and taxable income

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated in the united states  requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec sab revenue recognition and therefore we consider revenue earned and realizable when a persuasive evidence of the sales arrangement exists  provided that the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  b delivery or performance has occurred  c customer acceptance has been received  if contractually required  and  d collectibility of the arrangement fee is probable 
the company uses signed contractual agreements as persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the license of software where the software deliverables are considered more than inconsequential to the other elements in the arrangement 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables  we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  individual contractual deliverables are accounted for separately if a the delivered items has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b there is vendor specific objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items  and  c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
software development arrangements involving significant customization  modification or production are accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance on construction type and certain production type contracts  sop using the percentage of completion method 
the company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee 
the company begins to recognize revenue from license fees for its application software products upon delivery and the customer s acceptance of the software implementation and customizations if applicable 
revenue from third party software is derived from the licensing of third party software products in connection with sales of the company s software licenses and is recognized upon delivery together with the company s licensed software products

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  write offs  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of goodwill the company applies the provisions of financial accounting statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which addresses how goodwill and other acquired intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements 
in this regard we test these intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment are present 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
the testing involves comparing the reporting unit and asset carrying values to their respective fair values  we determine fair value by using the present value of future estimated net cash flows 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future discounted cash flows to determine each reporting unit s fair value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during the twelve months ended december   and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances 
for additional information about goodwill  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
the company has not provided deferred us taxes on its unremitted foreign earnings because it considers them to be permanently re invested 
effective january the company adopted the financial accounting interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement 
as used in fin  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 
the company adopted fin during and as a result recognized a thousand liability for unrecognized tax benefits of which thousand was accounted for as a reduction to the january   balance of retained earnings 
foreign currency translation our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates 
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related our foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  however  the company has operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  and india  and we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each location 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  revenues or financial condition 
during the years of   and the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain loss of million  thousand  and thousand respectively 
the company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rate and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of could be experienced in the near term 
such an adverse changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances 
as of december  the company had million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a million balance on our revolving line of credit  the million convertible promissory note with whitebox vsc  ltd  and a million balance on the note payable in connection with the acquisition of ebixlife 
the whitebox convertible note s interest rate is fixed at and the ebixlife note is non interest bearing  therefore these instruments present no risk as to exposures to financial market fluctuations 
the company s revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor  and stood at at december  while the company had interest rate risk related to this revolving line of credit  the exposure during year ending december  was minimal in that the debt was not incurred until december  and was mitigated by the interest income earned on the company s existing cash balances 
the company s average cash balances during were million and its existing cash balances as of december  was million 
the company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax income resulting from a hypothetical decrease in effective interest rates earned on the company s cash balances 
such an adverse change would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately thousand for the year ending december  for the years ending december  and the company determined that such adverse fluctuations in interest rates would not have had a material impact on its results from operations 
the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments
