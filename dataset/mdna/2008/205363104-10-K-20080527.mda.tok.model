overview the company s primary service offerings are outsourcing and i t and professional services 
outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customer s technology infrastructure and applications  and business process outsourcing 
i t and professional services include systems integration  consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services 
csc provides these services to customers in the global commercial and north american public sector markets 
on a geographic basis  csc provides services to global commercial customers in the united states  europe and other international locations 
operations in australia  asia and canada generate substantially all revenue within other international 
economic and industry factors global commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on i t projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
the north american public sector market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
the company recognized the us government s increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on price  services offered  technical ability  experience and flexibility  the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  currency fluctuations related to international operations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore 
cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors  in addition to other factors including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors 
csc employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow over time the primary drivers of the company s cash flow are earnings provided by the company s operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows  as well as non gaap free cash flow 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue and investment base turnover measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital is required to generate sufficient returns on capital 
strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns 
readers should be cautioned that days sales outstanding dso  free cash flow and roi are not gaap measures  and the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies 
csc thinks these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the company s performance and ability to service its debt 
csc calculates dso as follows average of the current and prior period quarterly dsos 
quarterly dsos are calculated as the total receivables at quarter end divided by the revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues for the last twelve months divided by the numbers of days in the last twelve months 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions and dispositions  purchase or sale of available for sale securities and capital lease payments 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover 
the profit margin used is profit before interest expense and special items and after tax divided by revenues 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity 
the company s management uses roi  dso and free cash flow to evaluate segment investment returns and cash flow performance and are some of the measures used to assess management performance 
fiscal highlights significant events during fiscal include revenues rose  and increased on a constant currency basis 
the company recorded a special pretax restructuring charge of million million after tax or cents per share  and a million million after tax or cents per share special pretax charge related to the retirement of its chairman and chief executive officer july  net income  including special charges  was million compared to million for the prior year an increase of 
earnings per share  after special charges  were up 
the fiscal special charge of cents per share  as compared to the prior year special charge of per share  favorably impacted the comparison of earnings per share by  as compared to the prior year

global commercial the values of global commercial segment significant new contracts were not disclosed at clients request 
the north american public sector awards represent the estimated value of the company s portion at contract signing 
they cannot be considered firm orders  however  due to their variable attributes  including demand driven usage  modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the company s north american public sector activities 
revenue growth  after adjusting for the impact of currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions  was in the global commercial sector and after adjusting for acquisitions was in the north american public sector 
new global commercial awards were below historical averages during fiscal and continue to reflect the industry trend  noted last year  toward smaller scope and or shorter term outsourcing contracts 
the majority of the new awards for the global commercial sector was awarded during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
the north american public sector continued to win a share of us federal government contracts as its total contract awards for fiscal increased by from the previous fiscal year with contract awards from the department of defense continuing to lead the way 
currency shifts during fiscal favorably impacted revenue in both europe and other international 
the company has developed a broad  long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines 
approximately of csc s revenues are derived from long term contracts including global commercial outsourcing and us federal government engagements 
this provides the company with a relatively stable base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens 
the company s working capital increased as a result of an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets as well as a decrease in taxes payable 
the net effect was a decrease in cash flow from operations for fiscal the increase in prepaid expenses and other items includes a bond paid to the us internal revenue service irs against certain tax liabilities to stop the accrual of additional interest and an increase in work in process primarily related to the nhs contract 
cash outflow for investing activities increased primarily due to the acquisition of covansys corporation and first consulting group for approximately billion  net of cash acquired 
cash provided from financing activities reflect the company s issuance of billion of long term notes issued to finance the acquisitions noted above 
cash used to acquire outstanding common stock during fiscal of billion was approximately the same as cash expended to acquire outstanding common stock during fiscal fiscal commentary as a leading federal contractor and one of the top i t service providers to the us federal government  csc s north american public sector is well positioned to benefit from continued demand for i t services in this market 
the us federal government is one of the world s largest i t services consumers  and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense  homeland security and civil agency modernization 
while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments can vary  the company expects its broad i t and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
global commercial market awards during fiscal declined compared to prior period amounts 
however  the company expects revenue in the global commercial market to increase from fiscal levels during fiscal much of this increase is expected from leveraging current engagements and expanding the range of services the company provides to current customers 
the company also expects the growth initiatives begun under project accelerate during fiscal  as discussed below  to begin yielding positive results during fiscal the company has a base of significant outsourcing contracts which the company expects to continue to provide a stable revenue stream during fiscal however  growth from this revenue stream is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices 
the company expects the acquisition of covansys corporation to cushion the effect of these pressures on revenue 
during fiscal the company s consulting and systems integration business in europe reversed the historical trend with growth in revenue in the fourth quarter and the company expects this trend to continue on a modest scale during fiscal during fiscal  the company s global commercial segment s revenue was favorably impacted by currency fluctuations in europe and other international regions 
the company cannot forecast future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results 
other trends the company expects for fiscal are as follows revenue for the north american public sector for fiscal will benefit from its billion of announced awards during fiscal this represents a billion increase in awards over fiscal the north american public sector is expected to continue to grow at or above the revenue growth rate for fiscal the company expects global commercial revenue growth to be tempered by the previous softness in new contract awards during the later part of fiscal and fiscal the demand for offshore services is expected to continue to increase as customers seek to lower costs and will present opportunity as well as temper revenue growth in europe as well as the us commercial market 
global commercial revenue growth will benefit from the acquisitions of covansys corporation and first consulting group during fiscal the company has identified and expects to pursue billion of federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal  plus an additional billion during fiscal cash flow from operations for fiscal is expected to increase from the  million for fiscal cash outflow from investing activities  excluding acquisitions  is expected to increase from fiscal levels primarily as a result of investment in computers and related equipment in the us commercial  europe and north american public sector 
interest expense is expected to increase for fiscal as a result of interest on debt issued to acquire covansys corporation and first consulting group 
if the company does not close any significant acquisitions  the company s debt to total capitalization ratio is expected to decline during fiscal as the company does not intend to refinance the term notes due march and term notes due april on a long term basis 
the restructuring plan was completed during fiscal and as such the company will not have restructuring expense for fiscal the company has also relocated its corporate headquarters from el segundo  ca 
to falls church  va 
costs for this move and transition may be offset by a gain from the sale of the headquarters building in el segundo  ca 
the company initiated a foreign currency exposure hedging program during fiscal the program utilized foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the balance sheet exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
beginning in april the company will substantially hedge the economic risk related to costs incurred in the indian rupee  utilizing foreign currency option contracts 
these contracts will not be treated as hedges for accounting purposes 
as such  marking the options to market on a quarterly basis may create volatility in other income

point net unfavorable impact on the expense ratio for fiscal the pretax incremental stock option expense recorded in sg a as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r was approximately million million net of taxes and the pre tax legal and related expenses related to the stock option investigation  including employee taxes to be paid by the company  were approximately million million net of tax 
the comparison of the fiscal ratio to the prior year ratio benefited from a one time adverse impact to the prior year ratio for a provision for doubtful accounts  as noted below  which had a 
point impact on the expense ratio for fiscal the allocation of the sfas no 
r and legal expenses  noted above  for fiscal resulted in an increase in the north american public sector expense ratio of 
points and an increase in the global commercial ratio of 
points 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of billion for fiscal represents of revenue and was  before rounding effects  essentially unchanged from the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense was stable  as a percentage of revenue for both the global commercial and north american public sector segments 
the north american public sector depreciation and amortization expense ratio was unchanged from the level as depreciation and amortization expense increased at approximately the same rate as revenue which increased by 
the global commercial ratio after rounding effects was flat to the prior year 
the flat ratio in global commercial was the result of significant upfront capital investment for outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and in europe and asia and capital refreshes necessary on existing contracts  offset by lower levels of capital investment for us commercial operations and a favorable mix variance in australian operation s with a shift in asset profiles to longer lived assets 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 
points to during fiscal the expense ratio improved in both the north american public sector and in global commercial 
the decrease in the expense ratio was the result of revenue growth and a decline in depreciation and amortization expense to billion for fiscal this decline was the result of an approximately million decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal due primarily to the termination and disposal of the related assets for the sears contract and a shift in the mix of the assets in australia toward longer lived assets 
the north american public sector ratio decreased by 
points as depreciation and amortization expense was held flat and revenue increased by 
the global commercial ratio decreased 
point due to the reduction in expense noted above while revenues were essentially flat to the prior year 
interest expense and interest income the decrease in interest expense for fiscal of million compared to fiscal was primarily due to the election to classify interest on tax related income tax liabilities of million on the income tax expense line upon the adoption of fin during fiscal the prior year periods have not been adjusted to reflect this change in classification and include tax related interest of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
partially offsetting this classification change was interest on billion of commercial paper  subsequently converted to senior notes  issued to finance the acquisition of covansys corporation and fcg corporation 
the issuance of the commercial paper and the senior notes resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million for fiscal interest income decreased by approximately million for fiscal as a result of a decline in cash balances and income from securities sold in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal of million was the result  primarily  of three factors the use of commercial paper to finance the accelerated share repurchase transactions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements which increased interest from commercial paper by million for fiscal  an increase in equipment under capital leases  particularly in the north american public sector  resulted in an increase in interest expense of million  and an increase in interest accrued related to income taxes and income tax contingency items of million 
interest income increased approximately million for fiscal as a result of an increase in interest income from tax refund items  interest income from a partnership and interest on cash balances in asia and canada 
these increases offset the loss of dividend income from the dyncorp international preferred stock which was redeemed during the first quarter of fiscal the result of the increase in interest expense and interest income was an increase in net interest expense of million and an increase in the interest expense ratio of 
points

honeycutt  entered into a retirement agreement pursuant to which mr 
honeycutt resigned as chief executive officer effective may   and as chairman july   and received  as a separation benefit  a lump sum cash payment of million on january  mr 
honeycutt will receive certain other benefits through december  as a result of mr 
honeycutt s retirement  recognition of the expense associated with his unvested stock based compensation was accelerated resulting in stock based compensation of million  of which million was recorded in special items and million was recorded as additional paid in capital 
the total pre tax charge recorded in special items  including the lump sum cash payment and other benefits and the charge for accelerated vesting of employee stock based compensation  was million million net of tax or cents per share 
restructuring in april  the company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal and the objectives of the plan are to streamline csc s worldwide operations and leverage the increased use of lower cost global resources 
restructuring charges consist predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company evaluated facility consolidation opportunities and other areas where operations could be streamlined and costs reduced consistent with the plan objectives  resulting in additional lease termination  asset impairment and other charges 
workforce reductions  including some voluntary terminations  in fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
termination related charges of million were in fiscal compared to termination related charges of million in fiscal other costs  which were primarily related to vacant space  of million were also recorded during fiscal compared to million in all of the restructuring charge in fiscal was incurred in the global commercial reporting segment 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in fiscal year the restructuring plan generated savings of approximately million in fiscal against a plan of million and compares to savings of approximately million in fiscal approximately of the savings come from reduced cost of services  while the remainder will be predominantly from lower selling  general and administrative costs 
savings are net of new or increased recurring costs  primarily the costs anticipated for an increasing offshore workforce 
savings will also be impacted by certain transitional costs as new offshore staff are trained while outgoing staff are still on the payroll 
such transitional costs were 
and million for fiscal and  respectively 
a majority of the planned headcount reductions took place in europe 
for fiscal  european headcount decreased by approximately compared to  in fiscal approximately reductions were made in north america in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
the balance of the reductions occurred in australia and asia 
restructuring related pre tax cash payments of approximately million were made in fiscal  compared to restructuring related pre tax cash payments of approximately million in included in the restructuring charges are pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations  which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions

the gain on sale of non operating assets during fiscal included the sale of a building in austin  tx in march for a gain of approximately million pre tax and the sale of available for sale securities for a gain of approximately million pre tax 
foreign currency net gains and losses for fiscal  and were the result of the effect of currency rate movements  primarily  between the us dollar and the euro  british pound sterling  and australian dollar and between the euro and the danish kroner and british pound sterling 
taxes the provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate as reported for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a prior year impact of income tax credits and the current year classification of tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense as a result of the adoption of fin on march  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rates during fiscal  the remeasurement of tax  penalties  and interest for tax matters relating to fiscal years to  and changes in accounting methods 
the remeasurement of tax  penalties  and interest for tax matters relating to fiscal years to resulted in a decrease of net of tax during fiscal the fiscal tax related interest and penalties increased by net of tax 
these amounts are net of reductions of interest and penalties of net of tax resulting from the filing of applications for changes in accounting method effective in fiscal year the fiscal provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was as compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate during fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of lower state tax and additional income tax credits in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the foreign effective tax rates 
on january   the company paid a million bond to the irs related to certain tax matters 
as a result  tax related interest for these tax matters stopped accruing as of the date of the bond payment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations net of taxes was million for fiscal year income from discontinued operations during fiscal included the gain on sale of health plan solutions of million and the gain from the working capital adjustment for the sale of dyncorp international of million 
the company received million par value preferred stock for the working capital adjustment and recorded taxes of million and a valuation allowance of approximately million against the preferred stock 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
during fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million after tax or per share as a result of implementing the interpretation to account for the company s unrecorded legal obligations to restore some of its leased facilities to their original condition upon lease expiration 
earnings per share and share base earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased to 
earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal benefited from an increase in net income as a result of an increase in revenue and an increase in the income before taxes margin of points compared to the prior year 
the increase in the margin was primarily due to a decrease in special charges of million from the prior year with an additional point increase when special charges are excluded from the calculation 
earnings per share also benefited from a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding during fiscal this reduction was due to two factors during fiscal the company repurchased million outstanding shares of common stock through a b repurchase plan for approximately billion and received an additional million shares as final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase transactions executed during fiscal and the decrease in the share price during the last half of fiscal reduced common stock equivalents by  these reductions in the weighted average were partially offset by the exercise of million employee stock options during the year 
the net result was a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million shares which resulted in a share increase in earnings per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase transactions 
earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased to 
earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were adversely impacted by special charges of per share and favorably impacted by a decrease in the average share base of million shares from fiscal this decline in the share base was the result of the company s acquisition and retirement of million shares through two accelerated share repurchase transactions with million shares acquired during the first quarter and million shares acquired during the second quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
this reduction to the share base was partially offset by option exercises during the past twelve months and an increase in common stock equivalents of million for fiscal financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash from used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating cash flow declined during fiscal as increases in working capital offset an increase in net income and non cash adjustments 
cash used in investing activities increased billion primarily as a result of the acquisition of covansys corporation and first consulting group for cash of approximately billion 
net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately billion as a result of a long term debt offering during the fourth quarter for billion as well as the issuance of commercial paper 
operating cash flow as discussed above the decline in operating cash flow for fiscal was primarily due to increases in working capital 
operating cash flow for fiscal increased only slightly from fiscal working capital changes were as follows during fiscal the operating cash flow impact from changes in the company s receivables was a use of cash of million 
the increase in the company s accounts receivable  excluding acquired balances  was primarily in unbilled receivables which increased approximately million during fiscal this increase was primarily in the global commercial segment and was related to the timing of the work performed during the billing cycle and to unbilled amounts on long term contracts 
the five day increase in dso was the result of new receivables associated with new business awards in our european operations  increased receivables associated with nhs unbilled accounts  and the dilutive nature of mid year acquisitions on this ratio 
these effects were partially offset by improvements in collections in our north american operations 
for fiscal the use of cash as a result of increases in receivables was due to increases in billed trade accounts receivables and unbilled receivables of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in trade receivables was across both the north american public sector and the global commercial segments 
the increase in unbilled receivables related primarily to contracts in europe and us federal contracts 
the cash flow impact of changes in prepaid expenses and other assets was a use of cash of million for fiscal the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was the result of increases in work in process balances for fiscal of million  primarily in europe and the payment of a million bond to the irs to stop the accrual of interest on certain tax liabilities 
for fiscal the use of cash related to prepaid expenses and other current assets was a result of the company s investment in deferred costs and work in progress related to certain contracts which increased approximately million during fiscal compared to an increase of million in the prior year 
the majority of the work in process increases relate to the nhs contract 
activity in accounts payable and certain accrued expenses resulted in a use of cash of approximately million 
during fiscal accounts payable and certain accrued expenses decreased million from the prior year due to the reversal of income tax related interest and penalties accrued under fas prior to fiscal and the accrual of the income tax related interest and penalties as a tax liability as a result of the adoption of fin the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset in cash flow by an increase in accrued payroll of approximately million primarily due to timing of payments 
accounts payable and accrued expenses  combined  increased million for fiscal compared to a decrease of million for fiscal the increase in the balance for fiscal was the result of the timing of payments for accounts payable  which included an increase of approximately million for capital expenditure payables  an increase in accrued expenses for restructuring activities and activity on contracts 
activity in deferred income and advanced payments provided a cash inflow of approximately million for fiscal the increase was related to advanced contract payments in europe and the united states as well as sales of software licenses 
for fiscal cash provided was the result of advanced payments received from customers which increased approximately million during fiscal  primarily as a result of the achievement of billing milestones on a significant development effort for the nhs contract 
such balances partially offset the company s significant investment in this project 
the cash flow impact from changes in income tax liabilities and assets was a cash inflow of approximately million for fiscal additions to taxes payable during fiscal were somewhat offset by payments to tax authorities during the year of approximately million 
for fiscal and the company made payments for taxes of million and million  respectively 
the company projects cash payments for taxes to remain at fiscal levels for fiscal  however  resolution of tax contingencies could have a significant impact on such projections and cash tax payments 
deferred costs the company has submitted requests for equitable adjustment reas totaling approximately million on two us federal contracts which were later converted to interest bearing claims filed with the armed services board of contract appeals asbca 
included in current assets on the company s balance sheet is approximately million of unbilled accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the claims on the contracts 
csc has requested payment for certain related out of scope work directed or caused by the customers in support of their critical missions 
the contractual modification process for scope changes lagged behind the need for csc to provide critical on going operational support 
the company does not record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such reas 
the company believes it has valid bases for pursuing recovery of these reas claims supported by outside counsel s evaluation of the facts and assistance in preparation of the claims 
the company remains committed to vigorous pursuit of its claimed entitlements and associated value  and continues to believe based on review of applicable law and other considerations that recovery of at least its net balance sheet position is probable 
however  the company s position is subject to the ongoing evaluation of new facts and information which may come to the company s attention during the discovery phase of the litigation 
investing cash flow the company s capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that have supported the company s expanding global commercial operations in prior years 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premium 
investing cash out flows increased approximately billion during fiscal this increase in cash used for investing during fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of covansys corporation and first consulting group for cash 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cash paid  net of cash acquired  for these acquisitions was billion 
the remaining increase was  primarily  from purchases of computer equipment and deferred outsourcing contracts costs which increased million and million  respectively  during fiscal the increase in equipment was as a result of equipment replacements on contracts in europe and the united states while the increase in deferred outsourcing costs was as a result of new contracts in europe and in the north american public sector 
for fiscal the absence of significant new outsourcing contract awards during the latter part of fiscal and fiscal resulted in a reduction in investing cash outflows for computer equipment and related facilities costs and for outsourcing contract costs 
these reductions in cash outflows were partially offset by cash outflows for the acquisition of an identity management and credentialing business see note in notes to consolidated financial statements and an increase in cash outflows for purchase and development of software as a result of software purchases in europe  primarily for the national health service contract 
while increasing new business will typically require higher overall capital investments  the mix of the new business will also impact the level of capital 
the growth in us federal awards and the limited growth in commercial awards during fiscal are expected to limit the growth in overall capital investment in fiscal as us federal contracts typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts 
financing cash flow cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of billion from the prior year 
the inflow was primarily from the issuance of approximately billion of commercial paper  billion of which was refinanced with issuance of the million senior notes due and billion senior notes due this inflow was partially offset by an increase in outflows to acquire outstanding common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal the company increased its use of capital leases to finance certain equipment purchases related to long term contracts with total capital lease obligations of million as of march  in addition  the company funded the acquisition and retirement of outstanding shares from two accelerated share repurchase transactions during fiscal with approximately million of commercial paper and cash on hand 
the commercial paper was redeemed during fiscal using cash generated from operating activities 
during fiscal the company financed its capital investments primarily with cash generated from operations 
partially offsetting the financing cash outflows were cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at march    million at march   and  million at march  during fiscal  shareholders equity decreased million as a result of the company s repurchase of outstanding shares through a b share repurchase plan approved by the company s board of directors during fiscal and the impact of the adoption of fin as of the beginning of fiscal the share repurchase reduced shareholders equity by billion and the adoption of fin which reduced retained earnings million and additional paid in capital approximately million 
this reduction in shareholders equity was largely offset by  net income of million  an increase in the cumulative translation adjustment account of million due to the weak us dollar  an increase in the unfunded pension adjustment of million and the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase transaction initiated during fiscal with the receipt of million in cash 
exercises of employee stock options declined during fiscal as a result of the decline in the company s share price during the last half of fiscal at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  up from the ratio at the end of fiscal of  and from at the end of fiscal the increase in the debt ratio was the result of the issuance of billion of commercial paper which was converted into long term notes during fiscal to fund the acquisitions of covansys corporation and first consulting group  the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper during the fourth quarter to fund the completion of the b share repurchase plan  and the decrease in shareholders equity discussed above 
dollars in millions debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization the company purchased and retired approximately million outstanding common shares through a b share repurchase plan approved by the company s board of directors during fiscal at a cost or approximately billion 
this transaction was financed through available cash on hand and the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper which is currently outstanding 
the company s sources of liquidity include cash  commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements 
on july  the company entered into a new committed line of credit providing billion of long term commercial paper backup 
the line of credit expires on july  in addition the company entered into a short term billion line of credit to provide additional commercial paper backup on june  this line of credit expired upon the issuance of the million senior notes due and billion senior notes due if the company was unable to sell its commercial paper  borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit  or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned  the company has the ability to borrow under the committed line of credit 
the line of credit provides the option of being drawn at a base rate or a eurodollar rate 
this line requires the company to limit liens placed on our assets to million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than to  and not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
for further details on this agreement please see exhibit  which is incorporated by reference to this annual report 
as of march  the company s total liquidity was approximately billion which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and availability under the syndicated backstop credit facility of billion 
as of march   the company had no borrowings under these credit facilities and was in compliance with all terms of the agreements 
at march   the company had million of short term borrowings  million of current maturities of long term debt and billion of long term debt 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  commercial paper is classified as short term borrowings 
the current maturities of long term debt include the company s term notes with a face value of million due april  and the term notes with a face value of million due march the company plans to redeem these notes with the cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper during fiscal the company had million of outstanding commercial paper as of march  liquidity risk the company is exposed to liquidity risk from operations and from the company s ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets 
the company s exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant upfront investment 
recovery of this investment is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the company s performance as well as customer acceptance 
an example is the contract with the united kingdom s national health service to deliver an integrated electronic patient records system with an announced value of billion 
this is a large and complex contract 
as of march   the company had a net investment in the contract of approximately million 
contract assets were billion  principally contract work in progress and unbilled receivables but also equipment  software and other assets 
these are partially offset by liabilities for deferred revenue and advanced payments 
the contract is profitable and the company expects to recover its investment  however  unforeseen future events to the extent they add costs beyond the current estimates  including contingencies the company has provided for in its estimated costs to complete  could potentially adversely impact such recovery and the company s liquidity 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets at reasonable rates is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the company s financial position 
the company was successful in issuing billion of long term debt as a private placement under rule a during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  and unused short term borrowing capacity 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
the company has previously issued million worth of term debt from the shelf registration  leaving million of shelf available for additional securities 
as a result of the delay in filing its first and second quarter form q s during fiscal  the company will not be able to utilize the available shelf registration to issue additional securities until calendar months following the date which the fiscal second quarter form q was filed  which was january  the company was able to access the debt capital markets utilizing a rule a offering  as noted above 
however  there can be no assurances the company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of march  dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary debt guarantees total see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following table summarizes the company s payments on contractual obligations by period as of march  dollars in millions less than year years years more than years total long term debt interest on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations bank debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company adopted fin on march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined 
regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be zero in some years 
funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including erisa and cost accounting standards cas applied to us government contracts 
while there are certain minimum contribution requirements  csc may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments  changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal company contributions amounted to million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates 
revenue from our fixed unit price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time 
however  for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting  which is less than eight percent of the company s revenues  the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation 
under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved 
costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we routinely negotiate such contract modifications in both the us federal and global commercial segments 
many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers 
the total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value 
these relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine income tax expense we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for acquiree integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
for fiscal and  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return  for all plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time 
for csc  market returns caused actual pension plan asset returns to lag and exceed those expected in fiscal and  respectively 
rising discount rates in fiscal  which resulted in lower benefit obligation growth  served to enhance the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal declining discount rates in fiscal and  which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations  served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns in fiscal and for fiscal and  sfas no 
requires recognition of a pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the projected benefit obligation pbo at the end of the year 
at the end of fiscal  a number of our pension plans had pbos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  but due mostly to higher discount rates  lower pension obligations were recognized in than in the effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal was to decrease pension liability by million  increase non current asset by million  and decrease accumulated comprehensive loss by million million net of taxes 
for fiscal  a number of our pension plans had pbos in excess of their plan assets fair value  thus requiring adjustments to increase pension liability by million  decrease intangible assets by million  decrease non current asset by million  and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by million million net of taxes 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional charges to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt 
foreign currency as a large global organization the company faces exposure to adverse movements in the foreign currency exchange rates 
during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  as business practices evolve the company is increasing its use of offshore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations 
the company established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
these financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year 
in addition  the company uses these instruments as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes 
for accounting purposes  these foreign currency contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses 
in fiscal year  the company also entered into foreign currency options to manage their exposure to the economic risk from movements in the rupee against the us dollar from the company s offshore support base in india 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk  the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects on the fair value of our hedge portfolio 
given a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies  the company would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at march   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
