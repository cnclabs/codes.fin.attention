item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents the following tables set forth certain information with respect to stores and pharmacies for each of the last five fiscal years stores open at beginning of period stores opened acquired during period stores closed during period stores open at end of period number of stores with pharmacies at end of period square feet of selling space at end of period in thousands average square feet of selling space per store franchise stores at end of period fred s xpress designation the term xpress is given to a location that is intended to transition to a typical fred s store 
these locations range in size from  to  square feet  and enable the company to enter a new market with an initial investment of under  these locations typically sell only pharmaceuticals and other health and beauty related items 
xpress locations usually originate from an acquisition and are in a location that is not suitable for the typical layout of a fred s store 
therefore  the new store location is given the xpress designation  and is marked for conversion to a typical fred s store once a suitable location can be obtained 
the xpress designation is not a business strategy or a new line of business 
it is simply a way of describing a small number of atypical stores in our chain that are awaiting conversion to a typical larger fred s store layout 
in all other ways  including resource allocation  management  training  marketing and corporate support  it is treated just as any other location in the chain 
given their smaller physical size  however  they are not stocked with the full breadth of merchandise in all departments that are carried by our other stores 
within the population of xpress locations  acquisitions are routinely being added and stores are being converted as suitable locations are found 
at any given time the company has approximately stores that are designated as xpress locations 
due to the small number of stores in transition relative to our total store population  xpress stores represent a small portion of our sales and gross profit 
xpress sales  as a percentage of totals sales  for   and were   and  respectively  and gross profit  as a percentage of total gross profit for the same time period was   and  respectively 
merchandising and marketing the business in which the company is engaged is highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors include location of stores  price and quality of merchandise  in stock consistency  merchandise assortment and presentation  and customer service 
the company competes for sales and store locations in varying degrees with national  regional and local retailing establishments  including department stores  discount stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores 
many of the largest retail merchandising companies in the nation have stores in areas in which the company operates 
management believes that fred s has a distinctive niche in that it offers a wider variety of merchandise at a more attractive price to value relationship than either a drug store or smaller variety dollar store and is more shopper convenient than a larger discount store 
the variety and depth of merchandise 
table of contents offered in high traffic departments  such as health and beauty aids and paper and cleaning supplies  are comparable to those of larger discount retailers 
management believes that its knowledge of regional and local consumer preferences  developed over its year history  enables the company to compete very effectively in its region 
purchasing the company s primary buying activities other than prescription drug buying are directed from the corporate office by the executive vice president and general merchandise manager through three divisional senior vice presidents of merchandising who are supported by a staff of buyers and assistants 
the buyers and assistants are participants in an incentive compensation program  which is based upon various factors primarily relating to gross margin return on inventory 
the company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and import suppliers 
many of the import suppliers generally require long lead times and orders are placed four to six months in advance of delivery 
these products are either imported directly by us or acquired from distributors based in the united states and their purchase prices are denominated in united states dollars 
the merchandising department manages all replenishment and forecasting functions with the company s open to buy reports generated by proprietary software 
the merchandising department develops vendor line reviews  assortment planning and the testing of new products and programs to continually improve overall inventory productivity and in stock positions 
the company purchased approximately in  in and in of the company s warehouse purchases from procter and gamble 
the company believes that adequate alternative sources of products are available for these categories of merchandise 
during  all of the company s prescription drugs were ordered by its pharmacies individually and shipped direct from the company s primary pharmaceutical wholesaler amerisourcebergen corporation bergen 
bergen provides substantially all of the company s prescription drugs 
during   and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total purchases were made from bergen 
although there are alternative wholesalers that supply pharmaceutical products  the company operates under a purchase and supply contract with bergen as its primary wholesaler 
accordingly  the unplanned loss of this particular supplier could have a short term gross margin impact on the company s business until an alternative wholesaler arrangement could be implemented 
excluding the purchases made from our pharmaceutical supplier and those made from proctor and gamble mentioned previously  no other supplier accounted for more than of the company s total purchases for the years   and sales mix the company s sales  which occur through company owned stores and to franchised fred s stores  constitute a single reportable operating segment 
the company s sales mix by major category for the preceding three years was as follows 
table of contents for the year ended february  february  january  pharmaceuticals household goods apparel and linens food and tobacco products health and beauty aids paper and cleaning supplies sales to franchised fred s stores total sales mix the sales mix varies from store to store depending upon local consumer preferences and whether the stores include pharmacies and or a full line of apparel 
in  the average customer transaction size for comparable stores was approximately  and the number of customer transactions totaled approximately million 
the average transaction size was approximately in and in our private label program includes household cleaning supplies  health and beauty aids  disposable diapers  pet foods  paper products and a variety of beverage and other products 
private label products sold constituted approximately of total sales for the years   and private label products afford the company higher than average gross margins while providing the customer with lower priced products that are of a quality comparable to that of competing branded products 
an independent laboratory testing program is used for substantially all of the company s private label products 
as part of our strategic plan  we intend to expand our private label program 
for a complete discussion  reference item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the company sells merchandise to its franchised fred s stores 
these sales during the last three years totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in franchise and other fees earned totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred s name and administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores 
the company does not intend to expand its franchise network  and therefore  expects that this category will continue to decrease as a percentage of the company s total revenues 
advertising and promotions net advertising and promotion costs represented approximately of net sales in and  and in the company uses direct mail  television  radio and major newspaper advertising circulars  one at the first of each month and two during the christmas season 
the company utilizes page full color circulars coordinated by an internal advertising staff to promote its merchandise  special promotional events and a discount retail image 
additionally  the company retains an outside advertising agency to assist with radio and television promotions  and to develop and implement the company s branding strategy 
the company s buyers have discretion to mark down slow moving items 
the company runs regular clearances of seasonal merchandise and conducts sales and promotions of particular items 
the company also encourages its store managers to create in store advertising displays and signage in order to increase customer traffic and impulse purchases 
store managers have the flexibility to tailor the price structure at their particular store to meet competitive conditions within each store s marketing area 

table of contents store operations all fred s stores are open six days a week monday through saturday  and most stores are open seven days a week other than the pharmacy 
store hours are generally from am to am  however  certain stores are open only until pm each fred s store is managed by a full time store manager and those stores with a pharmacy employ a full time pharmacist 
the company s district managers and regional vice presidents supervise the management and operation of fred s stores 
fred s operates pharmacies as of february   which offer brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and are staffed by licensed pharmacists 
the addition of acquired pharmacies in the company s stores has resulted in increased store sales and sales per selling square foot 
management believes that the pharmacy department  in addition to the other merchandise departments  increases customer traffic and repeat visits and is an integral part of the store s operation 
the company has an incentive compensation plan for store managers  pharmacists and district managers based on meeting or exceeding targeted profit percentage contributions 
various factors included in determining profit percentage contribution are gross profits and controllable expenses at the store level 
these factors of operating performance are reviewed regularly by executive management to pinpoint developments in key performance areas 
management believes that this incentive compensation plan  together with the company s store management training program  are instrumental in maximizing store performance 
the company s training program covers all aspects of the company s operation from product knowledge to handling customers with courtesy 
inventory control and distribution inventory control the company s centralized management information system maintains a daily stock keeping unit sku level inventory and current and historical sales information for each store and the distribution centers 
this system is supported by our in store point of sale pos system  which captures sku and other data at the time of sale 
the merchandising arm of the system uses the data received from the stores to provide integrated inventory management  automated replenishment  promotional planning  space management  and merchandise planning 
the company conducts annual inventory counts at all fred s stores and has implemented the use of radio frequency devices rf guns to conduct cycle counts to insure replenishment accuracy 
distribution the company has an  square foot centralized distribution center in memphis  tennessee that services stores and a  square foot distribution center in dublin  georgia that services stores see properties below 
approximately of the merchandise received by fred s stores in was shipped through these distribution centers  with the remainder primarily pharmaceuticals  certain snack food items  greeting cards  beverages and tobacco products being shipped directly to the stores by suppliers 
for distribution  the company uses owned and leased trailers and tractors  as well as common carriers 
the company s warehouse management system is completely automated and provides conveyor control and pick  pack and ship processes by using portable radio frequency terminals 
this system is integrated with the company s centralized management information system to provide up to date perpetual records as well as facilitating merchandise allocation and distribution decisions 
the company uses cycle counts through out the year to insure accuracy within the warehouse management system 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in that the company s sales volume is heavier around the st of the calendar month 
many of the customers who shop at fred s stores rely on government aid  social security  and other means that are typically paid at the st of the month 
these governmental payment cycles coupled with the distribution of our newspaper advertising circular are major factors in concentrating sales earlier in the calendar month 
generally  the highest volume of sales and net income occur in the fourth fiscal quarter  coincident with the 
table of contents holiday shopping season 
the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales  gross profit  operating income  and net income by quarter 
all of the quarters below are comprised of weeks except for the th quarter of fiscal which is comprised of weeks due to the week year ending february  st nd rd th for the year ended quarter quarter quarter quarter february  net sales gross profit operating profit loss net income loss february  net sales gross profit operating profit net income january  net sales gross profit operating profit net income results for include certain charges for the planned closing of stores see item exit and disposal activities section and implementations of fin employees at february   the company had approximately  full time and part time employees  comprised of  corporate and distribution center employees and  store employees 
the number of employees varies during the year  reaching a peak during the christmas selling season  which typically begins after the thanksgiving holiday 
only the memphis  tennessee distribution center employees are represented by the unite here union pursuant to a three year collective bargaining agreement which went into effect on july  the company believes that it continues to have good relations with all of its employees 
competition the discount retail merchandise business is highly competitive 
we compete in respect to price  store location  in stock consistency  merchandise quality  assortment and presentation  and customer service with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores 
our competitors range from smaller  growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we do 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with them in the future

these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
as a provider of medicare prescription drug plan benefits  we are subject to various federal regulations promulgated by the center for medicare and medicaid services under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in the future we may also be subject to various state insurance laws and regulations in connection with the company s pharmacy operations

risk factors 
table of contents investors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to fred s securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management  or that management currently deems immaterial  may also impair the company s business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that instance  the trading price of fred s securities could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
the company s business is somewhat seasonal 
the company typically realizes a significant portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter 
our inventories and short term borrowings increase in anticipation of this holiday season 
a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason the company s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns  especially in seasonal merchandise 
the company operates in a competitive industry 
the company is in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail merchandise business 
this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices  and lower margins  required to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores  some of whom may have greater resources than the company 
this competitive environment subjects the company to various risks  including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow the company to maintain profitability and continue its store growth 
some of the company s competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities  advertising programs  and pricing discounts and the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company does not respond effectively to these efforts 
changes in third party reimbursements  including government programs  could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of the company s sales is funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
for the years ended february  and february   approximately of our sales were derived from pharmaceutical sales 
the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions 
payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost 
private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates 
accordingly  reimbursements may be limited or reduced  thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows 
additionally  government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 
changes in consumer demand and product mix  and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix 
a general slowdown in the united states economy  rising personal debt levels  rising foreclosure rates  rising fuel prices  or changes in government aid  social security  and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of the company s consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales  product mix and margins 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  inflation  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect the company s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
the company might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement 
table of contents appropriate inventory strategies  which would adversely affect its sales and gross profit performance 
in addition  continued increases in fuel and energy costs would increase the company s transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect the company s financial statements as a whole 
natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business 
unusually adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or similar disruptions  could significantly reduce the company s net sales 
in addition  these disruptions could also adversely affect the company s supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers 
a number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornados 
merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business 
the company has maintained good relations with its vendors and believes that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers  principally in the far east 
as a result  political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to or duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs 
also  our cost of these goods is affected by the fluctuation of the local currencies where these goods are produced against the dollar 
accordingly  changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and  if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers  decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings 
the company purchases a significant amount of goods from proctor and gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact the company s operations and results 
delays and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business 
the company maintains two distribution facilities in its geographic territory  and plans on constructing new facilities as needed to support its growth 
one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
the company plans on expanding and refreshing its network of stores through opening new stores and remodeling existing stores each year 
delays in opening stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect the company s future operations by slowing growth  which may in turn reduce revenue growth 
adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores  such as changes in labor  utilities  fuel and transportation  and other operating costs  could have an adverse impact on the company 
operational difficulties could disrupt our business 
the company s stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel 
inability of the company to effectively and efficiently operate its stores  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage  may negatively impact the company s sales and or margin 
in addition  the company relies upon its distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost effective manner  any disruption  unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact store operations 
the company s operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed 
the company relies on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate its operations information 
the disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact the company s operations 
use of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business 
the company has a long term supply contract from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  for our pharmaceutical operations 
any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier  deterioration in their financial condition  changes in terms  or an industry wide change in wholesale business practices  including those of our supplier  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 

table of contents higher costs and achievement of targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs  systems and technology could adversely affect our business 
the company is undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as infrastructure initiatives 
the failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the company 
changes in state or federal legislation or regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs  trade restrictions  tariffs  quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact the company s ability to achieve its financial targets 
changes in trade restrictions  new tariffs and quotas  and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact the ability of the company to achieve anticipated operating results 
we depend on the success of new store opening program for company growth and profitability 
the company s growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores 
unavailability of store locations that the company deems attractive  delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores  difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact the company s new store growth  the costs associated with new stores and or the profitability of new stores 
changes in the company s ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
the growth of the company could be adversely impacted by its inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level  in distribution facilities  and at the corporate level  including the company s senior management team 
adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact the company s ability to achieve its operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to its employees 
adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business 
the company is party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims  including those described elsewhere in this report 
operating results for the company could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against the company are made  requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business 
our ability to achieve the results of our strategic plan initiatives 
on february   the company announced a strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin by closing under performing stores  which is discussed in detail in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors  including the timing of execution  the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties  or unexpected costs  any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan 
increases in our insurance related costs could significantly affect our business 
the costs of many types of insurance and self insurance  especially workers compensation  employee health care and others  have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings  and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
we also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers  including some who operate in foreign countries  which could 
table of contents become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage 
while we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices  no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise 
should a product liability issue arise  the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our insurance related costs increase significantly  or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected

store locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
four hundred and thirty nine of the locations are in strip centers or adjacent to a downtown shopping district  with the remainder being freestanding 
it is anticipated that existing buildings and buildings to be developed by others will be available for lease to satisfy the company s expansion program in the near term 
it is management s intention to enter into leases of relatively moderate length with renewal options  rather than entering into long term leases 
the company will thus have maximum relocation flexibility in the future  since continued availability of existing buildings is anticipated in the company s market areas 
the company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters situated on approximately acres in memphis  tennessee 
the site contains the distribution center with approximately  square feet of space  and  square feet of office and retail space

item legal proceedings in june  a lawsuit entitled sarah ziegler  et al 
v 
fred s discount store was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama in which the plaintiff alleges that she and other current and former fred s discount assistant store managers were improperly classified as exempt executive employees under the fair labor standards act flsa and seeks to recover overtime pay  liquidated damages  and attorneys fees and court cost 
in july  the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to facilitate notice pursuant to the flsa that would give current and former assistant manager s information about their rights to opt in to the lawsuit 
after initially denying the motion  in october  the judge granted plaintiffs motion to facilitate notice pursuant to the flsa 
notice was sent to some  current and former assistant store managers and approximately persons opted into the case

following the close of the discovery period in this case  the company will have an opportunity to seek decertification of the class  and the company expects to file such a decertification and other motions 
in addition to the matter described above  the company is party to other pending legal proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business

our merchandise refresher program was completed during the third quarter of this program refreshed the look and feel of our stores with new paint and flooring  updated signage and the expansion and relocation of several departments 
additionally  our new branding and advertising campaign  which focuses on our over year history while emphasizing the new look and feel of fred s continued to be a key strategy as the year drew to a close 
two additional strategies that will be key to our success in continued to be focal points in the second half of the first involves an extensive market research program to determine customer preferences and expectations when visiting a fred s store and the second involves a new site selection and real estate program to determine which locations best suit our customers 
another key element of our strategic plan that began to unfold in the latter part of was the introduction of new leadership  as well as an internal realignment of existing leadership 
continuing enhancements to or changes in our leadership team will also be focal points in the integration of the aforementioned strategies coupled with our unique store layout allows us to offer our customers all the attractive elements of a discount dollar store  drug store and mass merchant under one roof 
by offering elements of all three types of businesses  we are able to provide our customers with a ten minute superstore experience in a smaller  easier and more convenient store layout 
the company continued during the year to see paybacks on productivity improvements and key technology initiatives 
some of these include continuing enhancement of our point of sale and radio frequency rf store systems  refinement and upgrades to our merchandise planning and allocation systems and process and productivity standards improvements in our distribution centers 
as discussed in our form k for the fiscal year ended february   we slowed our new store growth during the year 
this slow down in growth  coupled with the closing of unproductive stores  should have a positive impact on the company s operating margin over time 
in  the company opened new stores and closed stores 
the majority of our new store openings were in mississippi  georgia  texas and north and south carolina 
we did not enter into any new states during the year 
additionally  we opened eleven new pharmacies and closed four pharmacies throughout the course of the year 
during  the company will continue with its strategy of slowing growth and closing underperforming stores 
pursuant to this strategy  fred s expects to open new stores and new pharmacies while closing underperforming stores and pharmacies 
by closing underperforming locations  the company intends to improve its cash flow and operating margin  both of which are core goals of the company s overall strategic plan 
also in  we will focus on building our private label line of products which should build and solidify customer loyalty while simultaneously increasing gross margin 
we are currently developing additional private label brand names that we believe the customer will find appealing and will become synonymous with fred s promise to deliver quality products at low prices 

table of contents our battleship store program which was developed late in will be operational in early and is intended to sharpen focus on our upper tier of profit producing stores 
the intention of this program is to reward our customers with additional benefits such as expanded selections of products  one time or one of a kind type items  or special events such as treasure hunts or outdoor activities 
customer and employee appreciation are key tenants of the battleship program 
we will also continue in to focus on the items we refer to as our we got it items 
these are consumable type items that we have promised  through our we got it branding campaign  to always have on our shelves and available for our customers 
we have implemented supply chain and distribution procedures to ensure that our we got it pledge is fulfilled 
over the course of  we intend to continue with capital improvements in infrastructure  including new and existing store expansions and remodels  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities 
technology upgrades will be made in the areas of direct store delivery systems  stores pos systems  and pharmacy systems 
key factors that will be critical to the company s future success include managing the strategy for opening new stores and pharmacies  including the ability to open and operate efficiently  maintaining high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  controlling the effects of inflation  especially in regard to occupancy costs  increasing operating margin through improved gross margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s expansion 
additionally  managing the store closing process effectively and efficiently will be a key factor in delivering projected benefits in and beyond 
other factors that will affect company performance in include the continuing management of the impacts of the changing regulatory environment in which our pharmacy department operates  especially the anticipated implementation of the federally approved change in pricing of generic pharmaceuticals to average manufacturer s price amp  which could negatively affect gross margin 
additionally  inflated oil and gas prices continue to have a negative impact on our business in terms of reducing our customer s disposable income  as well as increasing the cost of our petroleum based products and increasing our transportation costs 
we also believe that the current housing crisis is having an impact on the disposable income of our customers and will continue to do so well into also  the company will again experience an initial negative impact in selling  general and administrative expenses from the second year incremental raising of the federal minimum wage  however  the increase should be a positive factor over time because it will directly impact the disposable income of our primary customer base 
we also believe that the economic stimulus package of and lower interest rates could be positive factors and may benefit our customers in the upcoming year 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  but has tended to experience less seasonal fluctuation than many other retailers due to the mix of everyday basic merchandise and pharmacy business 
our fiscal fourth quarter is typically the most profitable quarter because it includes the christmas selling season 
the overall strength of the fourth quarter is partially mitigated  however  by the inclusion of the month of january  which is generally the least profitable month of the year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements and the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company markets goods and services through company owned stores and franchised stores as of february  net sales include sales of merchandise from company owned stores  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
sales to franchised stores are recorded when the merchandise is shipped from the company s warehouse 
revenues resulting from layaway sales are recorded upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
the company also sells gift cards for which the revenue is recognized at time of redemption 
the company records a gift card liability on the date the gift card is issued to the customer 
revenue is recognized and the gift card liability is reduced as the customer redeems the gift card 
the company will recognize as revenue when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote gift card breakage 
the company has not recognized any revenue from gift card breakage since the inception of the program in may and does not expect to record any gift card breakage revenue until there is more certainty regarding our ability to retain such amounts in light of current consumer protection and state escheatment laws 
in addition  the company charges the franchised stores a fee based on a percentage of their purchases from the company 
these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred s name and other administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores and are therefore netted against selling  general and administrative expenses 
total franchise income for   and was   and  respectively 
inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out fifo method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  after applying the cost to retail ratio  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value market value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink  there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses shrink is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  and as such the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk that this estimate in the determination of the cost value of inventory 

table of contents the company calculates inventory losses shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the company has not experienced any significant change in shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year during the subject reporting periods 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which were approximately million  and million at february  and february   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at february  and million at february  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million  million  and million  during   and  respectively 
the company has historically included an estimate of inbound freight and certain general and administrative expenses in merchandise inventory as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
these costs include activities surrounding the procurement and storage of merchandise inventory such as buying  warehousing  and accounting  as well as inbound freight 
during the second quarter which ended august   we revised our estimate to include certain costs internally captured within our merchandise planning  information technology and human resources departments as they relate to the inventory functions and support of procurement and storage 
this revision follows growth in the role of these departments in support of the procurement and warehousing functions  including additional personnel hired over the past few quarters 
further  our merchandise planning department has evolved from being previously included within the buying function to a stand alone function with responsibility for inbound logistics and commodity procurement 
the total amount of expenses and inbound freight included in merchandise inventory at february  is million  with the corresponding amount of million at february  impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores open or remodeled more than two years 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the 
table of contents fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets or other reasonable estimates of fair market value based upon management s judgment 
exit and disposal activities 
during the year ended february   the company recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million in cost of goods sold to value inventory at the lower of cost or market and a charge of million in selling  general and administrative expense for the impairment of fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with the planned closure of stores in the upcoming fiscal year 
the planned closures will take place during the first three quarters of the upcoming year and are the result of an in depth study conducted by the company of its operations over the last quarters 
the study revealed that fred s has a strong and healthy store base  and that by closing these underperforming stores the company will improve it s cash flow and operating margin  both of which are core goals of the company s overall strategic plan 
with the successful execution of this plan  the company will become stronger and will be in a better position to respond to fluctuations in the economy and take advantage of opportunities to further improve our business 
also during the year ended february   the company utilized the million reserve that was taken as a below cost inventory adjustment and charged to cost of goods sold in the year ended february  for store closures that took place during the current year 
in addition  the company completed its exit from the boys and girls apparel lines and as such utilized the reserve of million that was taken as a below cost inventory adjustment and charged to cost of goods sold in the year ended february  the following table summarizes the current year balances and activity of the liabilities associated with the aforementioned exit and disposal activities beginning reversal for stores additional ending balance utilized during not closed during reserves added balance in millions february  february  inventory markdowns for discontinuance of boys girls apparel inventory markdowns for planned store closings lease contract termination costs for store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the cease use date when the store is closed in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
liabilities are established at the cease use date for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by sfas key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements  estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations  and estimation of other related exit costs 
if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates  the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts 
these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
associated with the store closings in the current year  the company incurred million in lease contract termination cost  which was charged to rent expense  and expects to incur million in lease contract termination costs in association with the stores that are planned to be closed in the upcoming year 

table of contents property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital leases are depreciated in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
vendor rebates and allowances 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of february   the company had approximately vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within three months to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 reporting on advertising costs aicpa sop  the company charges advertising  including production costs  to selling  general and administrative expense on the first day of the advertising period 
gross advertising expenses for   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
gross advertising expenses were reduced by vendor cooperative advertising allowances of million  million  and 
million  for   and  respectively 
it would be the company s intention to incur a similar amount of advertising expense as in prior years and in support of our stores even if we did not receive support from our vendors in the form of cooperative adverting programs 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have 
table of contents been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company carries additional coverage for excessive or catastrophic claims with stop loss limits of  for property and general liability and  for employee medical 
the company s insurance reserve was million and million on february  and february   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with reserve utilization of million 
income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we adopted fin as of february   the first day of fiscal this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million decrease to beginning retained earnings and a reclassification of certain amounts between deferred income taxes million decrease and other non current liabilities million increase  including million of interest and penalties to conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements of fin the company increased the gross reserve for uncertain tax positions from million to million  a change of million to disclose the gross liability rather than reflect the liability net of federal income tax benefit 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions balance at february  additions for tax position related to current year additions for tax position of prior years reductions for tax position of prior years settlements balance at february  as of february   our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  of which million and million were recognized as income tax benefit during the periods ending november  and february   respectively  as a result of a lapse in applicable statute of limitations 
as of february   our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet with other liabilities  all of which  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
fin further requires that interest required to be paid by the tax law on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements 
the company includes potential interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fin in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense 
as of february   accrued interest and penalties related to 
table of contents our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively  and are both recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non current liabilities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized post adoption includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
in november  fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp fas r 
effective january   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fsp fas r for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required prior to sfas r 
the impact of adopting sfas r on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based payments using the intrinsic value based recognition method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 
as stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  no stock option compensation expense was reflected in net income prior to adopting sfas r 
stock based compensation expense  post adoption of sfas r  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for periods prior to  the company in its proforma disclosures under sfas  recognized forfeitures as they occurred 
the following represents total stock based compensation expense a component of selling  general and administrative expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements in thousands stock option expense restricted stock expense espp expense total stock based compensation income tax benefit on stock based compensation 
table of contents as a result of adopting sfas r  the company s income before income taxes and net income for fiscal year  were million and million lower  respectively  than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year were 
and 
lower respectively  than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb the company uses the modified black scholes option valuation model bsm to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
the bsm option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock volatility and option life 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the bsm with the following weighted average assumptions pro forma stock options expected volatility risk free interest rate expected option life in years expected dividend yield weighted average fair value at grant date employee stock purchase plan expected volatility risk free interest rate expected option life in years expected dividend yield weighted average fair value at grant date the following is a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption expected volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of our stock to calculate expected price volatility because management believes that this is the best indicator of future volatility 
the company calculates weekly market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the yield of a us treasury zero coupon bond issue effective at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected lives this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience 
options granted have a maximum term of seven and one half years 
an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense 

table of contents dividend yield this is based on the historical yield for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeiture rate this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested 
this estimate is based on historical experience 
an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense 
equity incentive plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding equity incentive plans 
results of operations the following table provides a comparison of fred s financial results for the past three years 
in this table  categories of income and expense are expressed as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended february  february  january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before taxes income taxes net income cost of goods sold includes the cost of the product sold  along with all costs associated with inbound freight 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with purchasing  receiving  handling  securing  and storing product 
these costs are associated with products that have been sold and no longer remain in ending inventory 
results for the year ended february  and february   include certain charges for the planned closing of stores in and the stores closed in see item  exit and disposal activities section 
comparable sales our policy regarding the calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for stores that have been opened after the end of the twelfth month following the store s grand opening month  including stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 
additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments 
table of contents within a fred s store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth 
therefore  the introduction of all new departments is included in same store sales in the year in which the department is introduced 
likewise  our same store sales calculation is not adjusted for the removal of a department from a location 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales increased million in approximately million of the increase was attributable to a net addition of new stores  and a net addition of pharmacies during  together with the sales of store locations and pharmacies that were opened or upgraded during and contributed a full year of sales in during  the company closed stores and pharmacy locations

fred s pharmacy sales were of total sales in and of total sales in and continue to rank as the largest sales category within the company 
the total sales in this department  including the company s mail order operation  increased over  with third party prescription sales representing approximately of total pharmacy sales  the same as in the prior year 
the company s pharmacy sales growth continued to benefit from an ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies and the addition of pharmacy departments in existing store locations 
sales to fred s franchised locations increased approximately million in and represented of the company s total sales  the same as in the increase in sales to franchised locations results primarily from the sales volume increases experienced by the franchise locations during the year 
it is anticipated that this category of business will continue to decline as a percentage of total company sales since the company has not added and does not intend to add any additional franchisees 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross margin results primarily from the million below cost inventory adjustment associated with the planned closure of under performing stores in an improvement in the pharmacy department s gross margin due to a greater percentage of generic dispensing offset lower general merchandise margins in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in the increase as a percent of net sales was from the recording of million for asset impairments for the planned closure of under performing stores  increased payroll cost of million  increased property rents of million  higher utilities of million  and increased legal and professional cost of million

the company s estimates of income taxes and the significant items resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and reflect the company s assessment of future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns for each taxing authority in which it operates 
actual income taxes to be paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the outcome of audits completed by federal and state taxing authorities 
the reserves are determined based upon the company s judgment of the probable outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances 
state net operating loss carry forwards are available to reduce state income taxes in future years 
these carry forwards total approximately million for state income tax purposes and expire at various times during through if certain substantial changes in the company s ownership should occur  there would be an annual limitation on the amount of carry forwards that can be utilized 
we have provided a reserve for the portion believed to be more likely than not to expire unused 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal to from fiscal and fiscal levels due to the expiration of federal credits for jobs in the hurricane impact zone and the mid year end expiration of state tax incentives offered by georgia
