item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered and self managed reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned properties  one of which is held for sale  held a tenancy in common interest in one property  and participated in five joint ventures that owned a total of five properties including one vacant property held for sale 
these properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we have borrowed funds in the past to finance the purchase of real estate and we expect to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property  including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
although we investigated  analyzed and bid on several properties in  due to a variety of factors  including increased competition and unfavorable prices  we did not acquire any properties in in january and february  we acquired two single retail properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
our five joint ventures each held a single tenant property as of december  at year end  our equity investment in our joint ventures was million  net of distributions 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and in addition  we had one loan payable outstanding with a principal amount of million  bearing interest at and maturing in results of operations outlook we anticipate that in we will use any available cash after taking into account required cash distributions to shareholders  funds derived from the placement of additional mortgages and a credit line to acquire additional properties  either directly or through joint ventures 
as a result  we anticipate that we will acquire and own additional properties and unless we experience an unexpected number of lease terminations and or cancellations in taking into consideration the lease expiration we know will occur in  and without giving effect to any re letting of such properties  our revenues should increase in comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on properties acquired by us between april and december operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties between april and december general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to a number of factors including i an increase of  in payroll and payroll related expenses of full time employees  ii an increase of  in compensation expenses related to the amortization of restricted stock awards  iii an increase of  from  to  in the compensation paid to the chairman of our board  iv an increase of  in professional fees resulting from both the retention by our compensation committee of an independent consultant  and an increase in legal and accounting fees 
offsetting these increases was a  decease in professional fees incurred in the prior year in connection with investigations by the sec and our audit committee and legal fees relating to a civil litigation arising out of the activities of our former president and chief executive officer 
included in the increase in general and administrative expenses was million of expenses incurred pursuant to a compensation and services agreement which became effective january  under the agreement majestic property management corp  an affiliated entity  took over our obligations under a shared services agreement including our share of direct office overhead and agreed to continue to provide us with the services of all affiliated executive  administrative  legal  accounting and clerical personnel that we use on an as needed  part time basis 
accordingly  we no longer allocate direct office overhead or allocate payroll expenses 
the agreement also requires majestic property management corp 
to continue to provide us with certain property management services including construction supervisory services  property acquisition  sales and leasing services and mortgage brokerage services and we do not incur any fees or expenses for such services except for the annual fee referred to below 
in consideration of taking over our obligations under the shared services agreement and providing the services mentioned above  we agreed to pay majestic property management corp 
a fee in of  million before offsets provided for in the agreement plus  as our share of direct office overhead

interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase results primarily from fixed rate mortgages placed on properties in the year ended december  and the assumption of a fixed rate mortgage in connection with the purchase of properties in april the year ended december  includes a full year of interest expense on these mortgages

such sales also contributed to an operating income decrease from these ventures of million  of which  was our share  caused by a decrease in rental income  offset in part by a decrease in mortgage interest expense and depreciation 
the decrease in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures also resulted from a  provision for valuation adjustment  of which  or  was our share  by one of our joint ventures which owns a vacant property

the increase in discontinued operations also resulted from an increase in income from operations caused by a  provision for valuation adjustment that was recorded in the year ended december  against one of the properties which was sold later in that year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities  including mortgage financings 
we are a party to a credit agreement  as amended  with vnb new york corp  bank leumi  usa  manufacturers and traders trust company and israel discount bank of new york which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to us to pay off existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus or the bank s prime rate and there is an unused facility fee of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
as of december  and march   there is no outstanding balance under the facility 
we continue to seek additional property acquisitions 
we will use our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations  cash provided from mortgage financings and funds available under our credit facility to fund acquisitions 
the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages and loan payable interest and amortization mortgages and loan payable balances due at maturity total as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage and loan indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated to pay rent under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows more than total years we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  recognition of impairment is required if the calculated value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation adjustment  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
all of our long term mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit line is a variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
therefore  our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our line of credit 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
the fair market value fmv of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fmv at december  amounts in thousands there for the year ended december after total fmv long term debt fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate
