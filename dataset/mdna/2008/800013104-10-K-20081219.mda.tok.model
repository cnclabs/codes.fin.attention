general the company s poultry operations are integrated through its control of all functions relative to the production of its chicken products  including hatching egg production  hatching  feed manufacturing  raising chickens to marketable age grow out  processing and marketing 
consistent with the poultry industry  the company s profitability is substantially impacted by the market price for its finished products and feed grains  both of which may fluctuate 
table of contents substantially and exhibit cyclical characteristics typically associated with commodity markets 
other costs  excluding feed grains  related to the profitability of the company s poultry operations  including hatching egg production  hatching  growing  and processing cost  are responsive to efficient cost containment programs and management practices 
over the past three fiscal years  these other normal production costs have averaged approximately of the company s total normal production costs 
the company believes that value added products are subject to less price volatility and generate higher  more consistent profit margin than whole chickens ice packed and shipped in bulk form 
to reduce its exposure to market cyclicality that has historically characterized commodity chicken market prices  the company has increasingly concentrated on the production and marketing of value added product lines with emphasis on product quality  customer service  and brand recognition 
the company adds value to its poultry products by performing one or more processing steps beyond the stage where the whole chicken is first saleable as a finished product  such as cutting  deep chilling  packaging and labeling the product 
the company believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to change its product mix to meet customer demands 
the company s prepared chicken product line includes approximately institutional and consumer packaged chicken items that it sells nationally  primarily to distributors and food service establishments 
a majority of the prepared chicken items are made to the specifications of food service users

executive overview of results market prices for poultry products were mixed during fiscal when compared to fiscal  and the cost of corn and soybean meal were at historically high levels during fiscal  resulting in lower margins 
the company s cost of feed grains was approximately million higher during fiscal compared to fiscal these higher feed costs added approximately cents per pound to the cost of a pound of chicken 
the company s results for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflect the fact that prices for the company s poultry products did not move in tandem with the higher grain costs  which made up approximately of the company s cost of goods sold during fiscal while feed costs increased more than cents per pound  the company s sales price of poultry products only increased cents per pound 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and industry experienced decreasing prices for boneless breast meat resulting from weak demand from food service and significantly lower prices for chicken leg quarters for the export market as a result of the current world financial crises and the resulting tightening credit markets 
the company cannot predict if or when input costs will return to historical levels  or when chicken prices will move to a level allowing the company to offset such costs and return to historical margins 
the company believes that the cost of feed grains will continue to be relatively high during fiscal  as the demand for corn from ethanol producers  export markets  protein producers  and concerns about adequate supply might continue to affect the market prices for both corn and soybeans 
however  corn and soy meal prices have declined recently 
if the company were to price all of its remaining needs for grain for fiscal at current market prices  feed grain costs would be approximately million lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal results of operations during fiscal net sales were  million as compared to  million during fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase in net sales resulted from an increase in the company s average sales price of poultry products sold of and an increase in the pounds of poultry products sold of 
the additional pounds of poultry products sold resulted from an increase in the number of chickens produced of and an increase in the average live weight of chickens produced of  partially offset by an increase in inventory of processed chicken 
the additional number of chickens processed was primarily the result of the additional production at the company s new waco processing division  which began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal and has increased production since that time 
the new waco plant is dedicated to the big bird deboning market and chickens processed at that plant have a higher average live weight than chickens processed at the company s chill pack processing locations  resulting in a higher average live weight of chickens produced in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the average sales price of the company s poultry products increased due to improvements during the first quarter of fiscal as compared 
table of contents to the first quarter of fiscal however  the improvement during the first quarter in market prices for poultry products was partially offset by lower overall market prices during the subsequent three quarters of fiscal as compared to the same periods during fiscal for fiscal as compared to fiscal  market prices for boneless breast  jumbo wings and tenders as reported by urner barry ub were  and lower  respectively 
a simple average of the georgia dock prices for whole chickens during fiscal as compared to fiscal increased 
although the average ub price for leg quarters was higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal  export prices for leg quarters and paws significantly declined during october as a result of the current world economic environment and credit disruptions 
net sales of prepared food products decreased million or 
pounds sold of the company s prepared chicken products decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the average sales price of prepared chicken products increased 
the company removed the entr e operations from its prepared chicken plant during the second quarter of fiscal to enable that facility to produce individually frozen poultry products and additional partially cooked chicken products 
cost of sales for fiscal was  million as compared to  million  an increase of million or as compared to fiscal cost of the company s poultry products increased million  or 
the increase in the company s cost of sales of poultry products resulted from the increase in the pounds of poultry products sold of  described above  and significantly higher cost of feed grains during fiscal as compared to fiscal a simple average of the company s cost of corn and soybean meal delivered during fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected increases of and  respectively 
cost of sales of the company s prepared chicken products decreased million or due to the lower market prices for poultry products  which is a major component of the company s prepared chicken products  and a decrease in the pounds of prepared chicken products sold of during fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal were million as compared to million during fiscal the decrease of million resulted from the contribution during fiscal of approximately million to the company s employee stock ownership plan esop and million expensed associated with the company s incentive award program iap 
both programs are contingent upon the company s profitability and  therefore  no expense was incurred during fiscal for the company s esop or iap 
in addition  during fiscal the company incurred million in start up costs related to the company s new waco  texas complex  which began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal all costs  except for certain customer service related costs  are classified to cost of sales after the new complex began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction above was partially offset by a planned increase in the company s advertising budget and certain other administrative costs 
the company recorded a charge of million to lower the value of live broiler inventories on hand at october   which resulted primarily from the significant decrease in expected market prices for export leg quarters and chicken paws and relatively low domestic prices for boneless breast meat during november and december of in favorable market conditions the company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost  and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date 
however  the company estimates that the cost to grow these birds to a marketable age and process and distribute these birds during november and december will be higher than the anticipated sales price during those months  resulting in a loss of million  before income taxes 
if the market prices return to a more favorable position during february and march of  the company s results for the first quarter of fiscal will improve as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal during september and october of market prices for products sold to some export markets declined significantly due to the current world economic environment 
the company s processed inventory at october  included approximately million pounds of leg quarter and paws awaiting shipment into the export markets 
these products were appropriately valued at october  at the lower of cost or market value  resulting in a charge before income taxes of million 

table of contents as described in note of the company s quarterly report on form q for its third fiscal quarter ended july   the company settled certain donning and doffing litigation during the third quarter of fiscal the settlement resulted in the recognition of a million expense before taxes during the third quarter ended july  and the fiscal year ended october  during august and september of the company incurred a charge of approximately million as a result of hurricane damage to processed poultry products in cold storage in new orleans  louisiana and additional expenses incurred due to temporary disruption of electricity service to the company s robertson county  texas feed mill 
a cold storage facility in new orleans was partially flooded during hurricane gustav and resulted in damage to some of the product held in that storage facility 
the feed mill was without electricity for approximately one week after hurricane ike during which time the company was able to maintain basic operations by renting generator capacity 
the feed mill returned to normal operations subsequent to electricity service being restored 
the company s insurance policy has a deductible of million for the hurricane season 
as the total cost of the hurricane season was less than the deductible  the company will not be reimbursed for these costs 
the company s operating loss for fiscal was million as compared to an operating income during fiscal of million 
the decrease of million is the result of historically high grain prices  lower market prices for boneless breast meat and a significant decrease in market prices for export products during october  november and december of the company s processed inventory on hand at october  included approximately million pounds of chicken leg quarters and paws which the company believes will be sold to export customers at prices below cost  resulting in a charge of approximately million to record that inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  because of the lower prices for export products  relatively low prices for boneless breast meat in the domestic market and decreasing but relatively high grain prices during november and december  the company recorded a net realizable loss of million to lower the value of the company s inventory of live broilers at october  the company s operating margin was also negatively impacted by the charge of million related to the settlement of the company s donning and doffing litigation and million as a result of the hurricane season  both described above 
interest expense during fiscal was million as compared to million during fiscal the increase in interest costs resulted primarily from higher outstanding debt and million in interest costs capitalized during fiscal to the cost of construction of the new complex in waco  texas 
the company did not capitalize any interest costs during fiscal the company s effective tax rate during fiscal and was and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate due to state income taxes  certain nondeductible expenses for federal income tax purposes and the benefit of certain federal income tax credits available as a result of the impact of hurricane katrina on the company and state investment credits unrelated to the hurricane 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal is higher than the company s anticipated effective tax rate at the end of the third quarter of fiscal primarily as a result of the economic stimulus package passed by congress on october  the economic stimulus legislation extended the katrina wotc credit from august  until august  the company reported a net loss of million or per share for fiscal as compared to a net income of million or per share for fiscal the company s net loss for fiscal includes charges of million  net of income taxes  or per share related to a mark down of live and processed inventories  settlement of the company s donning and doffing litigation and hurricane damaged inventories and additional hurricane related expenses 
executive overview of results the company s financial results for fiscal reflected significant improvement in market prices for the company s poultry products when compared to fiscal  in part due to sluggish demand for poultry products 
table of contents during fiscal resulting from the appearance of hn strain of avian flu in certain countries of asia and europe 
the improvement in financial performance during fiscal over fiscal was also the result of improved efficiencies at the company s poultry complexes in south georgia and collins  mississippi and the negative impact during the first quarter of fiscal on the company s mississippi and louisiana poultry operations due to the effects of hurricane katrina 
the south georgia complex reported a significant planned increase in the volume of poultry products sold during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the start up of operations during fiscal the collins  mississippi processing facility also increased the pounds of poultry products sold as a result of the conversion of the plant in the first quarter of fiscal to the big bird deboning market from the chill pack market 
that facility was down for one week during the first quarter of fiscal to allow for the installation of certain equipment required for the conversion of the facility to the big bird deboning market 
the effect of the improvements in market prices for the company s poultry products and increased efficiencies were partially offset by an increase in the cost of feed grains during as compared to fiscal market prices for corn were higher in fiscal in part because of increased demand from ethanol producers  and for soybean meal  which remained under pressure as a result of farmers switching acres from soybeans to corn 
results of operations net sales during fiscal were  million as compared to  million during fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase in net sales during fiscal reflected a increase in the pounds of poultry products sold and a increase in the pounds of prepared food products sold

the company did not make a contribution to the esop nor did the company have any expense associated with the incentive award program during fiscal the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses above were partially offset by a planned reduction in advertising during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s operating profit for fiscal was million  which was a significant improvement over the operating loss of million the company reported for fiscal during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the company s margins improved primarily from favorable market prices for the company s poultry products and increased efficiencies at the company s poultry facilities in south georgia and collins  mississippi  and the negative impact during fiscal of approximately million from hurricane katrina on the company s mississippi and louisiana facilities 
these improvements were partially offset by substantial increases in the costs of feed ingredients during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense during fiscal was million as compared to million during fiscal the company capitalized million and million  respectively during fiscal and fiscal primarily towards the cost of construction of the new complex in waco  texas

the company regularly evaluates both internal and external growth opportunities  including acquisition opportunities and the possible construction of new production assets  and conducts due diligence activities in connection with such opportunities 
the cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any growth opportunity  including the company s ability to raise debt or equity capital on terms and at costs satisfactory to the company  and the effect of such opportunities on the company s balance sheet  are critical considerations in any such evaluation 
contractual obligations obligations under long term debt  long term capital leases  non cancelable operating leases  purchase obligations relating to feed grains  other feed ingredients and packaging supplies and claims payable relating to the company s workers compensation insurance policy at october  were as follows in thousands payments due by period more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations feed grains  feed ingredients and packaging supplies construction contracts claims payable total critical accounting policies and estimates 
table of contents the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  and the differences could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 
inventories processed and prepared inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
when market prices for poultry are low and feed grains are high  the company may be required to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s costs of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in costs of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the costs of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
inventories at october   included approximately million pounds of leg quarters and paws awaiting shipment into the export markets 
the market prices for dark meat and paws declined below their costs during september and october  resulting in an approximately l million adjustment  before income taxes  to processed inventory values 
in addition  the company made an adjustment to the value of its live inventories 
as with processed inventories  the value of live chickens  the costs for which are accumulated during the life of a flock as each flock is fed and cared for  must be at the lower of cost or market 
because market prices have declined  the projected cost to complete  process and sell broilers included in live inventory at year end is expected to exceed the market value for the finished product 
the company s fourth quarter and year end results include a charge of million before income taxes to reduce the value of live inventories from cost to market 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to 
table of contents years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 
income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
contingencies the company is involved in various claims and litigation incidental to its business 
although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty  management  upon the advice of counsel  is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operation or financial position 
the company is a party to a number of legal proceedings and recognizes the costs of legal defense in the periods incurred 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these matters is made after considerable analysis of each individual case 
because the outcome of these cases cannot be determined with any certainty  no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss resulting from the cases can be made 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
future reserves may be required if losses are deemed probable due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of or changes to reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations of these legal proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company purchases feed ingredients for deferred delivery from one month to six months after the time of purchase 
the company sometimes purchases its feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the regular business of supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 
such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders
