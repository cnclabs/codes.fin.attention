item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward looking statements we make in this annual report 
you should review carefully the risk factors listed below  as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the sec 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
unless required by applicable law  we do not assume an obligation to update any forward looking statement 
our business is highly cyclical in nature 
the pulp business is cyclical in nature and markets for our principal products are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance  which in turn affects product prices 
pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates  all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our earnings 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro economic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
industry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production or permanently close machines or entire mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends 
demand for pulp has historically been determined by the level of economic growth and has been closely tied to overall business activity 
although pulp prices have improved over the last two years  we cannot predict the impact of future economic weakness in certain world markets or the impact of war  terrorist activity or other events on our markets 
prices for pulp are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond our control determine the price for pulp  such price may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities 
therefore  our profitability depends on managing our cost structure  particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control 
if the prices of our products decline  or if raw materials increase  or both  demand for our products may decline and our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
fiber costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber which is highly cyclical in nature and can vary significantly by location 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
lower operating rates and production efficiencies during periods of cyclically low demand result in higher average production costs and lower margins 
cyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials could adversely affect our business 
wood chips and pulp logs comprise the fiber used by our pulp mills 
such fiber is cyclical in terms of both price and supply 
the cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber 
demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products produced globally and regionally 
recently  continued high energy prices  a focus on green or renewable energy and governmental initiatives have led to an increase in renewable energy projects in europe  including germany 
demand for wood residuals from such energy producers has put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals such as wood chips in germany and its neighboring countries 
this has resulted in higher fiber costs for our german pulp mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices 
similarly  north american energy producers are exploring the viability of renewable energy initiatives which could increase the demand for sawmill residual fiber  including chips 
the cyclical nature of pricing for these raw materials represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers 
we do not own any timberlands or have any long term governmental timber concessions nor do we have any long term fiber contracts at our german operations 
raw materials are available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases  however our requirements have increased and may continue to increase as we increase capacity through capital projects or other efficiency measures at our mills 
as a result  we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply 
in addition  the quality of fiber we receive could be reduced as a result of industrial disputes  material curtailments or shut down of operations by suppliers  government orders and legislation  weather conditions  acts of god and other events beyond our control 
an insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition to the supply of wood fiber  we are dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities 
any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million is project debt of stendal 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our high debt levels may have important consequences for us  including  but not limited to the following our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations or meet our working capital needs or any such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all  a certain amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements  which could force us to modify our operations  and our leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
our performance  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions  as well as financial  business  legislative  regulatory  industry and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations  in particular the stendal project debt  may depend in significant part on the success of the stendal mill and the extent to which we can implement successfully our business and growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
we sell our pulp globally  with a large percentage sold in europe  north america and asia 
the markets for pulp are highly competitive 
a number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position 
for pulp  many companies produce products that are largely standardized 
as a result  the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price 
many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future 
the global pulp market has historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings 
prices are typically denominated in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
in  the majority of our sales were in products quoted in us dollars while most of our operating costs and expenses  other than those of the celgar mill  were incurred in euros 
in addition  all of the products sold by the celgar mill are quoted in us dollars and the celgar mill costs are primarily incurred in canadian dollars 
our results of operations and financial condition are reported in euros 
as a result  our revenues have been adversely affected by the decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and to the canadian dollar 
such shifts in currencies relative to the euro and the canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  stendal entered into variable to fixed interest rate swaps to fix interest payments under the stendal mill financing facility  which has kept stendal from benefiting from the general decline in interest rates that ensued 
these derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings for the relevant reporting periods 
increases in our capital expenditures or maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
our business is capital intensive 
our annual capital expenditures may vary due to fluctuations in requirements for maintenance  business capital  expansion and as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures to bring our operations into compliance with such regulations 
in addition  our senior management and board of directors may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures 
increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
further  while we regularly perform maintenance on our manufacturing equipment  key pieces of equipment in our various production processes may still need to be repaired or replaced 
if we do not have sufficient funds or such repairs or replacements are delayed  the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we use derivatives to manage certain risk which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant amount of our sales revenue is based on pulp sales quoted in us dollars while our reporting currency is euros and our costs are predominantly in euros and in canadian dollars 
from time to time  we use foreign currency derivative instruments primarily to try to manage against depreciation of the us dollar against the euro 
we also use derivative instruments to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
concurrently with entering into the stendal financing  stendal entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps for the full term of the stendal facility to manage its interest rate risk exposure with respect to the full principal amount of this facility 
we record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
these unrealized and realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period 
for example  our operating results for included realized and unrealized net gains of million on our currency and interest rate derivatives 
our operating results for included realized and unrealized net gains of million on currency and interest rate derivatives 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur losses which may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  we may in the future use derivative instruments to manage pulp price risks 
the purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature  we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre set percentage of revenues or other formula  but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could have environmental liabilities at our facilities 
our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws as well as permits  guidelines and policies 
these laws  permits  guidelines and policies govern  among other things unlawful discharges to land  air  water and sewers  waste collection  storage  transportation and disposal  hazardous waste  dangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection  storage  transportation and disposal of such substances  the clean up of unlawful discharges  land use planning  municipal zoning  and employee health and safety 
in addition  as a result of our operations  we may be subject to remediation  clean up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits  and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries 
future orders  proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing 
new regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive  at times requiring the replacement  enhancement or modification of equipment  facilities or operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements 
we are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate  including damage to neighboring landowners  residents or employees  particularly as a result of the contamination of soil  groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water 
the costs of such liabilities can be substantial 
our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities 
we may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport  treat or dispose of at other locations 
in addition  we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired 
except for stendal  our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent environmental contamination exists 
as a result  these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent  including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners 
because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability  any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant capital expenditures 
we may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
we are subject to risks related to our employees 
the majority of our employees are unionized 
in the future we may enter into a collective agreement with our pulp workers at the stendal mill 
the collective agreements relating to hourly workers at both our rosenthal and celgar mills expire in although we have not experienced any work stoppages in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements or in conjunction with the establishment of a new agreement or arrangement with our pulp workers at the stendal mill 
this could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers 
the registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
accordingly  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher on going labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we rely on german federal and state government grants and guarantees 
we currently benefit from a subsidized capital expenditure program and lower cost of financing as a result of german federal and state government grants and guarantees at our stendal mill 
should either the german federal or state governments be prohibited from honoring legislative grants and guarantees at stendal  or should we be required to repay any such legislative grants  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the sale of emission allowances is relatively new and volatile and subject to governmental amendment 
commencing in  our german operations became subject to the european emissions trading scheme 
over the last three years  we have benefited from the sales of emission allowances 
the market for emission allowances is relatively new and volatile 
further  the allocation of emission allowances  which is currently based upon production volumes and the types of fuels consumed by manufacturing facilities in germany  is subject to governmental review and potential changes in additionally  we expect that  over time  the amount of emission allowances granted to manufacturing facilities in germany will be reduced although we cannot predict the timing or the amount of any such reduction 
as a result  we cannot predict with any certainty either the amount of future sales of emission allowances or the amount of emission allowances we may be granted 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future success depends  to a large extent  on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers 
such officers are industry professionals many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles 
our officers play an integral role in  among other things sales and marketing  reducing operating costs  identifying capital projects which provide a high rate of return  and prioritizing expenditures and maintaining employee relations 
the loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive in these areas which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers 
we may experience material disruptions to our production 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales and or negatively impact our results of operations 
any of our pulp manufacturing facilities could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  design error or operator error  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railway tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  earthquakes or other natural catastrophes  labor difficulties  and other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
we have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our pulp mills 
our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions 
damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by  or exceed the limits of  our insurance coverage 
we rely on third parties for transportation services 
our business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp to our customers  as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills 
our pulp and raw materials are principally transported by truck  barge  rail and sea going vessels  all of which are highly regulated 
increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp in a timely manner  it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to sell it at full value 
if our transportation providers fail to deliver our raw materials in a timely fashion  we may be unable to manufacture pulp in response to customer orders 
also  if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations  we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
washington state law and our articles of incorporation may have anti takeover effects which will make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we are subject to the provisions of the revised code of washington  chapter b  which prohibits a washington corporation  including our company  from engaging in any business combination with an acquiring person for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an acquiring person  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes mergers  asset sales as well as certain transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the acquiring person 
subject to certain exceptions  an acquiring person is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or within five years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
we may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
under washington state law  we have the ability to adopt certain of these measures  including  without limitation  a shareholder rights plan  without any further vote or action by the holders of our shares 
these measures may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our shares might consider in its best interest

we own the rosenthal and celgar mills and the underlying property 
the stendal mill is situated on property owned by stendal  our owned subsidiary 
the rosenthal mill is situated on a acre site near the town of blankenstein in the state of th ringia  approximately kilometers south of the stendal mill 
the saale river flows through the site of the mill 
in late  we completed a major capital project which converted the rosenthal mill to the production of kraft pulp 
it is a single line mill with a current annual production capacity of approximately  admts of kraft pulp 
the mill is self sufficient in steam and electrical power 
some excess electrical power which is constantly generated is sold to the regional power grid 
the facilities at the mill include an approximately  square feet fiber storage area  barking and chipping facilities for pulp logs  an approximately  square feet roundwood yard  a fiber line  which includes a kamyr continuous digester and bleaching facilities  a pulp machine  which includes a dryer  a cutter and a bailing line  an approximately  square feet finished goods storage area  a chemical recovery system  which includes a recovery boiler  evaporation plant and recausticizing plant  a fresh water plant  a wastewater treatment plant  and a power station with a turbine capable of producing megawatts of electric power from steam produced by the recovery boiler 
the stendal mill is situated on a acre site owned by stendal that is part of a larger  acre industrial park near the town of stendal in the state of saxony anhalt  approximately kilometers north of the rosenthal mill and kilometers from the city of berlin 
the mill is adjacent to the elbe river and has access to harbor facilities for water transportation 
the mill is a single line mill with a current annual design production capacity of approximately  admts of kraft pulp 
the stendal mill is self sufficient in steam and electrical power 
some excess electrical power which is constantly being generated is sold to the regional power grid 
the facilities at the mill include an approximately  square feet fiber storage area  barking and chipping facilities for pulp logs  a fiber line  which includes ten superbatch digester and bleaching facilities  a pulp machine  which includes a dryer  a cutter and a bailing line  an approximately  square feet finished goods storage area  a recovery line  which includes a recovery boiler  evaporation plant  recausticizing plant and lime kiln  a fresh water plant  a wastewater treatment plant  and a power station with a turbine capable of producing approximately megawatts of electric power from steam produced by the recovery boiler and a power boiler 
the celgar mill is situated on a acre site near the city of castlegar  british columbia 
the mill is located on the south bank of the columbia river  approximately kilometers east of the port city of vancouver  british columbia  and approximately kilometers north of the canada us border 
the city of seattle  washington is approximately kilometers southwest of castlegar 
it is a single line mill with a current annual production capacity of approximately  admts of nbsk pulp 
internal power generating capacity could  with certain capital improvements  enable the celgar mill to be self sufficient in electrical power and at times to sell surplus electricity 
the facilities at the celgar mill include chip storage facilities consisting of four vertical silos and an asphalt surfaced yard with a capacity of  cubic meters of chips  a woodroom containing debarking and chipping equipment for pulp logs  a fiber line  which includes a dual vessel hydraulic digester  pressure knotting and screening  single stage oxygen delignification and a four stage bleach plant  two pulp machines  which each include a dryer  a cutter and a bailing line  a chemical recovery system  which includes a recovery boiler  evaporation plant  recausticizing area and effluent treatment system  and a turbine and generator capable of producing approximately megawatts of electric power from steam produced by a recovery boiler and power boiler fueled by natural gas 
at the end of  substantially all of the assets relating to the stendal mill were pledged to secure the stendal loan facility 
the working capital loan facilities established for the rosenthal and celgar mills are secured by first charges against the inventories and receivables at the respective mills 
the following table sets out our pulp production capacity and actual production sales volumes and revenues by mill for the periods indicated annual production years ended december  capacity admts pulp production by mill rosenthal celgar stendal total pulp production as we acquired the celgar mill in february  the actual production for includes production from the celgar mill from the time of its acquisition

targeted production is generally based upon days per year 
item legal proceedings in october  our wholly owned subsidiary  zellstoff celgar limited  received a re assessment for real property transfer tax payable in british columbia  canada  in the amount of approximately million c million in connection with the transfer of the land where the celgar mill is situated 
we are contesting the assessment and the amount  if any  that may be payable in connection therewith is not yet determinable 
as our stendal mill is located in eastern germany  it received approximately million of government grants  which are applied to reduce the cost basis of the assets acquired with such grants 
under european union rules  the commission of the european communities  referred to as the commission  was formally notified in march by germany of plans to provide support to the stendal mill through grants and guarantees 
the commission considered these plans and  on june   decided not to raise any objection against such support being provided by the german federal and state governments in respect of the stendal mill 
in its decision  the commission was not called upon to determine whether the governmental aid schemes  on which the support is based  were acceptable  but was limited to a determination as to whether a reduction of the pre approved aid level for investment in the german state of saxony anhalt under the previously approved schemes was required under european union law in the case of the stendal mill 
in coming to its decision  the commission generally has a wide margin of discretion in its assessment of facts and data 
under european union law  member states  competitors or trade associations directly affected by a decision of the commission may appeal such decision within a period of two months and days after publication of the commission decision 
on december   kronoply gmbh and kronotex gmbh co  two related manufacturers of  among other things  oriented strand board  or osb  and medium density fiber boards  or mdf  boards that do not compete with the stendal mill by selling pulp or paper  filed an appeal with the court of first instance of the european communities luxembourg  referred to as the court  against the commission decision of june  generally  to be successful  an appeal must show that the commission failed to comply with procedural requirements or committed a manifest error in assessing facts and data in adopting its decision 
in late  the court in an unrelated case determined that the commission committed a procedural error in determining the amount of state aid that could be granted by germany to a recipient in a different business 
the court found the commission erred when reviewing the effect of state aid on competition by only considering capacity utilization and not also considering product demand trends prior to providing its approval 
as a result  in that case the court set aside the commission approval and remanded the matter back to the commission to redetermine 
the court s decision is being appealed by the aid recipient and the government of germany 
if such appeal is unsuccessful  the commission will have to redetermine the matter in such unrelated case based upon its mandated criteria and may come to the same determination as before 
the procedure followed by the commission in this remanded decision was similar to that it used in determining not to reduce the amount of state aid available to the stendal mill 
although no assurance can be provided  we continue to believe that the appellant does not have any standing to bring the appeal as it is not a competitor of stendal and  in any event  that the appeal is without merit 
further  the procedural error found by the court in the remanded case was not raised in the stendal appeal and we do not believe the court should permit the appellant to amend its appeal at this stage 
subject to the court s schedule  we believe a hearing  in which the court would consider both the standing of the applicant and the merits of the appeal is likely to occur in the course of in the event the appellant was then successful both on the issue of standing and as regards the merits and such decision was upheld on appeal  the issue of whether the amount of state aid granted to the stendal mill should be reduced would be remanded back to the commission for reconsideration 
although we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such redetermination  we believe that  given the commission s criteria and the factual circumstances related to the stendal mill including demand trends in the pulp business  there would be no basis for the commission to reduce the level of state aid 
if the commission determined to reduce the level of state aid available to the stendal mill and such decision was upheld on appeal  stendal would be required to repay a portion of the previously received state aid back to the german government 
while we do not expect an adverse outcome  litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance of the final outcome 
we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the outcome of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

previously reported financial statements for all periods and certain amounts in our financial statements and related notes included herein have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation  and only our continuing operations except as otherwise expressly noted 
results of operations we operate in the pulp business and our operations are located in germany and western canada 
our pulp mills are comprised of a an nbsk pulp mill operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  rosenthal  near blankenstein  germany  which has a current annual production capacity of approximately  admts  b a state of the art nbsk pulp mill  with a current production capacity of approximately  admts per year  near stendal  germany owned and operated by our owned subsidiary  stendal  and c the celgar nbsk pulp mill operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  celgar  with a current annual production capacity of approximately  admts located near castlegar  british columbia  canada 
our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs 
sales and production results are influenced largely by the market price for products and raw materials  the mix of products produced and foreign currency exchange rates 
kraft pulp markets are highly cyclical  with prices determined by supply and demand 
demand for kraft pulp is influenced to a significant degree by global levels of economic activity and supply is driven by industry capacity and utilization rates 
our product mix is important because premium grades of nbsk pulp generally achieve higher prices and profit margins 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
wood chip and pulp log costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber and pulp  which are both highly cyclical 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
high operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average cost by spreading fixed costs over more units 
global economic conditions  changes in production capacity and inventory levels are the primary factors affecting kraft pulp prices 
historically  kraft pulp prices have been cyclical in nature 
the average european list prices for nbsk pulp between and ranged from a low of per admt in to a high of per admt in list prices for nbsk pulp weakened in primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar and were approximately per admt in europe in december pulp prices increased steadily in primarily as a result of the closure of several pulp mills  particularly in north america  which reduced nbsk pulp capacity by approximately million admts  better demand and the general weakness of the us dollar 
at the end of  list prices for nbsk pulp in europe had increased to approximately per admt 
a producer s sales realizations will reflect customer discounts  commissions and other items and nbsk pulp prices will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our financial performance for any reporting period is also impacted by changes in the us dollar to euro and canadian dollar exchange rate and in interest rates 
changes in currency rates affect our operating results because the price for our principal product  nbsk pulp  is generally based on a global industry benchmark that is quoted in us dollars  even though a significant portion of the sales from our german mills is invoiced in euros 
therefore  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar will generally reduce the amount of revenues of our pulp operations 
most of our operating costs at our german mills  including our debt obligations under the stendal loan facility and rosenthal loan facility  are incurred in euros 
most of our operating costs at the celgar mill  including under its working capital facility  are in canadian dollars 
these costs do not fluctuate with the us dollar to euro or canadian dollar exchange rates 
thus  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar tends to reduce our sales revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
from time to time  we seek to mitigate the effect of such weakening against the euro through foreign currency derivatives we put into place from time to time to protect against such currency movements 
changes in interest rates can impact our operating results because the credit facilities established for our pulp mills provide for floating rates of interest 
changes in currency exchange and interest rates also impact certain foreign currency and interest rate derivatives used by stendal and rosenthal from time to time to partially protect against the effect of such changes 
gains or losses on such derivatives are included in our earnings  either as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in  stendal entered into currency swaps in the aggregate principal amount of million to convert all of its long term indebtedness under the stendal loan facility from euros into us dollars  as well as certain currency forwards  such swaps and forwards being collectively referred to as the currency derivatives 
in  we recorded a net realized gain of million before minority interests on the settlement of such swaps and a net unrealized non cash loss of million before minority interests on the balance of the currency derivatives 
in  we recorded a net realized loss of million before minority interests on the settlement of such swaps and a net unrealized non cash gain of million before minority interests on the currency derivatives 
in  we recorded a net realized loss of million before minority interests on the currency derivatives that were settled and a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests in respect of the currency derivatives 
stendal  as required under its project financing  entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps  referred to as the stendal interest rate contracts  in august to fix the interest rate on approximately million of indebtedness for the full term of the stendal loan facility 
in and  we recorded net unrealized non cash holding gains of million and million  respectively  before minority interests on the marked to market valuation of the stendal interest rate contracts 
these gains resulted primarily from improving world economies and increases in long term european interest rates 
in  we recorded a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests on the stendal interest rate contracts 
slowing world economies and a fall in interest rates could result in our recording non cash holding losses on the stendal interest rate contracts in future periods when they are marked to market

weak markets for emission allowances in resulted in the contribution to income from such sales decreasing to million  compared to million in partially offsetting this was a increase in sales of surplus energy in compared to overall  in  fiber costs increased by approximately compared to as a result of both a supply imbalance and increased demand 
in germany  the supply imbalance resulted from low harvesting levels in late and which were not made up during the course of the year 
increased demand in germany resulted from higher consumption of wood residuals by renewable energy suppliers 
a strong european lumber market at the beginning of provided some marginal price relief in the middle of the year 
fiber costs at our celgar mill were also higher in the current period compared to the comparative period of due to reduced north american sawmill activity as a result of weakness in us housing construction 
fiber costs at our celgar mill were relatively stable over the last half of  due to supply optimization and the currency impact on the mill s us sourced fiber 
overall  continued weakness in lumber markets may put upward pressure on prices in the first half of operating depreciation and amortization increased marginally to million in from million in for the year ended december   operating income decreased to million from million in the prior year as higher pulp prices  productivity and energy sales were more than offset by higher fiber costs  the weakening of the us dollar and the reduction in sales of emission allowances 
interest expense in decreased by to million from million in primarily due to a lower level of borrowing by stendal as it repaid million in principal  the settlement of the cross currency swaps in the first quarter of and the inclusion in of million of interest expense related to our repurchase of convertible notes 
stendal previously entered into the stendal interest rate contracts to fix the interest rate on its outstanding bank indebtedness and we also entered into the currency derivatives 
due primarily to the increase in long term european interest rates  we recorded an unrealized gain of million before minority interests on our outstanding derivatives in  compared to an unrealized net gain of million before minority interests on our outstanding derivatives in which included a realized loss of million from the settlement of currency forwards 
a portion of our long term debt is denominated and repayable in foreign currencies  principally us dollars 
in  we recorded an unrealized gain of million on our foreign currency denominated debt as a result of the weakening of the us dollar during the period  compared to an unrealized gain of million thereon in in we decreased our provision for deferred income tax by approximately million  primarily due to lower unrealized gains on our derivative instruments 
in  minority interest  representing the minority shareholder s proportionate interest in the stendal mill  was million  compared to million in we reported net income for of million  or per basic and per diluted share  which included an aggregate net gain of million on our outstanding derivatives and a foreign exchange gain on our long term debt

operating ebitda is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges of million and million to the operating income from continuing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results  and as a benchmark relative to its competitors 
management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost  and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities 
in addition  we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance 
operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income loss  including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from operations as a measure of performance  nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are that operating ebitda does not reflect i our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ii changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  iii the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our outstanding debt  iv minority interests on our stendal nbsk pulp mill operations  v the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions  which can be substantial  and vi operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of impairment charges against our investments or assets 
because of these limitations  operating ebitda should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
see the statement of cash flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein 
because all companies do not calculate operating ebitda in the same manner  operating ebitda as calculated by us may differ from operating ebitda or ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by using operating ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and relying primarily on our gaap financial statements

we recorded a contribution to income from the sale of emission allowances of million and million in and  respectively 
on average  our fiber costs for our german mills increased by approximately compared to as a result of both a supply imbalance and increased demand 
the supply imbalance resulted primarily from low harvest levels during the severe winter conditions in late and early in central europe 
such low harvest levels were not made up over the course of the year 
the increase in demand resulted from demand for wood residuals from alternative or renewable energy producers 
these factors contributed to upward pressure on fiber prices in the latter half of and for fiber deliveries into the start of severe winter storms in central europe in january reportedly caused the downfall of over million cubic meters of wood 
this wood will need to be harvested and processed in a timely manner and we expect this to increase the fiber supply to our german mills and to temper and moderate fiber prices in the second half of in  fiber costs for our celgar mill increased by approximately over the prior year  primarily because of fluctuations in regional wood chip availability caused by slumping north american lumber markets 
operating depreciation and amortization for the pulp operations increased to million in the current period  from million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of depreciation at our celgar mill

nbsk pulp is a global commodity that is priced in us dollars  whose markets are highly competitive and cyclical in nature 
as a result  our earnings are sensitive to nbsk pulp price changes 
based upon our sales volume and assuming all other factors remained constant  each per tonne change in nbsk pulp prices yields a change in operating ebitda of approximately million 
foreign exchange 
as nbsk pulp is principally quoted in us dollars  the amount of revenues we generate fluctuates with changes in the value of the us dollar to the euro 
based upon our revenues  each change in the value of the us dollar yields a change in annual gross sales revenue of approximately million

for further information regarding the restricted group including  without limitation  a reconciliation to our consolidated results of operations  see note of our annual financial statements included herein 
restricted group results year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the restricted group in increased to million from million in  primarily because of higher prices and sales volumes 
average pulp sales realizations for the restricted group increased to per admt on average in the year ended december  from per admt in the increase in pulp prices was partially offset by the weakening of the us dollar which decreased in value by approximately and against the euro and the canadian dollar  respectively  during the period 
operating costs and selling  general  administrative and other expenses for the restricted group in increased to million from million in the comparative period of  primarily as a result of increased fiber costs and higher sales volume 
operating depreciation and amortization for the restricted group in increased marginally to million from million in during  we took an aggregate of days scheduled annual maintenance downtime at our rosenthal and celgar mills 
during  our rosenthal and celgar mills took approximately days of scheduled maintenance and strategic capital expenditure downtime  during which rosenthal completed the installation of a new brownstock washer 
during the scheduled maintenance downtime at celgar  we implemented the final phase of our blue goose capital project consisting of the dryer capacity expansion 
these changes have shown improvements in production capacity and operational efficiencies  as evidenced by celgar achieving daily  monthly and quarterly production records during the year 
the markets and prices for emission allowances continue to be weak  and as a result our contribution to income from the sale of such emission allowances by our rosenthal pulp mill in was million  compared to million in overall  fiber costs of the restricted group increased by approximately in versus the same period of as a result of both a supply imbalance and increased demand 
in germany  the supply imbalance resulted from low harvesting levels in late and which were not made up during the course of the year 
increased demand in germany resulted from higher consumption of wood residuals by renewable energy suppliers 
a strong european lumber market at the beginning of provided some price relief in the middle of the year 
overall  we currently expect fiber prices to be generally level for the balance of the year but continued weakness in lumber markets may put upward pressure on prices in early in  income from operations of the restricted group increased to million from million last year  primarily as a result of higher pulp prices  partially offset by higher fiber prices and a weakening us dollar

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and the timing of recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying note disclosures 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report 
while all of the significant accounting policies are important to the consolidated financial statements  some of these policies may be viewed as having a high degree of judgment 
on an ongoing basis using currently available information  management reviews its estimates  including those related to accounting for pensions and post retirement benefits  provisions for bad debt and doubtful accounts  derivative instruments  impairment of long lived assets  deferred taxes and environmental conservation and legal liabilities 
actual estimates could differ from these estimates 
the following accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty 
derivative instruments 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective january  derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
accounting for gains or losses depends on the intended use of the derivative instruments 
gains or losses on derivative instruments which are not designated hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings in the period of the change in fair value 
gains or losses on derivative instruments formally designated as hedges are recognized in either earnings or other comprehensive income 
in  we reported a net unrealized non cash holding gain of million before minority interests in respect of the stendal interest rate contracts 
we also recognized a net gain of million in respect of the currency derivatives 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management to make subjective judgments 
in addition  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
our management considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  actual impairment losses could vary materially  either positively or negatively  from estimated impairment losses 
no impairment losses were recorded in deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  both of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
the amounts recorded for deferred tax are based upon various judgments  assumptions and estimates 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized  based on currently available information  including  but not limited to  the following the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates  future reversals of temporary differences  our projected earnings  and tax planning opportunities 
if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of these deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on currently available information  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets 
as at december   we had million in deferred tax assets and million in deferred tax liabilities  resulting in a net deferred tax liability of million 
our tax assets are net of a million valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   our review concluded that it was appropriate to reduce the valuation allowance against loss carryforwards by approximately million primarily as a result of a legislated tax rate reduction in germany after considering expected future earnings 
if market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax benefits 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future  we will increase our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax expenses 
any change in tax laws  particularly in germany  will change the valuation allowances in future periods 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  or fas 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for entities that have equity investments that are not attributable directly to the parent  called noncontrolling interests or minority interests 
specifically  fas states where and how to report noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial position and operations  how to account for changes in noncontrolling interests and provides disclosure requirements 
the provisions of fas are effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations  or fas r 
fas r establishes how an entity accounts for the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests acquired  how to account for goodwill acquired and determines what disclosures are required as part of a business combination 
fas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it is applicable whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but it does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  on february   the fasb staff issued for comment fasb staff position fas  or fsp  which defers the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
fsp defers the effective date of fas to fiscal years beginning after november  for items within the scope of fsp we are in the process of determining the impact  if any  the adoption of fas will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the objective of improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions of fas are effective for our year ending december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
for additional discussion of new accounting standards see note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements in this annual report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended 
these statements use forward looking terminology  are based on present information we have related to our existing business circumstances and various assumptions we make and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
we caution you that  unless required by applicable law  we do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or income during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and  since  the canadian dollar versus the us dollar and the euro 
changes in these rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition and  consequently  our fair value 
we seek to manage these risks through internal risk management policies as well as the use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and currency risks 
we may in the future use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp prices 
we also use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains  depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments 
these types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature 
they are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts 
many of our strategies  including the use of derivatives  and the types of derivatives selected by us  are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events 
however  these strategies may not be effective in all market environments or against all types of risks 
unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time  and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur significant losses 
derivatives derivatives are contracts between two parties where payments between the parties are dependent upon movements in the price of an underlying asset  index or financial rate 
examples of derivatives include swaps  options and forward rate agreements 
the notional amount of the derivatives is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties and the notional amount itself is not generally exchanged by the parties 
the principal derivatives we use are foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate derivatives 
foreign exchange derivatives include currency swaps which involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency 
such cross currency swaps involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies 
they also include foreign exchange forwards which are contractual obligations in which two counterparties agree to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a pre determined future date 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the over the counter market 
interest rate derivatives include interest rate forwards forward rate agreements which are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest rate sensitive financial instrument on a future date at a specified price 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between different counterparties in the over the counter market 
they also include interest rate swaps which are over the counter contracts in which two counterparties exchange interest payments based upon rates applied to a notional amount 
we use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs including currency swaps relating to our long term indebtedness from euros to us dollars as our principal product is priced in us dollars 
we have also converted some of our costs to us dollars by issuing long term us dollar denominated debt in the form of our convertible subordinated notes and million senior notes issued in february the proceeds of the senior notes were used in part to repay a project loan facility for our rosenthal mill  referred to as the project facility 
we use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness  including under the stendal loan facility and  prior to its repayment in february  the project facility 
all of the derivatives we entered into were either pursuant to the project facility  which was repaid and discharged in february  or the stendal loan facility 
each of these loan facilities provided facilities for foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives and commodities derivatives  subject to prescribed controls  including maximum notional and at risk amounts 
the stendal loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the stendal mill and has the benefit of certain german governmental guarantees 
prior to its discharge in  the project facility was secured by substantially all of the mill s assets and also had the benefit of certain german governmental grants 
neither of these credit facilities had any separate margin requirements when derivatives are entered into pursuant to their terms and are subsequently marked to market 
the revolving working capital credit facility we established in february for the rosenthal mill allows us to enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to its operations 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our outstanding derivatives when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
we determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties 
in march  rosenthal entered into currency derivatives which included two currency swaps in the aggregate principal amount of million that mature in september and september  respectively 
as nbsk pulp prices are quoted in us dollars and the majority of our business transactions are denominated in euros  rosenthal had entered into the currency swaps to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts outstanding under its project loan facility 
under these currency swaps  rosenthal effectively paid the principal and interest in us dollars and at us dollar borrowing rates 
the rosenthal currency derivatives also included a currency forward in the notional amount of million which matured in march that was entered into to reduce or limit rosenthal s exposure to currency risks 
in august  stendal entered into the stendal interest rate contracts in connection with its long term indebtedness relating to the stendal mill to fix the interest rate under the stendal loan facility at the then low level  relative to its historical trend and projected variable interest rate 
these contracts were entered into under a specific credit line under the stendal loan facility and are subject to prescribed controls  including certain maximum amounts for notional and at risk amounts 
under the stendal interest rate contracts  stendal pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments being calculated on a notional amount 
the interest rates payable under the stendal loan facility were swapped into fixed rates based on the eur euribor rate for the repayment periods of the tranches under the stendal loan facility 
stendal effectively converted the stendal loan facility from a variable interest rate loan into a fixed interest rate loan  thereby reducing interest rate uncertainty 
in march  stendal also entered into currency derivatives which are comprised of a currency swap in the principal amount of million which matures in april and a currency forward contract for the notional amount of million maturing in march to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks and to augment its potential gains or reduce its potential losses 
in december  we settled all of our then outstanding currency derivatives due to the substantial weakening of the us dollar versus the euro in and realized a gain of million thereon 
in february  we settled the rosenthal interest rate contracts in connection with the repayment and discharge of the project facility and realized a loss of million thereon 
in the first quarter of  stendal entered into foreign currency derivatives in order to swap approximately three quarters of its long term indebtedness outstanding under the stendal loan facility into us dollars as follows i approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october  and ii approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october in the second quarter of  stendal swapped the balance of its long term indebtedness under the stendal loan facility  being approximately million in principal amount  into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october all of these currency swaps were entered into by stendal to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts under the stendal loan facility 
during the first quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of which matured in february and a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in september during the second quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of which also matured in september in the third quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in october these currency derivatives were entered into by stendal to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks 
we are exposed to very modest credit related risks in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative contracts 
however  we do not expect that the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  will fail to meet their obligations
