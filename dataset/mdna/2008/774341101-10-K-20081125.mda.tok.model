we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september for ease of presentation  september is utilized consistently throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to represent the fiscal year end date 
was a week fiscal year  while and were week fiscal years 
all date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year unless otherwise stated 
overview and outlook in we generated financial results that once again reflect the continuing strength and balance of our commercial systems and government systems businesses as we continued to improve enterprise wide operating performance  highlighted by an percent increase in total revenues to billion a percent increase in diluted earnings per share to a percent increase in net income to million these results were generated while our businesses invested a total of almost million  or percent of sales  in research and development r d programs for new product development that are expected to benefit our company over the next several years 
the increase in our net income significantly outpaced our increase in revenues and speaks to the ability of our management team to effectively manage costs and deploy resources to create shareowner value 
the strength of our management team and business is evidenced by four key aspects of our company our focus on r d efforts  our ability to grow in excess of our end markets  our unique shared service business model  and the focus from all of our employees on delivering to stakeholder expectations 
research and development efforts with r d focused on both key product introductions to be realized in the near term  as well as key technology opportunities to be realized in the distant future  we seek to bring a continuing stream of unique  customer focused solutions to the marketplace 
much of our company funded r d is related to new avionics and new cabin systems for aircraft introductions  the schedule for which is dependent upon the plans of our oem customers 
we are also focused on developing future technologies to solve our customers needs and provide continuing growth opportunities for our business 
sales growth in excess of our end markets through organic sales and acquisition related sales  we are focused on expanding our portfolio of products and systems that translates into profitable growth and delivers positive long term shareowner investment returns 
we have captured key market share wins in our addressed markets 
through our positions on existing platforms and platforms expected to be introduced  we believe we are well positioned to grow sales in excess of both the overall commercial aerospace and defense markets 
acquisitions continue to be an area where we look for strategically oriented opportunities to enhance our capabilities and contribute to our organic growth 
shared service business model through our shared service business model we have been able to deliver consistently improving financial results in varying market conditions 
with the organization of our shared service functions  specifically including manufacturing  engineering  human resources  information technology  and finance  we have great insight into our cost structure 
our shared service business model is one of the key factors we utilize to convert higher year over year revenues into even higher earnings growth 
deliver to stakeholder expectations we seek to differentiate ourselves by understanding and meeting the expectations of all our key stakeholders 
we seek to understand our customers needs and provide solutions that enable our customers to meet their commitments 
with employees and suppliers  we maintain open channels of communication and develop partnerships that are structured to be competitive and last through varying market conditions 
most importantly  with shareowners we believe our transparency provides investors with a clear picture of how we operate and how we view the factors that drive our markets so we can provide meaningful insight into our business 
we expect to continue delivering growth in our businesses as we head into  highlighted by the following projected results total revenues in the range of approximately billion to billion diluted earnings per share in the range of to cash flow from operations in the range of million to million r d expenditures in the range of million to million  or about percent of sales see the following operating segment sections for further discussion of and anticipated segment results

results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of results of operations is based on reported financial results for through and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item below 
consolidated financial results sales dollars in millions domestic international total percent increase total sales in increased percent to  million compared to incremental sales from the august acquisition of information technology applications corporation itac and the april acquisition of athena technologies athena contributed a total of million  or less than percentage point of the overall revenue growth 
the remainder of the sales increase resulted from percent organic revenue growth in our commercial systems business and percent organic revenue growth in our government systems business 
domestic sales growth continues to be driven by strong demand for commercial products and systems to original equipment manufacturers and airlines and continued demand from the us government for our government systems communication and electronic systems  products and services 
international sales were impacted by strong demand from commercial aerospace customers 
total sales in increased percent to  million compared to sales from acquired businesses  primarily evans sutherland computer corporation s military and commercial simulation business the e s simulation business  contributed million  or percentage points of the sales growth 
the remainder of the sales increase resulted from percent organic revenue growth in our commercial systems business and percent organic revenue growth in our government systems business 
domestic sales growth was driven by strong demand for commercial products and systems to original equipment manufacturers and airlines 
in addition  government systems experienced strong demand from the us government 
international sales were impacted by strong demand from the commercial aerospace market  favorable foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the weakened us dollar  as well as incremental sales from the e s simulation business  partially offset by certain european defense related programs that have completed 
cost of sales total cost of sales is summarized as follows dollars in millions total cost of sales percent of total sales cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes research and development  raw material  labor  facility  product warranty and other related expenses 
cost of sales as a percentage of total sales in in comparison to is relatively flat as increased sales volume  productivity improvements  lower employee incentive compensation costs  and lower retirement benefit costs were offset by the absence of certain net favorable contract related adjustments benefiting and a million favorable adjustment to the restructuring reserve included in cost of sales in the improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of total sales in in comparison to was primarily due to a combination of increased sales volume  productivity improvements  lower retirement benefit costs  and the benefit of a million favorable adjustment to the restructuring reserve included in cost of sales in compared to an million restructuring charge included in cost of sales in these improvements in were partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs and research and development costs 
research and development r d expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows dollars in millions customer funded company funded total percent of total sales r d expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in research and development activities  engineering related product materials and equipment  and subcontracting costs 
total r d expense increased million  or percent  from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased primarily due to several defense related programs that are in their development phases  including the e mission systems upgrade program  the ch g helicopter program  and the modernized user equipment mue program 
the company funded portion of r d expense increased primarily due to spending on certain new business and regional jet platforms  the development of our next generation flight deck and cabin systems for the business aircraft market  and the enhancement of capabilities of other products and systems 
total r d expense increased million  or percent  from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased primarily due to several defense related programs that were in their development phases  including joint tactical radio system jtrs and future combat systems fcs  as well as other networked communications programs and rotary wing and fixed wing flight deck and mission electronic system development programs 
in addition  customer funded development for the boeing and programs contributed to the increase in customer funded r d expense 
the company funded portion of r d expense increased primarily due to spending on certain new business jet platforms  the development of our next generation flight deck and cabin systems for the business aircraft market  and the enhancement of capabilities of other products and systems 
looking forward to  total r d expenses are expected to increase by approximately to percent over and be in the range of million to million  or about percent of total company sales 
the forecast for includes anticipated increases in company funded initiatives in both commercial and government systems  with a lower rate of increase in customer funded programs 
the higher company funded r d  which is expected to represent about percent of total r d expenditures in  is principally due to higher investments related to new air transport  business and regional jet platforms  as well as investments aimed at enhancing the capabilities of our core commercial and government systems products and systems offerings 
these increases will be partially offset by decreases in company funded investments related to the boeing program 
the forecasted increase in customer funded r d is principally related to recently awarded and anticipated government systems development programs including the common range integrated instrumentation criis program  the joint precision approach and landing system jpals program  and the mue program 
selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of total sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility  and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing  research or development activities 
these activities include marketing and business development  finance  legal  information technology  and other administrative and management functions 
sg a expenses increased million to million  or percent of sales  in compared to sg a expenses of million  or percent of sales  in the improvement in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales is attributed primarily to productivity improvements  lower employee incentive compensation costs  and lower retirement benefit costs  partially offset by higher charitable contributions 
sg a expenses increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher sales volume and higher employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by productivity improvements  lower retirement benefit costs and the absence of million of restructuring charges included in sg a in interest expense in millions interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to due primarily to increases in short term borrowings 
interest expense remained flat at million in both and primarily due to an increase in interest rates offset by a lower level of debt outstanding 
other income  net in millions other income  net for information regarding the fluctuations in other income  net  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense dollars in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differed from the united states statutory tax rate for the reasons set forth below statutory tax rate research and development credit extraterritorial income exclusion domestic manufacturing deduction state and local income taxes tax settlements other effective income tax rate the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the benefit from the settlement of certain tax matters  the tax benefits derived from the research and development tax credit r d tax credit  which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental r d expenditures  and the domestic manufacturing deduction under section dmd  which provides a tax benefit on us based manufacturing 
during  the irs and the congressional joint committee on taxation completed their examination of our us tax returns for the taxable years ended september  and as well as our amended returns for the years ended september  and the tax settlements  resulting in a benefit to our effective income tax rate for fiscal year of percentage points 
on the last day of fiscal  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted  which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal r d tax credit from january  to december  our effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a full year of benefit from the federal r d tax credit 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects the retroactive reinstatement of the federal r d tax credit which had previously expired december  on december   the tax relief and health care act of was enacted  which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal r d tax credit from january  to december  the retroactive benefit for the previously expired period from january  to september  lowered our effective tax rate by about percentage points for fiscal year in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act repeals and replaces the federal extraterritorial income exclusion eti with a new deduction for income generated from qualified production activities by us manufacturers 
the eti export tax benefit completely phased out december  and the dmd benefit will be phased in through fiscal for  the available dmd tax benefit was one third of the full benefit that will be available in for  the available dmd tax benefit was two thirds of the full benefit that will be available in in comparison to the benefit we would have received under the eti  the act had an adverse impact on our effective tax rate in and and is expected to have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate for and for  our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of percent to percent in comparison to our effective income tax rate of percent 
the higher forecasted effective income tax rate for is principally due to higher projected taxable income and the absence of any tax settlements 
net income and diluted earnings per share dollars and shares in millions  except per share amounts net income net income as a percent of sales diluted earnings per share weighted average diluted common shares net income in increased percent to million  or percent of sales  from net income in of million  or percent of sales 
diluted earnings per share increased percent in to  compared to in earnings per share growth exceeded the growth rate in net income due to the favorable effect of our share repurchase program 
these increases were primarily due to higher sales volume coupled with productivity improvements 
net income in increased percent to million  or percent of sales  from net income in of million  or percent of sales 
diluted earnings per share increased percent in to  compared to in earnings per share growth exceeded the growth rate in net income due to the favorable effect of our share repurchase program 
these increases were primarily due to higher sales volume coupled with productivity improvements 
segment financial results commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products  and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of original equipment manufacturers oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and fractional and other business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  the financial condition of airlines worldwide  as well as corporate profits 
calendar year is expected to be the third consecutive year in which airbus and boeing  the major air transport aircraft oems  book aggregate new aircraft orders at a higher rate than their annual production  once again adding to their backlog 
the market for new business jets was also strong in as order books of business aviation oems continued to improve and business aviation oems updated their product offerings and continued to increase production rates 
the market for regional aircraft in was also up as a result of a resurgence in the market for turboprop aircraft 
conditions for aftermarket service and support and equipment upgrade activities were relatively modest throughout  as airlines implemented solutions to help reduce their operating costs while business jet owners and operators reduced their aircraft utilization and deferred discretionary spending to offset higher fuel costs 
we believe the current commercial aerospace production rates will see pressure  but be sustained  in calendar year due to a number of factors supporting aircraft delivery rates  including the need for airlines to manage fuel costs with more efficient commercial aircraft types  the deep backlog of air transport  business and regional jet aircraft orders from global customers  and a more significant return of us legacy airlines to the market for new fuel efficient aircraft 
we believe the commercial aerospace aftermarket environment will experience declines as carriers further reduce their fleet capacity to offset reduced travel demand and as business jet operators reduce their aircraft utilization and defer spending on discretionary aviation electronics due to macro economic concerns 
risks to the commercial aerospace market include  among other things the turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel  airline demand for new aircraft  and the availability of financing for new aircraft the occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft the potential ramifications of the negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of our airline and other aircraft operator customers the continued poor financial condition of certain major us airlines risks related to our ability to attain our stated enterprise long term growth targets include  among other things our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements  such as the development of systems and products for the airbus axwb and business and regional jets the development and market acceptance of our information management products and systems we expect commercial systems sales to be approximately flat in compared to this includes the impact of an expected reduction of about million  or nearly percent  in wide body aircraft in flight entertainment ife products and systems revenues 
excluding the wide body aircraft ife products and systems  growth in commercial systems is expected to be approximately percent 
these projections are based on a number of assumptions including growth in aircraft oem deliveries in the mid single digits  after taking into account the impact of the strike at boeing  an percent reduction in worldwide commercial airline fleet capacity excluding new aircraft deliveries and planned retirements  and no growth in global passenger miles 
we project commercial systems operating margins will be incrementally higher than the percent segment operating margins reported in due primarily to our efforts to cut costs and manage discretionary research and development spending

commercial systems sales the following table represents commercial systems sales by product category dollars in millions wide body in flight entertainment products all other air transport aviation electronics total air transport aviation electronics business and regional aviation electronics total percent increase wide body in flight entertainment products wide body ife relate to sales of twin aisle ife products and systems to customers in the air transport aviation electronics market 
all other air transport aviation electronics sales include all other air transport sales  including service and support sales for installed wide body ife 
in september we announced our strategic decision to shift research and development resources away from traditional ife systems for next generation wide body aircraft 
we continue to execute on wide body ife contracts and plan to support our existing customer base  which includes on going service and support activities for wide body ife 
all years have been presented consistent with the above description of air transport aviation electronics revenues 
total air transport aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  in compared to excluding the million decrease in wide body ife revenues  air transport aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  in compared to this sales growth is primarily attributed to higher avionics sales to airlines and oems for new aircraft production as well as higher sales for service and support activities 
this growth in sales was achieved despite the impact of labor strikes at boeing and hawker beechcraft during portions of business and regional aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  in compared to this sales growth is attributed primarily to market share gains and increased demand for new business and regional aircraft partially offset by slightly lower business and regional retrofits and spares sales and lower regulatory mandate program revenues 
total air transport aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  in compared to excluding the million increase in wide body ife revenues due to the timing of certain etes sales  air transport aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  in compared to incremental sales from the e s simulation business contributed million  or percentage points of the revenue growth 
the organic sales increase was primarily due to higher avionics products and systems sales to airlines and oems and higher aftermarket revenues  including initial sales of equipment for boeing simulators  as well as higher service and support revenues 
business and regional aviation electronics sales increased million or percent  in compared to this sales growth was attributed primarily to higher avionics sales to business jet oems and higher aftermarket service and support and avionics retrofit and spares revenues 
the following table represents commercial systems sales based on the type of product or service in millions original equipment aftermarket wide body in flight entertainment products total see the discussion below the commercial systems sales by product category table for a definition of wide body in flight entertainment products 
original equipment sales increased million  or percent  in compared to market share gains and increased demand for new air transport  business and regional aircraft led to higher sales across all three market areas  with particular strength in sales to business and regional aircraft oems 
this growth in sales was achieved despite the impact of labor strikes at boeing and hawker beechcraft during portions of aftermarket sales increased million  or percent  in compared to higher revenues from service and support activities were partially offset by lower business aircraft retrofits and spares revenues as well as lower regulatory mandate program revenues 
original equipment sales increased million  or percent  in compared to this increase was due to higher flight deck air transport avionics as well as higher flight deck business jet avionics products and systems sales 
aftermarket sales increased million  or percent  in compared to incremental sales from the e s simulation business contributed million  or percentage points of the revenue growth 
organic aftermarket sales increased million due to higher sales across all product categories  with particular strength in air transport avionics spares sales resulting from the initial sales of equipment for boeing simulators as well as business and regional aftermarket activities 
commercial systems segment operating earnings dollars in millions segment operating earnings percent of sales commercial systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  to million  or percent of sales  in compared to million  or percent of sales  in the increase in operating earnings and operating margin was primarily due to higher revenues  productivity improvements  and lower employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by higher research and development costs 
commercial systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  to million  or percent of sales  in compared to million  or percent of sales  in the increase in operating earnings and operating margin was primarily due to the combination of higher organic revenues  productivity improvements  and lower retirement benefit costs  partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs and research and development costs 
government systems overview and outlook our government systems business provides communication and electronic systems  products and services for airborne and surface applications to the us department of defense  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
these systems  products and services support airborne fixed wing and rotary  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and international governments  which is generally based on the underlying political landscape and security environment 
the past several years have seen significant increases in the us defense budget that have driven higher demand for the systems and products supplied by our government systems business 
while we expect global defense budgets to continue to increase  we anticipate the rate of such increases to moderate as the volatility of the global threat environment is weighed against budgetary pressures created by the worldwide economic situation 
as it relates more specifically to our government systems business  we expect a higher proportion of global defense budget funds will continue to be allocated to the modernization and replacement of current weapons systems as well as higher priority military transformation initiatives 
we expect that these customer priorities  combined with our strengthening positions in certain faster growing areas of our served defense electronics and communications markets  including transformational defense communications  open systems architecture  and next generation global positioning systems gps solutions  should enable us to continue to deliver above market rates of organic revenue growth 
our involvement in various elements of the joint tactical radio system jtrs and future combat system fcs programs  our wide range of positions for fixed wing and rotary wing cockpit and mission electronics systems including kc refueling tankers and c cargo aircraft  as well as blackhawk  chinook  and sea stallion helicopters  and our strong positions in precision guidance systems for missiles and munitions are examples of significant programs in these faster growing areas that have been  and are expected to continue to be  drivers of our growth going forward 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include  but are not limited to  the potential impacts of geopolitical and economic events  the overall funding and prioritization of the us and international defense budgets  funding for programs we have won at projected levels and without program delays  and our ability to win new business  successfully develop products  and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements 
we expect government systems sales to increase by approximately percent in compared to the revenue growth is expected to be derived from increases in programs focused on avionics and mission electronics solutions for fighters  bombers  and unmanned aerial vehicle platforms  continued demand for avionics upgrades for transport and rotary wing aircraft  and growth in programs focused on communication  computation and display solutions for ground and maritime applications 
revenues from the acquisition of athena technologies now rockwell collins control technologies are expected to contribute approximately one percentage point of government systems revenue growth 
we project government systems operating margins will be slightly higher than the percent segment operating margin reported in primarily due to lower company funded r d  lower sg a expenses  and other productivity improvements 
for additional disclosure on government systems segment operating earnings see note in the consolidated financial statements 
government systems sales the following table represents government systems sales by product category dollars in millions airborne solutions surface solutions total percent increase airborne solutions sales increased million  or percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to higher integrated electronics systems revenues from international c upgrade programs  development program revenues from the e mission system upgrade program  and the german army ch g helicopter program  partially offset by lower sales on the canadian maritime helicopter program 
surface solutions sales increased million  or percent  in compared to incremental sales from the acquisition of itac contributed million  or percentage points  of the revenue growth 
organic surface solutions sales increased million due primarily to higher sales from the ground based gps receiver application module gb gram program  the defense advanced gps receiver dagr program  and the united kingdom ministry of defence precision targeting system program 
these increases were partially offset by lower jtrs development program revenues 
airborne solutions sales increased million  or percent  in compared to sales from acquired businesses  primarily the e s simulation business  contributed million  or percentage points  of the sales growth  while organic sales increased million  or percent 
the increase in organic sales was primarily due to higher arc radio hardware and development program revenues and higher revenues from various rotary and fixed wing aircraft electronics systems programs  partially offset by lower sales from simulation and training programs 
surface solutions sales increased million  or percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to higher dagr equipment sales and higher revenues from jtrs  partially offset by certain european programs that have completed 
government systems segment operating earnings dollars in millions segment operating earnings percent of sales government systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  in compared to primarily due to the combination of higher sales  productivity improvements  and lower employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by the absence of net favorable contract adjustments benefiting government systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  in compared to primarily due to the combination of higher sales  productivity improvements  net favorable contract adjustments  and lower retirement benefit costs  partially offset by higher incentive compensation and research and development costs 
general corporate  net in millions general corporate  net general corporate  net decreased million in in comparison to primarily due to lower employee incentive compensation costs 
general corporate  net was relatively flat in in comparison to as lower retirement benefit costs outpaced higher incentive compensation costs 
retirement plans net benefit expense income for pension benefits and other retirement benefits is as follows in millions pension benefits other retirement benefits net benefit expense income pension benefits we have historically provided pension benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
over the past number of years  the cost of providing retirement benefits under a defined benefit structure has become increasingly uncertain due to changes in discount rates and the volatility in the stock market 
in response  we amended our us qualified and non qualified pension plans in covering all salary and hourly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements to discontinue benefit accruals for salary increases and services rendered after september  the pension amendment and made significant contributions to our pension plans 
concurrently  we replaced this benefit by supplementing our existing defined contribution savings plan to include an additional company contribution effective october  the supplemental contribution to our existing defined contribution savings plan was million and million for and  respectively 
we believe our benefit structure achieves our objective of providing benefits that are both valued by our employees and whose costs and funding requirements are more consistent and predictable over the long term 
defined benefit pension expense income for the years ended september    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the funded status of our pension plans in and  primarily due to increases in the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and the pension amendment  were the primary drivers for the decrease in defined benefit pension expense in and in comparison to during the funded status of our pension plans declined from a deficit of million at september  to a deficit of million at september   primarily due to losses on our pension plan assets  partially offset by an increase in the discount rate from percent to percent used to measure our us pension obligations 
in defined benefit pension plan income is expected to increase by approximately million to million 
the expected increase is primarily due to the favorable impact of an increase in the defined benefit pension plan valuation discount rate from percent to percent used to measure our pension expense  partially offset by the impact of losses incurred on our pension plan assets 
our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make discretionary contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
although we do not anticipate we will be required to make any contributions to our us qualified pension plan by governmental regulations in  we plan to make a discretionary contribution of million in to further improve the funded status of this plan 
contributions to our international plans and our us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits we have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees 
we have undertaken two major actions over the past number of years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits in july of  the pre and post retiree medical plans were amended to establish a fixed contribution to be paid by us 
additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount 
this amendment has eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we amended our retiree medical plans on june  to discontinue post prescription drug coverage effective january  upon termination of these benefits  post retirees will have the option of receiving these benefits through medicare 
on average  we expect that the prescription drug benefit to be provided by medicare will be better than the benefit provided by our current post drug plan as a result of the fixed company contribution plan design implemented in other retirement benefits income for the years ended september    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
we expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately million in  primarily due to the elimination of favorable amortization for a plan amendment that will no longer benefit other retirement benefits expense income 
financial condition and liquidity cash flow summary our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners 
during significant cash expenditures aimed at future growth and enhanced shareowner value were as follows million of share repurchases million of property additions million of dividend payments million related to the acquisition of athena operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in compared to is primarily due to the impact of higher net income and lower pension plan contributions  partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation payments  higher income tax payments  and lower advance payments from customers 
increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in compared to was primarily due to higher net income  partially offset by higher income tax payments and increases in working capital  particularly inventories and receivables  to support higher sales volumes and the launch of new commercial and military aircraft programs 
in cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of million to million  an anticipated increase of about percent over cash provided by operating activities 
we expect the projected increase to be principally due to the positive impact of higher net income and improved working capital performance in the areas of inventories and receivables  partially offset by higher income tax payments and a higher level of deferred pre production engineering costs related to new aircraft programs 
the projected cash provided by operating activities range includes a planned discretionary us qualified defined benefit pension plan contribution of million 
investing activities in millions cash used for investing activities the million increase in cash used for investing activities during compared to was primarily due to the following million related to the acquisition of athena in april compared to million related to the acquisition of itac in august million of additional capital expenditures in due to the construction of new engineering facilities in cedar rapids  iowa and richardson  texas as well as an increased level of investment in test equipment  all in support of recent program wins 
benefited from a million recovery of a license fee paid to the boeing company in prior years as a result of the boeing company exiting the high speed broadband communication connectivity markets 
in we received million as a result of a purchase price adjustment related to the e s simulation business 
net cash paid for acquisitions was million in compared to million in capital expenditures decreased to million in from million in we also received proceeds of million in from the recovery of a license fee  while in we received proceeds of million from the sale of rockwell scientific company  llc  an equity affiliate that was jointly owned with rockwell automation  inc we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
capital expenditures are primarily focused on investments in test equipment in support of recent and anticipated program wins that continue to drive our growth 
financing activities in millions cash used for financing activities the change in cash used for financing activities in as compared to is attributed to the following factors in we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million compared to repurchases of million shares at a cost of million in in addition  in we paid million related to the settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in we had proceeds from short term borrowings of million in compared to no borrowings in we repaid million of long term debt in compared to no repayments of long term debt in we paid cash dividends of million during compared to million in we received million from the exercise of stock options in compared to million in we received million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in compared to million in the change in cash used for financing activities in as compared to is attributed to the following factors in we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million compared to repurchases of million shares at a cost of million in in addition  in we paid million related to the settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in in we received million from the exercise of stock options compared to million in in we paid cash dividends of million compared to million in in we repaid million of the million long term variable rate loan facilities that were entered into in share repurchase program strong cash flow from operations provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows in millions  except per share amounts amount of share repurchases number of shares repurchased weighted average price per share in we paid million  which is reflected in the table above  related to the settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in dividends we declared and paid cash dividends of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash dividends in was the result of an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from cents to cents per share beginning with the dividend paid june  the increase in cash dividends in was the result of an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from cents to cents per share beginning with the dividend paid june  based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of dividends  however  will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
liquidity in addition to cash provided by operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our primary source of short term liquidity is through borrowings in the commercial paper market 
our access to that market is facilitated by the strength of our credit ratings and our million committed credit facility with several banks revolving credit facility 
our current ratings as provided by moody s investors service moody s  standard poor s and fitch  inc are a a a  respectively  for long term debt and p a f  respectively  for short term debt 
moody s  standard poor s and fitch  inc have stable outlooks on our credit rating 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes may bear interest or may be sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than days from time of issuance 
borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 
to date  we have been able to utilize our commercial paper program to fund working capital needs and other general corporate purposes and have not been impacted by the tightening of the credit markets 
at september   short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding were million with a weighted average interest rate and maturity period of percent and days  respectively 
our revolving credit facility consists of an million five year unsecured revolving credit agreement entered into on may  and amended in to extend the term to  with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to billion 
these options are subject to the approval of the lenders 
the revolving credit facility exists primarily to support our commercial paper program  but is available to us in the event our access to the commercial paper market is impaired or eliminated 
our only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent  excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  was percent 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants that require us to satisfy certain conditions in order to incur debt secured by liens  engage in sale leaseback transactions  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness 
we had no borrowings at september  under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  short term credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to million as of september   of which million was utilized to support commitments in the form of commercial letters of credit 
there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities 
there were million of short term borrowings outstanding under our foreign subsidiaries credit facilities as of september  in addition to our credit facilities and commercial paper program  we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  which expires on november   covering up to million in debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or warrants that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
on november   we issued million of debt due december  the notes under the shelf registration statement 
the notes contain covenants that require us to satisfy certain conditions in order to incur debt secured by liens  engage in sale leaseback transactions  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
at september   million of the shelf registration was available for future use 
during june we entered into two variable rate loan agreements as follows five year unsecured variable rate loan facility agreement for million british pounds million 
this loan facility was repaid in five year unsecured variable rate loan facility agreement for million euros million 
our outstanding variable rate loan facility agreement contains customary loan covenants  none of which are financial covenants 
failure to comply with customary covenants or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the agreement would require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
as of september   million was outstanding under our variable rate loan facility agreement 
if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to the commercial paper market and an increase in the cost of borrowing 
in the event that we do not have access to the commercial paper market  alternative sources of funding could include borrowings under the revolving credit facility  funds available from the issuance of securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   other than operating leases  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our consolidated statement of financial position  or variable interests in entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to our company

see note in the consolidated financial statements 
we lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases 
our commitments under these operating leases  in the form of non cancelable future lease payments  are not reflected as a liability on our statement of financial position 
purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts 
purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable 
purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need 
generally  items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our statement of financial position 
the table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million at september   as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note in the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts  or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made 
income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies  and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws  and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual net income by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas fin 
see note in the consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with fin  deferred taxes  and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios  and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows 
our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete 
discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations 
our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of yielded no impairments 
if there was a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to our in flight entertainment products and extended warranty terms across all businesses 
at september   we have recorded million of warranty liabilities 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we have historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note in the consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and related pension expense 
the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension expense caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows change in assumption dollars in millions basis point increase basis point decrease assumption pension obligation discount rate pension expense decrease pension expense increase expected long term rate of return on plan assets pension expense decrease pension expense increase inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our statement of financial position 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior and practices provided there are no abrupt changes in market conditions 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from the following our in flight entertainment inventory  which tends to experience quicker technological obsolescence than our other products 
in flight entertainment inventory at september  was million 
life time buy inventory  which consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 
at september   we had million of inventory valuation reserves recorded on  million of total inventory on hand 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less basis points by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would have decreased or increased the fair value of our long term debt  exclusive of the effects of the interest rate swap contracts  by million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the million notional value of interest rate swap contracts was a million asset at september  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by million and million  respectively 
at september   we also had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding and variable rate short term borrowings of million 
our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates related to variable rate debt 
inclusive of the effect of the interest rate swaps  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would not have a material effect on operations or cash flows 
for more information related to outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments  see notes and in the consolidated financial statements in item below 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies which subjects our cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes to foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to manage this exposure through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts foreign currency contracts 
all foreign currency contracts are executed with banks we believe to be creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
the majority of our non functional currency firm and anticipated receivables and payables are hedged using foreign currency contracts 
it is our policy not to manage exposure to net investments in foreign subsidiaries or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts were million and million at september  and  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates 
principal currencies that are hedged include the european euro  british pound sterling  and japanese yen 
the duration of foreign currency contracts is generally two years or less 
the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at september  and were net liabilities of million and million  respectively 
a percent increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million
