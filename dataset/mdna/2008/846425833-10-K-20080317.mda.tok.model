we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method beginning january  accordingly  we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  were in effect for expense recognition purposes  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
the impact on our results of operations of recording stock based compensation for the fiscal years ended december  and was as follows in thousands station operating expenses corporate expenses total stock based compensation expense we were required to issue warrants to the international church of the foursquare gospel icfg from the date that icfg ceased to broadcast its programming over kzab fm and kzba fm until the closing of the acquisition of kxol fm 
on each of march  april  may  june  july  august  and september   we granted icfg a warrant exercisable for  shares an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of      and per share  respectively 
the warrant issued on september  was the final warrant required under the amended time brokerage agreement due to the closing of the acquisition of kxol fm 
we assigned these warrants an aggregate fair market value of approximately million based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair market value of each warrant was recorded as a nonrecurring stock based programming expense on the respective date of grant 
during fiscal year  all of the warrants issued expired  unexercised

during the fiscal year ended december   we repaid million of the outstanding indebtedness  redemption premiums and accrued interest under a senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes due we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million  which was related to the write off of the related unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums 
our income tax expense differs from the statutory federal tax rate of and related statutory state tax rates  primarily as a result of the application of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities related to our intangible assets could no longer be assured over our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  our effective book tax rate is impacted by establishing a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
on december   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

under sfas no 
 discontinued businesses or assets held for sale are removed from the results of continuing operations 
we determined that the sales of kpti fm serving the san francisco  california market  kley fm and ksah am serving the san antonio  texas market and ktcy fm serving the dallas  texas market  each met the criteria in accordance with sfas no 
the results of operations of these stations  including the gains on the sales of these assets  were classified as discontinued operations in the selected historical consolidated statements of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest publicly traded hispanic controlled media and entertainment company in the united states 
we own and or operate radio stations in markets that reach approximately of the us hispanic population  and two television stations  which reach approximately million households in the south florida market  and nationally throughout the us on directv m s 
our radio stations are located in six of the top ten hispanic markets of los angeles  new york  puerto rico  chicago  miami and san francisco 
los angeles and new york have the largest and second largest hispanic populations  and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the united states in terms of advertising revenue  respectively 
our two television stations operate as one television operation  branded megatv 
as part of our operating business  we also operate lamusica 
com  mega 
tv  and our radio station websites which are bilingual spanish english websites providing content related to latin music  entertainment  news and culture 
we also occasionally produce live concerts and events throughout the united states and puerto rico 
on march   we acquired television stations wsbs tv channel  formerly known as wdlp tv and its derivative digital television station wsbs dt channel  formerly known as wdlp dt in key west  florida and wsbs ca channel  formerly known as wdlp ca in miami  florida  serving the south florida market 
on march   we also launched megatv  our general interest spanish language television operation 
megatv s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs  ranging from televised radio branded shows to general entertainment programs  such as music  celebrity  debate  interviews and personality based shows 
as part of our strategy  we have incorporated certain of our on air personalities into our programming  as well as including interactive elements to complement our internet websites 
we have developed approximately of our programming and have commissioned other content from spanish language production partners 
our television revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming 
the success of each of our stations depends significantly upon its audience ratings and share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
the broadcasting industry is a highly competitive business  but some barriers to entry do exist 
each of our stations competes with both spanish language and english language stations in its market  as well as with other advertising media  such as newspapers  cable television  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  satellite radio and television  transit advertising and direct mail marketing 
factors which are material to our competitive position include management experience  our stations rank in their markets  signal strength and frequency  and audience demographics  including the nature of the spanish language market targeted by a particular station 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of advertising time on our stations to local and national advertisers 
our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates that our stations are able to charge  as well as the overall demand for advertising time in each respective market 
seasonal net broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising demand from local and national advertisers 
typically for the broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue 
our most significant operating expenses are compensation expenses  programming expenses  professional fees and advertising and promotional expenses 
our senior management strives to control these expenses  as well as other expenses  by working closely with local station management and others  including vendors

we have contingencies that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above contractual obligation table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations 
however  we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and  when appropriate and if available  will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our first lien credit facility and all other debt instruments as of december   and expect to continue to be in compliance in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
accounting for intangible assets our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc broadcast licenses 
fcc licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the telecommunications act of the act 
the act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if i it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act of or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations  which taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so 
historically  there has been no material challenge to our license renewals 
in addition  the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
we do not amortize our fcc licenses 
we test these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs that may indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which assumes the fcc licenses are acquired and operated by a third party 
this income approach incorporates variables such as types of signals  media competition  audience share  market advertising revenue  market revenue projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
in the preparation of the fcc license appraisals  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of the intangible asset 
these estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results 
we generally test for impairment on our fcc license intangible assets at the individual license level 
however  we have applied the guidance in eitf  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf  to certain of our fcc license intangible assets 
eitf states that separately recorded indefinite lived intangible assets should be combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset and  as such  are 
table of contents essentially inseparable from one another 
we aggregate fcc licenses for impairment testing if their signals are simulcast and are operating as one revenue producing asset 
our goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations  when a business has been acquired under the applicable accounting literature 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units under sfas no 
 radio and television 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit 
accordingly  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended  and  we performed an annual impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes 
as a result  we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  on the date of adoption  we established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interest and penalties on tax liabilities  if any  would be recorded in interest expense and other non interest expense  respectively 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers  age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred bad debt expense of million  million 
table of contents and million  respectively 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  a fixed and determinable price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
agency commissions  where applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue 
advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings  less their commission  to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances 
contingencies and litigations we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market risks 
our primary market risk is a change in interest rates associated with borrowings under the first lien credit facility 
advances under the first lien credit facility bear base rate or eurodollar rate interest  plus applicable margins  which vary in accordance with prevailing economic conditions 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
at december   all of our debt  other than our first lien credit facility and the mortgage for the sbs miami broadcast center  had fixed interest rates 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  on june   we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement that hedged fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on our current eurodollar rate of our million first lien credit facility at an interest rate for five years at  plus the applicable margin of 
also  on january   we entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement that hedged fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on our current eurodollar rate of our million mortgage at an interest rate for ten years at 
these agreements are intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and were not entered into for speculative purposes 
as a result  we believe that interest rate risk is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of december   the rates under our swap agreement were unfavorable compared to the market 
we will continue to evaluate swap rates as the market dictates 
they serve to stabilize our cash flow and expense but ultimately may cost more or less in interest than if we had carried all of our debt at a variable rate over the swap term 
under a hypothetical situation  if variable interest rates average higher in than they did during  our variable interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to million for if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and short term investment balances at december  our credit exposure under our interest rate swap agreement reflects the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of nonperformance by our counter party 
as a result  we selected a high credit quality financial institution as a counter party 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter party  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter party s nonperformance 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the broad range of markets in which we operate and a diverse group of advertisers
