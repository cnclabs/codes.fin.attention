net loss income as a result of the factors discussed above  we recorded a net loss of million in compared to net income of million for liquidity and capital resources the company s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for online and offline advertising promoting digital diet and meal delivery programs to potential subscribers 
advertising expense in the first half of the year usually exceeds advertising in the second half of the year due to seasonality in the weight loss business 
as a result we have historically experienced proportionally lower or negative cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of each year 
we expect that trend to continue going forward 
the amount of advertising and its effectiveness is a significant driver of the company s operations 
our advertising commitments are typically short term in nature with most of it purchased on the spot market 
the trend is expected to continue going forward 
at december   we had net working capital of million  compared to net working capital of million at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  an increase of million from the balance of million at december  in our principal source of liquidity was borrowing million with a three year term from our largest shareholder to invest in opportunities to grow the business  including advertising our meal delivery program and upgrading our technology platform 
prior to we utilized equity financing to fund operating cash deficits 
at the present time we believe that we have adequate cash to fund our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
to the extent we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business  we may seek to undertake additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have never declared a dividend or paid a cash dividend 
we currently intend to retain any earnings for use in the business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

for the year ended december   we used million of cash in investing activities 
the cash usage was primarily due to the acquisition of nutrio in may for million  changes in restricted cash of million and purchases of computer equipment and software development costs of million 
cash flows from financing activities our financing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december  the cash provided was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds from the related party senior secured note and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by repayment of capital lease obligations of million

the cash provided for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock to prides capital and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations of million and common stock issuance costs of million 
cash flows from discontinued operations for the year ended december   we used  in operating activities related to certain unprofitable european websites prior to transferring them to a third party in september contractual obligations the following summarizes future cash outflow related to our non cancelable contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years after years contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating leases advertising senior secured note total contractual cash obligations in the third quarter of we borrowed million from prides capital partners  llc  the company s largest shareholder  in the form of a senior secured note and accompanying agreements 
the note calls for semi annual interest payments of per annum 
the interest can be paid in cash or in equity at our discretion 
the proceeds from the note will be used to invest in advertising to grow the business  our technology platform upgrade and for general corporate purposes 
the maturity date of the note is august  the note has a conversion feature allowing prides to exercise an option to require us to repay the note at maturity through the issuance of equity at per share 
we also entered into a capital lease obligation of approximately million to finance a portion of our technology platform upgrade in the third quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable based upon information presently available 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
all of our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  of this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition we offer subscriptions to the proprietary content contained in our web sites 
revenues from customer subscriptions currently represent the majority of our business and are paid in advance mainly via credit cards 
subscriptions to digital plans are paid in advance and cash receipts are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period of the digital plans subscription 
in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  we recognize gross digital plans subscription revenues associated with licensed diet and fitness plans based on the relevant facts of the related license agreements  while the license fee incurred to the licensor is included in cost of revenues 
we collect digital plans subscription amounts in advance and maintain a reserve for refunds related to cancelable plans 
under cancelable plans  digital plans subscribers are entitled to cancel their memberships after an initial length of stay and receive a refund of only the unused portion of the membership 
meal delivery revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete  which is upon transfer of title of the product 
this transfer occurs upon shipment from the company s fulfillment center to the end customer 
meal delivery revenue includes amounts billed for shipping 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize gross meal delivery revenues based on the relevant fact that we are the primary obligor and have assumed asset risk before the customers place any orders 
business to business revenue relates to our ediets corporate services subsidiary 
ediets corporate services generates three types of business to business revenue 
licensing and development revenues are accounted for in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
development revenue relates to the planning  design and development of web sites for our customers 
both licensing and development revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the license period once the web site is launched 
consulting revenue relates to consulting services provided to customers and revenue is recognized when services and or deliverables are completed and collection is probable 
advertising revenue is recognized in the period the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection is probable 
our obligations typically include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions or times that visitors to our web site view an advertisement 
amounts received or billed for which impressions have not yet been delivered are reflected as deferred revenue 
opt in email revenue is derived from the sale of email addresses of visitors to our web sites who have authorized us to allow third party solicitations 
revenues from the collection of email addresses are recognized when no significant obligation remains and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is derived from the year exclusive technology licensing agreement related to the company s operations in the united kingdom and ireland and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  as well as an ongoing royalty agreement on future digital plans subscriptions and advertising revenue derived from the ownership transfer of the german  spanish and portuguese web sites 
our most significant accounting estimate is our reserve for refunds 
since all digital plans subscriber payments are deferred upon receipt  at the end of each month we reclassify a portion of our deferred revenue to reserve for refunds 
based on historical experience  approximately of digital plans subscriber sales will result in a refund issued in a subsequent month after sale 
all other refunds issued relate to current month digital plans subscriber sales 
because the revenue has not been recognized  refunds do not result in a reversal of digital plans subscription revenue 
instead  refunds result in a decrease to the amounts maintained in deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our estimates used for reserve for refunds 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions stated above  we may be exposed to income or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets sfas describes the reporting unit as an operating segment as that term is used in fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
we operate in a single market consisting of the sale of services  information and products related to nutrition  fitness and motivation 
we have three reportable segments the us business to consumer segment  the us business to business segment and the european business segment 
we evaluate goodwill annually along these segment lines which represent our reporting units 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair value of the company s reporting units is based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
assumptions used in our impairment testing  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  and could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our impairment testing may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed impairment testing for our european segment due to uncertainty regarding future license revenue prospects since we received communication from our largest customer noting its intent to terminate the current license agreement 
as a result  we determined that the intangible assets  specifically the technology licensing agreement  were impaired 
this resulted in a non cash impairment of intangible assets of approximately million and a non cash impairment of goodwill of approximately million to reduce the segment s goodwill to zero 
at december  we had million in goodwill 
approximately million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the may acquisition of nutrio and the remaining million of goodwill related to the us business to consumer reporting unit 
this goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and we noted no impairment as of december  accounting for employee stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  and related interpretations sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that method  compensation cost recognized in includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation is being recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for the prior periods have not been restated 
we also account for certain options and restricted share awards using variable accounting under sfas r as interpreted by eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf  which requires that such costs be measured at the end of each reporting period to account for changes in the fair value of our common stock until the stock options or restricted shares are vested 
common stock is valued using the market price of common stock on the measurement date as defined in eitf for such grants 
the fair value of restricted stock and vested shares is determined by the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires estimates of the expected term of the option  the volatility of the company s stock price  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
we recognize expense for all share based awards based on the fair value of the number of awards we estimate will fully vest 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the estimated fair value of share based awards and the underlying expense recorded 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate 
accounting for income taxes effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with a few jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
certain factors which may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our condition and prospects 
these factors may have a significant impact on our future operating results 
we depend on several internet sites to attract users to our website  and our business could suffer if our advertising is discontinued on these sites 
a significant portion of our online traffic has come  and we believe will continue to come  from agreements with internet sites that expire at various times in and beyond 
advertising rates on these sites have accelerated markedly in recent years 
this acceleration has presented a challenge for us to obtain customers through these sites on a profitable basis 
moreover  we expect our current agreements with these sites to be renewed at terms and conditions at least as costly as those that are expiring 
if our advertising is discontinued for any reason on the sites on which we currently advertise  our business could suffer 
as the largest stockholder  prides capital has significant influence over our company 
prides capital will own approximately of our outstanding voting common stock in the event all warrants are exercised 
therefore  as a practical matter  prides capital will have significant influence over the outcome of any shareholder vote  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
additionally  concentration of control in one stockholder may discourage potential investors from providing additional financing if we need it 
the company purchase agreement also affords prides capital certain participation rights and anti dilution protections which could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing or to effect a merger or other business combination transaction 
in addition  under the terms of the company purchase agreement  as long as prides capital owns at least of our outstanding common stock  the following require the approval of a majority vote of our board of directors  which majority must include at least one prides capital director authorize  create  designate  establish or issue any other class or series of capital stock ranking senior to our capital stock as to dividends or upon liquidation  or reclassification of any shares of our capital stock into shares having any preference or priority as to dividends or upon liquidation superior to any such preference or priority of our common stock  adopt a plan for the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our company or any recapitalization plans  amend  alter or repeal  whether by merger  consolidation or otherwise our certificate of incorporation  alter or change the rights  preferences or privileges of our common stock or the warrants issued to prides capital  or directly or indirectly  declare or pay any dividend other than dividends payable in shares of our common stock or directly or indirectly purchase  redeem  purchase or otherwise acquire any share of our common stock except for shares of our common stock repurchased from current or former employees  consultants  or directors upon termination of service in accordance with plans approved by our board of directors whether in cash  securities or property or in our obligations 
we rely on qualified  key executive management personnel 
the success of our business will also depend on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified key executive management personnel  particularly in the marketing  administrative and financial areas 
competition for qualified personnel in the internet industry is intense 
if we are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
we can t be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms if we need it 
we believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs through at least the next months 
however  due to unforeseen circumstances  unanticipated changes in our plans or other factors beyond our control  we may require additional financing 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when we may require it or if it is only available on unfavorable terms 
because of our limited operating history we may fail to manage our expansion and expected growth effectively  which could strain our resources and could impair the expansion of our business 
although we have continued to grow our revenues  a failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our subscribers and advertising partners 
we have increased the scope of our operations  including our technology  sales  administrative and marketing organizations 
these factors have placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures to expand  train and manage our workforce in order to manage our expected growth 
we face significant competition 
in addition to weight watchers international  inc  waterfront media  inc and nutrisystem  inc 
we currently compete with several internet sites which provide diet and nutrition information  including weightwatchers 
com 
we know of several other online competitors aggressively marketing online programs which may be somewhat similar to ours  including some that are offered at no charge to the customer 
increased competition and a proliferation of free online diet plans could result in reductions in the prices we receive for our programs  lower margins  loss of customers and reduced visitor traffic to our web site 
several of our existing competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and may be able to devote greater resources for the development and promotion of their services and products 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive marketing and advertising efforts  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to advertisers and alliance partners 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete successfully 
because of volatility in the advertising markets which we target  we may not be able to effectively attract and retain subscribers 
we are currently dependent in large part on the online advertising market to attract and retain subscribers to our digital plans and meal delivery service 
we expect the online advertising market to continue to be subject to higher costs  thereby significantly impacting our costs to acquire and retain subscribers 
although we are currently developing alternative channels of customer acquisition  including television  print and radio advertising  there can be no assurance that these measures will as effectively attract and retain subscribers as have our online advertising programs in the past 
we depend heavily on our network infrastructure and its failure could result in unanticipated expenses and prevent our subscribers from effectively utilizing our services  which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers and advertisers 
our ability to successfully create and deliver our content depends in large part on the capacity  reliability and security of our networking hardware  software and telecommunications infrastructure 
failures of our network infrastructure could result in unanticipated expenses to address such failures and could prevent our subscribers from effectively utilizing our services  which could prevent us from retaining and attracting subscribers and advertisers 
the hardware infrastructures on which our system operates are located in sterling  virginia  miami  florida and lithia springs  georgia 
we do not currently have a formal disaster recovery plan 
our system is susceptible to natural and man made disasters  including war  terrorism  earthquakes  fires  floods  power loss and vandalism 
further  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems could adversely affect the operation of our systems 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any damages or interruptions in our systems 
accordingly  we could incur capital expenditures in the event of unanticipated damage 
in addition  our subscribers depend on internet service providers  or isps  for access to our web site 
in the past  isps and web sites have experienced significant system failures and could  in the future  experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these problems could harm our business by preventing our subscribers from effectively utilizing our services 
the unauthorized access of confidential member information that we transmit over public networks could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers 
our subscribers transmit confidential information to us over public networks  and the unauthorized access of such information by third parties could harm our reputation and significantly hinder our efforts to attract and retain subscribers 
we rely on a variety of security techniques and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect customer transaction data and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
problems with the performance and reliability of the internet infrastructure could adversely affect the quality and reliability of the services we offer our subscribers and advertisers 
we depend significantly on the internet infrastructure to deliver attractive  reliable and timely e mail messages to our subscribers 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth  and its performance and reliability may decline  which could adversely affect our ability to sustain revenue growth 
among other things  continued development of the internet infrastructure will require a reliable network backbone with necessary speed  data capacity and security 
currently  there are regular failures of the internet network infrastructure  including outages and delays  and the frequency of these failures may increase in the future 
these failures may reduce the benefits of our services to our subscribers and undermine our advertising partners and our subscribers confidence in the internet as a viable commercial medium 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the development or adoption of new technology required to accommodate increased levels of internet activity or due to government regulation 
these factors could adversely affect our business by adversely affecting the quality and reliability of the services we offer our customers 
we may have to litigate to protect our rights or to defend claims brought against us by third parties  and such litigation may subject us to significant liability and be time consuming and expensive 
we face a substantial risk of litigation  including litigation regarding intellectual property rights in internet related businesses 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and still evolving 
we may have to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or defend ourselves against claims of violating the proprietary rights of third parties 
we also face the risk of having to defend against lawsuits brought by third parties related to our business activities 
for example  we depend heavily on internet advertising  and we are currently involved in both civil litigation and administrative proceedings arising out of pop up ads and other advertising practices  in both cases brought by one of our competitors 
if the outcome of these proceedings  or similar proceedings that we may face in the future  were to make certain types of advertising unavailable to us  then our marketing may become less effective and our financial results could suffer 
any of this type of litigation may subject us to significant liability for damages  result in invalidation of our proprietary rights  be time consuming and expensive to defend  even if not meritorious  and result in the diversion of management time and attention 
any of these factors could adversely affect our business operations and financial results and condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties of doing business on the internet could significantly increase our costs and expenses 
laws and regulations that apply to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent and these laws and regulations could significantly increase the costs we incur in using the internet to conduct our business 
the united states congress has recently enacted internet legislation regarding children s privacy  commercial email  copyright and taxation 
the european union has recently adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may result in limits on the collection and use of member information 
a number of other laws and regulations  including those at the state or local level  may be adopted that regulate the use of the internet 
these may include laws addressing user privacy  pricing  acceptable content  taxation  use of the telecommunications infrastructure  commercial email and quality of products and services 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws  including those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
as a result of these uncertainties  we may incur unanticipated  significant costs and expenses that could impact our financial results and condition 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
in the past three years our stock has closed at prices ranging from a high of on march   to a low of on march  if our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if operating expenditures exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the market price of our common stock has been in the past  and could in the future  be materially and adversely affected for reasons unrelated to our specific business or results of operations 
general market price declines or volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  short term trading strategies of certain investors can also have a significant effect on the price of specific securities 
the exercise of warrants or options may depress our stock price 
there are a significant number of warrants and options to purchase our common stock outstanding at prices ranging from to per share 
holders may sell the common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrants and options at a market price that exceeds the exercise price of the warrants and options paid by the holders 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by holders of warrants or options may depress the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of our equity securities 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the business 
therefore  you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock in the form of dividends 
we have authorized but unissued preferred stock  which could affect rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividends  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt 
although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time  we may do so in the future 
we may enter into business combinations and strategic alliances which could be difficult to integrate and may disrupt our business 
we completed the nutrio acquisition on may  and may continue to pursue expansion of our operations or market presence by entering into additional business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies 
these transactions create risks such as difficulty assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  disruption of our ongoing business  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets  additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses  responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses  and impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners 
the nutrio acquisition includes all of the risks outlined above and may lead to a reduction of operating income if we are not able to successfully integrate the customers  employees and products into our offerings 
we will need to keep pace with rapid technological change in the e commerce and internet subscription diet and wellness plan industries 
in order to remain competitive  we will be continually required to enhance and to improve the functionality and features of our subscription products and web site  which could require us to invest significant capital 
if our competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  our existing services  technology  and systems may become obsolete and we may not have the funds or technical know how to upgrade our services  technology  and systems 
we may face material delays in introducing new services  products  and enhancements 
if such delays occur  our users may forego use of our services and select those of our competitors  in which event  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on a third party to provide us with adequate food supplies and fulfillment services  the loss of any of which could harm our meal delivery business 
we currently depend on a single third party meal delivery vendor for manufacture and fulfillment of our prepared meals with its operations centered in one location 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity  quality and variety of food and fulfillment of customer orders in a timely and low cost manner from this manufacturer  we will be unable to adequately fulfill our customers orders which would adversely affect our operating results and damage the value of our brand 
if we pursue competitive advertising  we may be subject to litigation from our competitors 
if we pursue competitive advertising  our competitors may pursue litigation regardless of its merit and chances of success 
defending such litigation may be lengthy and costly  strain our resources and divert management s attention from growing the business  which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
changes discretionary spending and the availability of consumer credit could negatively impact our operating results 
because our meal delivery offerings consist of freshly prepared meals  they are priced higher than major competitors such as nutrisystem and jenny craig 
the success of our meal delivery business is therefore dependent on customers willingness and ability to invest a larger percentage of discretionary spending to our meal delivery products than may be required with our competitors products 
a decline in our customers discretionary spending could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
more generally  our business could be adversely affected by broader economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in disposable consumer income  as well as any reduction in the accessibility of credit card debt which facilitates most of our customer transactions 
the sale of prepared meals and nutritional supplements involves product liability and other risks 
we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our prepared meal delivery products and nutritional supplements results in illness or injury 
in the us we are subject to laws and regulations  including those administered by the united states department of agriculture and food and drug administration that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products 
we may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants  are improperly labeled  include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings 
product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as our contract indemnification rights and existing insurance coverage may not be adequate 
distributors of food products  vitamins  and nutritional supplements are frequently named as defendants in product liability lawsuits 
the successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim  a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management 
product liability litigation or regulatory action  even if not meritorious  is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio as the interest rate related to our million debt is fixed 
investments are made in accordance with our investment policy and consist of money market funds 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk 
due to the nature of these financial instruments the interest rate risk is deemed to be low 
we estimate that the cost of these financial instruments approximates fair value at december  foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros and british sterling pounds and fluctuations of the euro and british sterling pounds as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk
