market area national penn is headquartered in boyertown  berks county  pennsylvania 
boyertown is located in eastern berks county  which strategically positions national penn between philadelphia to the southeast  allentown and bethlehem to the northeast  and reading and lancaster to the west 
during  we primarily served communities throughout southeastern pennsylvania 
specifically  in we served a nine county market area in pennsylvania berks  bucks  chester  delaware  lancaster  lehigh  montgomery  northampton and philadelphia  as well as the cecil county  md area 
within this geographic region  there are five distinct market areas the reading berks county area  an area in which the service industry is increasingly replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the allentown lehigh valley area  consisting of lehigh and northampton counties  also an area in which a growing service industry is replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the five county philadelphia metropolitan area  consisting of philadelphia and its suburbs in bucks  chester  delaware and montgomery counties  lancaster county  an area with a significant agricultural economy  and centre county  consisting of the state college bellefonte area

see recent developments herein 
competition the banking and financial services industry is extremely competitive in our market area 
we face vigorous competition for customers  loans and deposits from many companies  including commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  trust companies  mortgage companies  money market mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment firms 
many of these competitors are significantly larger than national penn  have greater resources  lending limits and larger branch systems  offer a wider array of banking services than national penn  and are long established in their geographic markets some of which have only been recently entered by national penn 
see general development of business below 
in addition  some of these competitors are subject to a lesser degree of regulation than that imposed on national penn 
many of these competitors have elected to become financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act of  including many of the largest ones 
this development will likely further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
see gramm leach bliley act below 
business strategy our goal is to become the most highly regarded financial institution in the markets we serve 
we intend to accomplish this goal by combining the sophisticated products and fee based services of a major regional financial services company with the personal attention  service and responsiveness of a community bank holding company 
we believe this strategy results in greater profitability than a typical community bank 
the primary components of our business strategy are commercial banking  consumer banking  niche marketing  development of fee income  and enhanced customer service 
commercial banking 
commercial banking has been our historic and ongoing business focus 
our business customers tend to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between million and million who generally do not receive the attention of our larger  more nationally focused competitors 
many of these customers require us to have a high degree of understanding of their business in order for us to be able to customize solutions to their financial requirements 
we believe that this helps to distinguish us from our competitors 
we offer a wide range of products including short term loans for seasonal and working capital purposes  term loans secured by real estate and other assets  loans for construction and expansion needs  revolving credit plans and sophisticated cash management services 
we also are active in commercial real estate lending  including loans to developers of both residential and commercial projects 
as of december   our commercial loan portfolio was billion  which represents of our total loans outstanding 
another important component of our commercial lending practice is our emphasis on small businesses and their unique needs 
in order to serve small businesses better  national penn bank is an approved sba preferred express lender by the us small business administration 
being a preferred express lender authorizes us to underwrite and approve qualifying small business loans without the prior approval of the small business administration 
during  national penn bank originated over million of loans that qualified for us small business administration guarantees 
consumer banking 
we offer a full range of deposit accounts  which include demand  now  money market  certificates of deposit and other checking and savings accounts 
we also offer consumer loan products such as installment loans  home equity loans  residential mortgage loans  multi family loans  educational loans and credit cards 
in addition  we offer automated teller services through an inter bank automated teller system  safe deposit and night depository facilities and internet banking services  including on line bill paying 
the company continues to focus its efforts in further development of retail products and services 
niche marketing 
an important component of our business strategy is the development of business lines that give us higher margin opportunities 
we are continually assessing the markets within which we operate in order to identify and seize upon opportunities where we believe a market segment is being under served 
once identified  we focus on customizing solutions that are beneficial to the user and profitable to us 
an example is our manufacturing group 
the manufacturing group is a unique lending group whose focus is on assisting manufacturing firms in solving industry specific challenges 
the manufacturing group is comprised of specialized teams of experienced bankers who have industry specific training or experience and can offer an array of resources to time challenged business owners  through the manufacturing group s solutions networktm a database of national penn professionals and other selected third party resource providers who assist with financial and non financial business challenges 
value added areas include industry specific seminars  newsletters  websites and a board of advisors that provides feedback and support to the group 
at december   the manufacturing group managed relationships with loans outstanding of approximately million 
another example is our leasing company 
national penn leasing company provides equipment lease financing 
it has been in business since december and had total leases outstanding of million as of december  other examples are our international banking group and our government banking group 
the international banking group provides for customer import  export and general documentary credit  foreign exchange and international payment needs 
as of december  the unit managed a letter of credit portfolio totaling million 
the international banking group has been in operation since june our government banking group  formed in  serves the unique banking needs of local government entities such as school districts  municipalities and townships 
at december   our government banking group deposits totaled million 
development of fee income 
in addition to generation of fee income through our commercial banking operations including mortgage lending  we have a number of specialized investment and insurance subsidiaries to develop fee income and to serve specific markets 
we currently provide trust and investment management services through national penn investors trust company  our national trust company subsidiary  and effective january   christiana 
we also provide investment management services through national penn capital advisors  inc and vantage investment advisors  llc 
securities brokerage services are currently provided by a third party vendor  primevest financial services  inc  under the names national penn investment services and effective february   knbt investment services 
in total  our wealth management group currently manages and or advises approximately billion for over  individual and corporate accounts 
we currently provide insurance services primarily property and casualty insurance through national penn insurance agency  inc we also offer specialized insurance services through caruso benefits group  inc and higgins insurance associates  each acquired in the february merger with knbt 
the insurance group currently serves over  customers 
for the year ended december   our efforts produced total fee income for the company of million compared to million for the year ended december  enhanced customer service 
our business strategy is supported by a strong delivery system that places greater emphasis on customer service 
we have segmented our market into regions based primarily on geographic considerations 
each region is managed by a region president who reports to a designated executive officer 
this officer coordinates our sales and servicing efforts in order to effectively serve our current customers and gain new customers 
the purpose of this initiative is to better leverage our centralized marketing and servicing efforts  thereby increasing sales of the wide range of products and services that we offer 
we believe that this cross functional approach leads to more responsive service for our customers who  in turn  reward us with more of their total financial services business 
general development of business national penn bank  then known as national bank of boyertown  was originally chartered in national bank of boyertown converted to a holding company structure in by forming national penn bancshares  inc as a parent company to the bank

we also began the planning process for consolidating the businesses of our wealth management subsidiaries  investors trust company and firstservice capital  inc  together with the trust business of the peoples bank of oxford  into a national penn branded entity 
in connection with this reorganization  we filed an application with the occ to convert the charter of investors trust company to a limited purpose national trust company to be named national penn investors trust company

nittany financial also had million under management at december  through its subsidiaries  vantage investment advisors  llc and nittany asset management  inc this acquisition resulted in our entry into a strong market in central pennsylvania  and strengthened our overall wealth management business 
on april   we acquired resources for retirement  inc  now a part of our national penn capital advisors  inc subsidiary 
the acquisition of resources  a retirement plan advisory firm based in newtown  pa  has enabled us to significantly expand our k business to larger companies

lending underwriting and credit administration the board of directors  through the director s enterprise risk management committee dermc  oversees our lending practices and policies 
our policies require that loans meet sound underwriting criteria 
the dermc approves loan authority for certain officers to be used individually or jointly and for the loan committee of national penn bank 
the largest single name lending authority within national penn bank is  christiana utilizes only joint authority with a maximum approval level of  any loan request for an amount exceeding individual or joint approval authority levels must be approved by national penn bank s loan committee 
the national penn bank loan committee is chaired by hugh marshall  chief credit officer  with other executive and senior officers of the company making up the balance of the loan committee 
the loan committee considers loan requests of million up to the bank s single borrower lending limit 
national penn bank originates loans through direct solicitation of the borrower  referral sources  through loan participations with other banks  loan brokers  equipment vendors  and purchases some leases through other financial institutions 
as part of our credit administration process  we have an asset quality review performed by an outside consulting firm 
their review consists of sampling the commercial business and commercial real estate portfolio  reviewing individual borrower files for adherence to policy and underwriting standards  proper loan administration  and asset quality 
national penn bank s chairman  national penn bank s ceo  and other senior lending and credit administration personnel meet monthly to review delinquencies  non performing assets  classified assets and other relevant information to evaluate credit risk within this portfolio 
loan portfolio at december  and  our portfolio was composed of the following loan types december  december  dollars in thousands percentage of portfolio percentage of portfolio commercial real estate commercial properties residential subdivision multifamily commercial business loans commercial term loans mortgages lines of credit leases consumer loans residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit other loans total loans commercial lending general a majority of national penn bank s loan assets are loans to business owners of many types 
national penn bank makes commercial loans for real estate development  equipment financing  account receivables and inventory financing and other purposes as required by the broad spectrum of borrowers 
commercial loans by their nature carry higher risk than loans to consumers 
the changes in commercial borrowers financial condition and cash flow plus the potential volatility in the value of collateral held makes commercial lending a higher risk form of lending 
consequently  a greater percentage of national penn bank s resources and the staff s time are devoted to monitoring this area of the portfolio 
national penn bank s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans 
typically  loans will be limited to of real estate values  of new equipment  against eligible accounts receivable and or less against finished inventory or raw material 
individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower and or the term of the loan 
below are different loan types and descriptions offered to national penn bank s commercial loan customers 
commercial real estate commercial properties these loans include both construction loans and long term loans financing commercial properties such as office buildings  retail strip malls  and medical office buildings

commercial business loans loans in this general category are made to proprietors  professionals  partnerships and corporations

the assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation 
commercial term loans and mortgages these loans are typically used to finance the equipment and the owner occupied real estate needs of the borrower 
terms will range from to years dependent upon the economic life of the asset financed 
interest rates will be either floating or fixed for periods up to years 
many loans  although written with extended amortizations  will actually require balloon payments at   or years 
commercial lines of credit as of december   national penn bank had lines of credit representing billion in commitments to business owners 
the lines finance short term working capital needs of the borrower including funds for accounts receivable  inventory  short term equipment needs and operating expenses 
lines of credit allow the business owner to borrow  repay  and re borrow funds on an as needed basis up to a pre determined maximum level 
lines of credit are typically committed for one year but may be granted for longer terms based on the financial strength of the borrower and the collateral provided 
typical collateral for a line of credit will consist of the borrower s accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment 
sometimes the collateral will include the business real estate or the business owner s personal residence 
repayment of the line is dependent upon the ongoing success of the business and the conversions of assets  such as accounts receivable and inventory  to cash 
interest rates are usually floating and are generally based on wall street journal prime rate  or the day london inter bank offered rate libor 
small business loans national penn bank is a preferred lender as designated by the us small business administration sba

the amount of the guaranty can range from to of the loan amount dependent on the form of the loan 
sba guaranteed loans may be used to finance equipment  owner occupied business real estate  accounts receivables and inventory 
the term of sba loans can range from a few months up to years dependent upon the purpose and collateral offered 
sba regulations limit interest rates and terms 
in calendar year national penn bank originated million sba guaranteed loans compared to million originated in the bank actively sells the guaranteed portion of these loans in the secondary market

nplc provides leases for many types of equipment  serving the manufacturing  service  transportation  and construction sectors 
leases are written at fixed rates for to year terms based on the economic life of the underlying equipment 
leases can be capital leases  operating leases  conditional sales contracts or other lease structures dependent on the financial condition and needs of the lessee as well as the type of equipment involved 
nplc started business in december and at december   had total leases outstanding of million 
consumer lending general national penn bank provides loans to consumers to finance personal residences  automobiles  college tuition  home improvements and other personal needs 
during  national penn bank originated first lien residential mortgages principally in eastern and central pennsylvania 
originations in totaled million 
all residential mortgages are sold to secondary market investors or held within national penn bank s investment or loan portfolios 
at year end  the residential mortgages held in national penn bank s loan portfolio totaled million compared to million as of december  national penn bank also provides home equity loans  home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans through its network of community offices and private banking division 
the majority of national penn bank s consumer loans are secured by the borrower s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position 
national penn bank requires a loan to value ratio of not greater than on this portfolio with some exceptions based on the borrower s financial strength 
national penn bank originates all of its home equity loans and home equity lines of credit directly with its customers 
at december   npb had consumer loan outstandings of million compared to million at december  investment policies and strategies the investment portfolio includes the national penn bank portfolio and the national penn investment company portfolio 
the national penn bank portfolio totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the investment company portfolio was million at december  and million at december  at december   national penn investors trust company had a small investment portfolio of million as a vehicle to invest its capital 
national penn bank s investment portfolio consists primarily of agency and municipal bonds 
the agency bonds include debentures as well as mortgage backed securities issued by gmna  fnma and fhlmc 
agency and municipal bonds carry low risk based capital requirements 
in addition to following our strategy of growing the agency and municipal bond portfolio  provided an opportunity to add other high yielding securities consistent with our risk reward profile 
collateralized debt obligations cdos were purchased in  backed by credit default swaps and bank and insurance trust preferred debt  to help mitigate margin compression and grow our investment portfolio according to internal budget expectations 
on december   national penn bank owned million of cdos 
these cdos are all investment grade securities  with yields higher than that of agency or municipal bonds 
the primary purpose of the national penn bank investment portfolio is to provide a secondary source of liquidity 
another purpose is to provide a source of income 
for liquidity purposes  we concentrate on buying high quality  highly marketable securities 
we also construct the portfolio to provide a steady cash flow stream 
a high percentage of the national penn bank investment portfolio supports our funding pledging needs that is  we must pledge qualifying assets to secure deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities 
in addition to the factors discussed  we follow a strategy of shortening the duration of the bank portfolio when rates are low and lengthening the duration of the investment portfolio when rates are high 
in we continued our strategy established in later of purchasing long term securities 
whether we are buying shorter term securities during low rate cycles  or longer term securities during times of higher rates  we consider the impact of the investment portfolio in the company s overall interest rate risk position 
we therefore might adjust the strategy  due to our need to remain consistent with our interest rate risk corporate guidelines 
in and  we pooled million and million  respectively  of our own production of ten and fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans and converted the loans to fhlmc securities in order to transfer assets to the investment portfolio 
this is a more price efficient way to add mortgage backed securities to our portfolio as compared to purchasing mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
these loans  when securitized  are more liquid and also support our deposit pledging needs 
there were no securitizations in national penn investment company s portfolio consists primarily of investments in regional or community banking organizations 
these investments are in the form of common stock or trust preferred securities 
the primary purpose of this portfolio is to generate income  including both current income in the form of interest and dividends  as well as long term capital gains 
our strategy in the trust preferred portfolio is to invest in other banks where we can understand the financial performance and risks involved  while enjoying a higher return 
these investments require the same risk based capital as commercial loans  but the overall dollar amount of this portfolio  at million  is relatively small so the impact on capital is not material 
operating segments at december   national penn has one reportable segment  community banking  and certain other non reportable segments  as described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
footnote includes segment information on revenue  assets and income  and is incorporated by reference in this item potential subprime exposure national penn bank s direct exposure to subprime mortgages was negligible as of december  the origination of subprime mortgages has historically represented a small fraction of national penn s total mortgage loan originations 
national penn may have indirect exposure to the subprime mortgage market through its many banking relationships with commercial real estate developers and with a portion of its investment portfolio 
the contraction in subprime credit availability may limit our borrowers ability to obtain customers able to secure the necessary financing  adversely affecting real estate sales and our borrowers liquidity and ability to repay debt 
bank and insurance trust preferred debt held in our investment portfolio contains portfolio names that may have direct subprime exposure 
products and services with reputation risk national penn and its subsidiaries offer a diverse range of financial and banking products and services 
in the event one or more customers and or governmental agencies become dissatisfied or objects to any product or service offered by national penn or any of its subsidiaries  negative publicity with respect to any such product or service  whether legally justified or not  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
the discontinuance of any product or service  whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
future acquisitions our acquisition strategy consists of identifying financial service companies  including banks  insurance agencies and investment advisers  with business philosophies that are similar to ours  which operate in strong markets  and which can be acquired at an acceptable cost 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we generally consider potential revenue enhancements and operating efficiencies  asset quality  interest rate risk  and management capabilities 
discussions with acquisition candidates take place frequently 
concentrations  seasonality we do not have any portion of our businesses dependent on a single or limited number of customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no substantial portion of investments are concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries 
the company s commercial loan portfolio has a concentration in loans to commercial real estate investors and developers and a significant amount of loans are secured by real estate located in southeastern pennsylvania 
see also significant concentrations of credit risk in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
while our businesses are not seasonal in nature  we experience some fluctuation in our deposits due to the seasonality of government and school district deposits 
see liquidity and interest rate sensitivity in item of this report

the bhca further prohibits national penn from engaging in or from acquiring ownership or control of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock of any company engaged in a non banking business unless such business is determined by the federal reserve  by regulation or by order  to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the bhca does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of such non banking related businesses 
the federal reserve s regulations concerning permissible non banking activities for national penn provide fourteen categories of functionally related activities that are permissible non banking activities 
these are extending credit and servicing loans 
certain activities related to extending credit 
leasing personal or real property under certain conditions 
operating non bank depository institutions  including savings associations

dividend restrictions national penn is a legal entity separate and distinct from national penn bank and national penn s other direct and indirect bank and non bank subsidiaries 
national penn s revenues on a parent company only basis result almost entirely from dividends paid to national penn by its subsidiaries 
the right of national penn  and consequently the right of creditors and shareholders of national penn  to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary including depositors  in the case of national penn bank and christiana bank trust company christiana  except to the extent that claims of national penn in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized 
federal and state laws regulate the payment of dividends by national penn s subsidiaries 
see supervision and regulation regulation of national penn bank and christiana in this item see also footnote to the consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
further  it is the policy of the federal reserve that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings 
federal banking regulators also have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
capital adequacy bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines 
capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
capital adequacy guidelines are intended to ensure that bank holding companies have adequate capital given the risk levels of its assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the guidelines require that bank holding companies maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a bank holding company s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories and its capital is classified in one of three tiers 
the required minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital must be tier capital 
tier capital consists principally of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the remainder of total capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt  qualifying preferred stock and loan loss allowance tier capital 
at december   national penn s tier capital and total tier and tier combined capital ratios were and  respectively 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio 
this requires a minimum level of tier capital as determined under the risk based capital rules to average total consolidated assets of for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
the federal reserve expects all other bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
at december   national penn s leverage ratio was 
the federal reserve has also indicated that it will consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the federal reserve has not advised national penn of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to national penn 
the fdia requires an insured institution to take prompt corrective action in the event minimum capital requirements are not met 
pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia  the federal banking agencies have specified  by regulation  the levels at which an insured institution is considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 
under these regulations  an institution is considered well capitalized if it satisfies each of the following requirements it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more 
it has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more 
it has a leverage ratio of or more 
it is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
at december   national penn bank qualified as well capitalized under these regulatory standards 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
fdic insurance assessments national penn bank and christiana are each subject to deposit insurance assessments by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the assessments are based on the risk classification of the depository institutions 
national penn bank and christiana were each required to pay subject to certain credits regular fdic insurance assessments in  and expect to be required to pay regular insurance assessments to the fdic in as part of a regulatory recapitalization in  fdic insured deposits are now assessed to fund debt service on the federal government s related bond payments

the operations of national penn bank are also subject to regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  the federal reserve  and the fdic 
the operations of christiana are subject to regulations of the state bank commissioner of the state of delaware and the fdic 
the occ and fdic  which have primary supervisory authority over national penn bank and christiana  respectively  regularly examine banks in such areas as reserves  loans  investments  management practices  trust  and other aspects of operations 
these examinations are designed for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders 
each bank must furnish annual and quarterly reports to the primary regulator  each of which has the legal authority to prevent the bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern  among other things  the scope of a bank s business  the investments a bank may make  the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain  the types and terms of loans a bank may make and the collateral it may take  the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations  and the establishment of branches  including community offices 
pennsylvania law and delaware law each permit statewide branching 
under the national bank act  national penn bank is required to obtain the prior approval of the occ for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by it in one year would exceed its net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  national penn bank may only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed statutory bad debts 
under the fdia  national penn bank is prohibited from paying any dividends  making other distributions or paying any management fees if  after such payment  it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements 
christiana is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to national penn 
currently  christiana may pay dividends to the extent of its accumulated retained earnings 
as subsidiary banks of a bank holding company  national penn bank and christiana are each subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  and on taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans 
the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulations also place certain limitations and reporting requirements on extensions of credit by a bank to the principal shareholders of its parent holding company  among others  and to related interests of such principal shareholders 
in addition  such legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a principal shareholder of a holding company may obtain credit from banks with which the subsidiary bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
regulation of other subsidiaries national penn s direct non bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
in july  national penn converted investors trust company from a state chartered trust company regulated by the federal reserve and the pennsylvania department of banking to a limited purpose national trust company regulated by the occ 
national penn bank s other direct non bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the occ 
in addition  national penn capital advisors  inc and vantage investment advisors  llc  investment advisory firms  are each subject to regulation by the sec and various state securities regulators 
national penn bank s insurance agency subsidiaries  including those acquired in the knbt merger  are also subject to regulation by the pennsylvania department of insurance 
monetary and fiscal policies the financial services industry  including national penn and its subsidiaries  is affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of government agencies  including the federal reserve 
through open market securities transactions and changes in its discount rate and reserve requirements  the federal reserve exerts considerable influence over the cost and availability of funds for lending and investment 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks now to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company an fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become an fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
although national penn believes that it is eligible to do so  national penn has not elected to become a financial holding company 
national penn has  instead  continued to utilize the continuing authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 
glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as an fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the newly authorized activities 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for an fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
usa patriot act in recent years  a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been the combating of money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers and increased information sharing 
it also substantially broadened the scope of federal anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence policies  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued a number of regulations to implement various provisions of the patriot act 
these regulations impose obligations on national penn to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of its customers 
failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on national penn s business

risk factors variations in interest rates may negatively affect national penn s financial performance 
changes in interest rates may reduce profits 
the primary source of income for national penn is the differential  or the net interest spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
as prevailing interest rates change  net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re pricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to repay their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect national penn s net interest spread  loan origination volume  asset quality and overall profitability 
capital market conditions may affect national penn s liquidity and market value of assets 
ratings agencies have recently downgraded the ratings of various municipal bond insurers 
these downgrades reflect the perceived reduced ability of the bond insurers to fulfill their guarantee obligations for the bonds they insure  as perceived by the ratings agencies 
the market value of municipal bonds in national penn s investment portfolio may be affected by the downgrades of the credit ratings of these bond insurers  notwithstanding the underlying performance of the issuers of the bonds themselves 
this could result in changes in asset values that could reduce national penn s profits or liquidity 
in a similar vein  conditions in the capital markets have been affected by the turmoil in sub prime debt 
there has been a spillover effect of this turmoil into other asset classes  notwithstanding the underlying performance of those asset classes 
the market value of national penn s investments may be affected by these conditions  resulting in changes in asset values that could reduce national penn s profits or liquidity 
national penn may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of recent transactions 
national penn s success depends on  among other things  national penn s ability to realize anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from the christiana and knbt mergers and to combine the businesses of national penn  christiana and knbt in a manner that permits growth without materially disrupting existing customer relationships or resulting in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers 
if national penn is not able to successfully achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of the christiana and knbt acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
until the completion of the respective acquisitions  national penn  christiana and knbt operated as independent entities 
the integration process now underway includes the relocation or reorganization of systems  personnel  business units and operations  as well as systems conversion and integration  and will continue throughout  with success dependent  at least in part  on the efforts of key employees and third party vendors 
if not successfully managed  the integration effort could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of national penn s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  and policies that adversely affect national penn s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the christiana and knbt acquisitions 
governmental regulation and legislation could limit national penn s future growth 
national penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of the operations of national penn and its subsidiaries 
these laws  which are primarily intended for the protection of consumers  depositors and the government s deposit insurance funds  may change from time to time 
national penn cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or in their interpretations would have on national penn 
any such changes may negatively affect national penn s ability to expand its products and services and to increase the value of its business and  as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to regulatory limits 
national penn is a bank holding company 
its operations are conducted by direct and indirect subsidiaries  each of which is a separate and distinct legal entity 
substantially all of national penn s assets are held by its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
its principal bank subsidiary  national penn bank  which includes national penn bank s firstservice bank  hometowne heritage bank  nittany bank  and knbt bank divisions  is national penn s primary source of dividends 
dividend payments from national penn bank and christiana are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by bank regulatory agencies 
the ability of national penn bank and christiana to pay dividends is also subject to profitability  financial condition  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
at december   approximately million was available without the need for regulatory approval for the payment of dividends to national penn from national penn bank 
there is no assurance that national penn bank  christiana and or national penn s other subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that national penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future 
national penn s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock 
national penn s future acquisitions could dilute ownership of national penn and may cause national penn to become more susceptible to adverse economic events 
national penn has used its common stock to acquire other companies in the past and intends to acquire or make investments in banks and other complementary businesses with its common stock in the future 
national penn may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions  which would dilute the ownership interest of national penn s shareholders upon closing 
future business acquisitions could be material to national penn  and any failure to integrate these businesses into national penn could have a material adverse effect on the value of national penn common stock 
in addition  any such acquisition could require national penn to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt 
in those events  national penn could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect national penn s profitability 
national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
some of national penn s competitors are extremely aggressive in loan pricing and structures they offer in their efforts to build market share 
this competition could reduce national penn s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that national penn s subsidiaries originate and the interest rates they may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than national penn  which could decrease the deposits that national penn attracts or require national penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect national penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  national penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase national penn s cost of funds 
national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of national penn s non bank competitors are subject to less extensive regulations than those governing national penn s banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries in providing financial products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit national penn s margins on banking and non banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
national penn s subsidiaries face intense competition with various other financial institutions for the attraction and retention of key personnel  specifically those who generate and maintain national penn s customer relationships 
these competitors may offer greater compensation and other benefits  which could result in the loss of potential and or existing key personnel  including the loss of potential and or existing substantial customer relationships

legislation or regulatory changes  including without limitation  changes in laws or regulations on competition  industry consolidation  development of competing financial products and services  changes in accounting rules and practices  changes in or additional customer privacy and data protection requirements  and intensified regulatory scrutiny of national penn and the financial services industry in general  may adversely affect national penn s costs and business 
market volatility may continue in the securities markets  with an adverse effect on national penn s securities and asset management activities 
in the current environment of increased investor activism  including hedge fund investment policies and practices  shareholder concerns or actions due to stock price changes of financial service companies  may require increased management board attention  efforts and commitments  deferring or decreasing the focus on business development and operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance of the company and financial condition of the company as of december   with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
accordingly  this discussion and analysis does not include a discussion of the earnings performance or financial condition of either christiana bank trust company christiana  acquired by the company on january   or of knbt bancorp  inc knbt  acquired by the company on february  current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements as of december   included in this report at item the company s strategic plan provides for a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the acquisition of christiana and knbt in the first quarter of are similar strategic initiatives 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
continued interest margin compression makes asset growth a priority  as well as the development of fee income 
the company s goal is for asset growth each year to be generated through a combination of internal growth and growth by mergers and acquisitions 
in  substantially all of the company s asset growth was internally generated 
the acquisitions further support that goal 
both enable the company to expand its customer base into new territory and further grow its wealth management operations

risk factors  which is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practice within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and the assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
in this testing  the company employs general industry practices in accordance with gaap 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit using various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of june each year  and again at any quarter end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
through its annual analysis as of june   the company has not identified any impairment of its goodwill 
no events occurred during third or fourth quarter necessitating a re test of goodwill impairment 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
as of january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  using the modified retrospective method 
fas r requires that the company measure and recognize compensation expense for share based compensation  based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant under the company s share based compensation plans is estimated using the black sholes option pricing model based on various estimates and assumptions  including expected volatility  expected dividends  expected terms  expected forfeitures and the risk free rates associated with the awards 
all of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods 
the company has not substantially changed any aspect of its overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques utilized as compared to previous years

national penn s management uses this non gaap measure in its analysis of the company s performance 
this non gaap financial measure  annualized net income return on average tangible equity  excludes the average balance of acquisition related goodwill and intangibles in determining average tangible shareholders equity 
banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and intangibles from shareholders equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution 
management believes the presentation of this financial measure excluding the impact of these items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of national penn  as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing the company s tangible capital 
this disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with gaap  nor is it necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies

interest expense in increased million or to million from the amount of million due to an increase in interest on deposits of million  an increase in interest on long term borrowings of million  and an increase in expense for securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds sold of  the increase in interest expense on deposits is due primarily to an increase in the volume of interest bearing deposits and the average rate paid on these deposits in the increase in interest expense on borrowings is a result of an increase in the average balance of borrowings outstanding during and an increase in the average rate on borrowings in the long term borrowings category 
the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and community office overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase related to higher outstanding balances and that due to the levels and volatility of interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate  and changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by new volume

allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan charge offs increased to million in  compared to net loan charge offs of million in and million in management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the current portfolio 
a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended december   is shown below dollars in thousands december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial and industrial loans and leases real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries commercial and industrial real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to expense acquired in acquisitions balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances  if any  which are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
the level of non performing assets  including loans over days delinquent 
levels of allowance for specific classified assets 
a review of portfolio concentration of any type  either customer  industry loan type  collateral or risk grade 
the company also maintains an allowance for losses on commitments to extend credit  which is included in other liabilities and is computed using information similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses  modified to take into account the probability of drawdown on the commitment as well as inherent risk factors on those commitments 
the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans and leases that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans and leases in each category as well as historical trends

the increase in wealth management income is primarily attributable to income from vantage investment advisors  llc  acquired as part of the nittany acquisition in january  but also to income contributed by resources for retirement  inc  acquired in april  and income throughout this year from trust and third party investment services 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily due to collection on a larger deposit base as a result of the nittany acquisition 
mortgage banking income declined million as compared to as a result of the general cooling of the residential mortgage lending environment

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
during the past year  liquidity has tightened as loan demand has improved and competition for deposits has intensified 
these factors have combined to cause an increased use of wholesale funding 
wholesale funding is defined here as funding sources outside our core deposit base  such as the national jumbo cd market  correspondent bank borrowings  or brokered cds 
at the present time  we have adequate availability of wholesale funding 
regardless of our comfort with our liquidity position at present time  we actively monitor our position and any increased use of wholesale funding increases our attention in this area 
the company s main liquidity concern is that as the economy and consequently the equity market strengthens  the company may suffer an outflow of funds as depositors withdraw cash for re investment in improving equity markets disintermediation 
the company has sought to prepare for this potential by working to build its share of customers banking business on the theory that even if some funds move back to the equity market  the company will still retain a larger share than it had three years ago  growing its government banking unit  reviewing its deposit product offerings  establishing additional non core sources of funding  maintaining a more liquid investment portfolio  and continuing to develop its capability to securitize assets

accordingly  in each case  the company expects no material run off of deposits over the long term and as a result  does not anticipate a negative material impact on the company s overall long term liquidity position 
the goal of interest rate sensitivity management is to avoid fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
such sensitivity is measured as the difference in the volume of assets and liabilities in the existing portfolio that are subject to repricing in a future time period 
the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  in thousands re pricing periods within three months three months through one year one year through five years over five years assets interest bearing deposits at banks federal funds sold investment securities loans and leases other assets liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt other liabilities shareholders equity total interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the most recent calendar quarter 
the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will re price at contractual re pricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for re pricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered re priceable within three months and are considered re priceable in the over five year category 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling rate environment and would decrease in a rising rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
the company uses financial simulation models to measure interest rate exposure 
these tools provide management with extensive information on the potential impact of net income caused by changes in interest rates 
interest rate related risks such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts  prepayments and other option risks are considered 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows dollars in thousands mvpe change in interest rate amount change basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points management also estimates the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net income 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect that a parallel interest rate shift would have on the company s net income dollars in thousands december  december  change in interest rates change in net income change in net income change in net income change in net income in basis points the company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset liability committee alco approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging 
the derivatives employed by the company currently include forward sales of mortgage commitments 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading purposes 
at the current level of interest rates  the company has some exposure to a movement in rising rates due to the amount of repriceable liabilities in the short term and the optionality of the financial instruments on both sides of the balance sheet 
optionality exists because customers have choices regarding their deposit accounts or loans 
for example  if a customer has a fixed rate mortgage  he she may choose to refinance the mortgage if interest rates decline 
one way to reduce this option risk is to sell the company s long term fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market 
the impact of a rising or falling interest rate environment on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
nonetheless  the company s asset liability management committee s priority is to manage this optionality and therefore limit the level of interest rate risk 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  in thousands total less than one year one to three years four to five years after five years minimum annual rentals on non cancelable operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits loan commitments long term borrowed funds guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures letters of credit total the company had no capital leases at december  capital adequacy the following table sets forth certain capital performance ratios for the company

future outlook the company s market area  while diverse  is subject to many of the same economic forces being experienced regionally and nationally the general economy will likely generate modest loan growth in in the mid single digit percentages 
the principal challenge faced by the company today is to grow our earnings in light of the compression of our net interest margin due to current and anticipated interest rate levels 
in this environment  we seek to increase our net interest income principally through increased volume  including volume from mergers and acquisitions  to increase our non interest income  especially revenues from insurance and wealth management activities  and to contain our costs 
the company  like many of its peers  continues to be concerned about current and near term uncertain economic conditions and their effect on its loan volume as well as its overall credit quality
