item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
restatement of financial statements on april   we announced the audit committee was conducting an independent review of certain contracts with customers and the recognition of revenue that the company had previously recognized in regarding those contracts 
upon concluding its investigation and after consultation with and upon the recommendation of management and the company s independent registered accounting firm  the audit committee determined that revenue for certain of our customer contracts was recognized earlier than it should have been and that the financial statements for the affected periods should be restated 
on may   we also announced that the audit committee had determined that our previously issued financial statements for the interim periods contained in the quarterly reports on form q filed with respect to each of the quarterly periods ended june and september  should not be relied upon 
on june   we filed amendments to our quarterly reports for the fiscal quarters ended june and september  to restate the financial statements and related disclosures therein 
the net effect at december  was to reduce and defer previously recognized revenue and gross profit of  and  respectively 
the restatement affected our previously reported financial results for the quarters ended june  and september  as follows three months ended june  six months ended june  unaudited unaudited as reported adjustment as restated as reported adjustment as restated revenue income loss from operations net loss net loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted net loss attributable to common shareholders per common share three months ended september  nine months ended september  unaudited unaudited as reported adjustment as restated as reported adjustment as restated revenue loss from operations net loss net loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted net loss attributable to common shareholders per common share under the company s revenue recognition practice  revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the period during which the company is obligated to deliver support  which is usually a month period 
for accounts and  the company previously recognized  and  respectively in revenue for post contract support in the third quarter 
the revenue that was incorrectly recognized during these periods will be recognized on a cash basis when and if collected 
since december   we have incurred legal and accounting and other costs related to the audit committee review and restatement of our financial statements described in this report under the caption explanatory note  of approximately  as of may   of which approximately  was expensed the first quarter of and an additional  will be expensed in the second quarter of these costs are expensed in the period in which the legal  accounting and other services are provided and are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
these costs will have a material adverse effect on our net loss for the period in which they are expensed and on our liquidity for the period in which they are paid 
we anticipate that we will incur additional legal  accounting and other fees related to the audit committee review and restatement 
we also will incur other fees and costs related to the execution of the remediation plan adopted by us after the conclusion of the audit committee review 
at this time  we cannot estimate the amount of additional legal  accounting and other fees and costs that may be incurred in the second quarter of and beyond to execute this remediation plan 
the company believes it continues to have sufficient cash and other resources available to meet working capital and other needs that might arise over the next twelve months 
audit committee review on may   the audit committee determined that the financial statements in the company s quarterly reports on form q for the three months ended june and september   should no longer be relied upon 
the audit committee reached this determination based on its review of the company s sales to five accounts and its conclusion that the company s revenue recognition as to four of those accounts did not comply with applicable accounting principles 
one account of   for software and  for post contract support  of which  was recognized in the third quarter of  which represented approximately of the previously reported revenues for that quarter account  a second account of   for software and  for post contract support  of which  was recognized in the third quarter of  which represented approximately of the previously reported revenues for that quarter account  a third account of   for software and  for post contract support  of which  was recognized in the second quarter of  which represented approximately of the previously reported revenues for that quarter account  and a fourth account of   for software and  for post contract support  of which  was recognized in the second quarter of  which represented approximately of the previously reported revenues for that quarter account 
with respect to the fifth account account reviewed by the audit committee  the company established a bad debt reserve in the third quarter of in the amount of  which reflects an estimate of the uncollectibility of certain revenues that had previously been recognized in the first three quarters in the company has restated its previously issued financial statements for the three and six months ended june   in amendment no 
to its quarterly report on form q for quarterly period ended june   to correct the incorrect recognition of revenue in the period relating to account and account the company also restated its previously issued financial statements for the three and nine months ended september  in amendment no 
to its quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended september   to correct the incorrect recognition of revenue in the period relating to account and account  as well as the incorrect recognition in the period of an additional  because the company did not have sufficient evidence to establish the creditworthiness of the customer and the establishment of a bad debt reserve relating to account pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab one element of revenue recognition is consideration of whether the collectibility of sales revenue is reasonably assured ie  whether the purchaser is creditworthy with respect to that transaction 
during the year end audit process  management learned that the creditworthiness of account and account  both of which were european customers  had been assessed  and approximately  in revenue had been recognized in the third quarter  based upon falsified documentation that the company received 
the company learned of the falsified documentation when the sales representative the sales representative responsible for accounts  and  and who was also involved with account  who was employed by a european outsourcing company that the company initially retained in and to whom the company paid commissions in connection with accounts   and  but whom we terminated in april as a result of this review admitted to the company s executive vice president  legal and business affairs  to falsifying documentation purporting to establish the creditworthiness of account the documentation purporting to establish the creditworthiness of account was subsequently determined to be false  although the identity of the person or persons responsible for falsifying such documentation was not ascertained during the audit committee review 
after determining that the documentation purporting to support the creditworthiness of accounts and was false  management informed the audit committee  which then commenced its review 
the audit committee s review focused exclusively on the following issues whether the false documentation identified with respect to accounts and was limited to those accounts  or whether it affected other accounts that were either affiliated with the sales representative or were deemed by management to be material to the quarter in in which revenue for those accounts had been recognized accounts  and  whether the sales representative falsified documentation for his own financial benefit and or at the direction  or with the knowledge  of management  and whether information obtained during the review indicated that accounts and were not legitimate transactions 
the audit committee conducted its review of accounts through with the assistance of latham watkins llp and fti consulting  and with the support and cooperation of management and personnel 
the review was conducted over a period of approximately six weeks  and included collection and review of more than two million pages of documents  as well as interviews of eight members of management and sales force teams in the united states and the sales representative in europe 
with respect to account  with which the company had no previous business relationship  the audit committee found that the company paid a sales commission to the european outsourcing company upon execution of the contract with account  and that the sales representative received a commission from the outsourcing company in connection with account  but found no evidence that the commission was affected by the sales representative s falsification of documentation concerning the creditworthiness of account although the audit committee found no evidence that the sales representative acted at the direction  or with the knowledge  of any member of management in falsifying documentation concerning the creditworthiness of account  it found that the sales representative had been directed by senior management to obtain evidence of the creditworthiness of account so that revenue could be recognized in the third quarter of the audit committee also found that senior management did not adequately instruct the sales representative regarding and the company did not have a practice or policy regarding the types of information that could be used in making a creditworthiness determination pursuant to the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles 
in addition  the audit committee determined that  although sales revenue from account was recognized in the third quarter of  evidence relating to creditworthiness was not obtained until the fourth quarter of  however  prior to the filing of the third quarter form q 
the audit committee concluded that the sales revenue of  from account  which was previously recognized in the third quarter of  did not constitute a sale for which revenue could be recognized  and therefore no revenue should have been recognized in the third quarter of or any other period 
with respect to account  with which the company had no previous business relationship  the audit committee has been unable to determine the identity of the person or persons who falsified documentation concerning the creditworthiness of account although the audit committee has found no evidence establishing that management directed or had knowledge of the falsification of any document  it has found that the sales representative had been directed by senior management to obtain evidence of the creditworthiness of account so that revenue could be recognized in the third quarter of the audit committee determined that  although sales revenue from account was recognized in the third quarter of  evidence relating to creditworthiness was not obtained until the fourth quarter  however  prior to the filing of the third quarter form q 
the audit committee also found that senior management did not adequately instruct the sales representative regarding and the company did not have a policy or practice regarding the types of information that could be used in making a creditworthiness determination pursuant to the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles 
the audit committee has concluded that the sales revenue of  from account  which was previously recognized in the third quarter of  did not constitute a sale for which revenue could be recognized  and therefore no revenue should have been recognized in the third quarter of or any other period 
the revenue will be recognized on a cash basis when and if collected 
with respect to accounts and  with which the company did not have previous business relationships  the audit committee did not find evidence of falsified documentation 
the audit committee determined that the company did not have sufficient evidence to establish the creditworthiness of accounts or when it recognized  and  respectively  in revenue in the second quarter  and that the company did not have a practice or policy regarding the types of information that could be used in making such creditworthiness determinations 
neither account nor has acknowledged its contract to the company s independent registered public accountants  and there is evidence that account disputes the terms of its contract with the company 
account has made no payments to the company 
account has paid a portion of its outstanding receivable  which is now current 
the audit committee concluded that the sales revenue of  from accounts and was untimely recognized in the second quarter of account was determined not to constitute a sale for which revenue could be recognized in any period 
the  of revenue from account was reclassified to deferred revenue in the second quarter of and revenue will be recognized as the payments are received 
the company received payments of  in the fourth quarter of and  in the first quarter of the balance is not yet due 
additionally  the company reversed  of support revenue associated with accounts and in the third quarter of with respect to account  with which the company had a prior business relationship  the audit committee did not find evidence of falsified documentation 
the audit committee found that the creditworthiness of account was based on the past credit payment history with the company 
it also found that  when payments associated with account became past due in  the company continued selling to account without re assessing its creditworthiness until september  when the account was significantly past due 
further sales were suspended in the fourth quarter of the audit committee concurred with management s recommendation that a bad debt reserve of  should be taken in the fourth quarter of in connection with its sales to account upon further examination of the facts and circumstances involved in account  the company confirmed that sales had occurred to account  that a reserve for  was required  but that the reserve should have been established in the third quarter  rather than the fourth quarter  of to establish that reserve  the company recorded a general charge to general and administrative expense of  which increased the company s net loss for the third quarter of by that amount in addition to the  of revenue that was reversed in the period 
the establishment of the reserve also resulted in a reduction in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts on the company s balance sheet at september   by the same amount 
in addition  during the preparation of the company s annual financial statements and prior to discovery of the falsified documentation mentioned above  management determined that revenue of  had been incorrectly recognized in the third quarter of because of insufficient evidence to establish the creditworthiness of the customer 
management also conducted a review of the company s sales to all accounts for which revenue was recognized in fiscal  including the accounts of hantro products oy  which the company acquired in november  for the purposes of determining that the criteria set forth in sop and sab were satisfied and that revenue was properly recognized for each account 
management concluded that  except for the accounts discussed above and the  that also was incorrectly recognized  the criteria set forth in sop and sab were satisfied and revenue was properly recognized for all of these accounts 
identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as a result of the determination to restate the company s financial statements and in connection with the preparation of its annual report on form k for the year ended december   management identified three material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and reported those to our audit committee 
management identified a material weakness in our procedures for recognizing revenue  specifically with respect to our procedures for assessing whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
this material weakness resulted in the incorrect recognition of revenue in our financial statements for the second and third quarters of in addition  management identified a material weakness in our control environment  specifically relating to our tone at the top 
this material weakness was evidenced by the control tone and control consciousness of our former chief executive officer and resulted in the override and the possibility of override of controls or interference with our policies  procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
management also identified a material weakness in the design and operation of our procedures for determining the accuracy and completeness of our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts 
this material weakness resulted in a misstatement of accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of and an understatement of our general and administrative expenses for the period 
prior to the filing of this report  we have taken certain steps to remediate these material weaknesses and are in the process of finalizing a plan and timetable for the implementation of additional remediation measures to further address these material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses and the remediation measures are further described in item a of this form k 
overview we are a developer of video compression technology and technology for enabling multimedia in resource limited environments such as battery operated mobile handsets

in addition  we license our software products  which include video and audio codecs and encoding and server software  for use with video delivery platforms 
we also license software that encodes video in the adobe macromedia flash format  the flash format uses our vp video codec 
we also license our hardware video codec to companies that incorporate our technology into the semi conductors and devices 
hantro acquisition on november   we completed the acquisition of all of the share capital of hantro products oy hantro  a finnish corporation 
under the exchange agreement  hantro s security holders exchanged all of the outstanding capital shares of hantro for a total consideration of  net of  received in february in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the number of shares issued was determined on the basis of the volume weighted average price of on s common stock during the ten business days prior to the closing  with an upper limit of per share and a lower limit of per share 
because the closing share price as calculated pursuant to the foregoing formula was less than  we issued a set number of  shares  as specified in the share exchange agreement 
the  shares so issued represent approximately of our outstanding common stock as of november  in addition  we are obligated to issue an additional  shares of our common stock to the hantro security holders because hantro s net revenue for the fiscal year exceeded  the  shares issued and issuable will result in of our outstanding common stock as of december  company history founded in as the duck corporation  a privately owned entity  we originally developed and marketed compression technology that enabled developers of computer video games  video games for dedicated video game consoles and multi media presentations on computers to convert an analog video signal to a digital video signal  and to compress the signal for storage and playback on the required device 
in june of  the duck corporation was merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of applied capital funding  inc  a public company whose name was concurrently changed to oncom inc and subsequently changed to on technologies  inc  a delaware corporation 
at that time  we had developed proprietary technology that enabled the compression  storage and streaming of high quality video signals over high bandwidth networks ie broadband 
on november   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of hantro 
hantro develops technology for enabling multimedia in resource limited environments such as battery operated mobile handsets 
to date  we have incurred substantial costs to create technology products and services 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of 
we will continue to incur costs to develop  introduce and enhance products and services  build brand awareness and expand our business 
we may also incur significant additional costs related to technology  marketing or acquisitions of businesses and technologies to respond to changes in this rapidly developing industry 
these costs may not correspond with any meaningful increases in revenues in the near term  if at all  and may therefore result in negative operating cash flows until such time as we generate sufficient revenues to offset such costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have disclosed all significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition equity based compensation valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets revenue recognition 
we currently recognize revenue from professional services and the sale of software licenses 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the amount of revenue recognized in any given accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any given accounting period depending upon judgments made by or estimates utilized by management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
under each arrangement  revenues are recognized when a non cancelable agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the products or applications have been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as product licenses  post contract customer support  or training 
the determination of the fair value is based on the vendor specific objective evidence available to us 
if such evidence of the fair value of each element of the arrangement does not exist  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until such time that evidence of the fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
our software licensing arrangements typically consist of two elements a software license and post contract customer support pcs 
we recognize license revenues based on the residual method after all elements other than pcs have been delivered as prescribed by sop we recognize pcs revenues over the term of the maintenance contract or on a per usage basis  whichever is stated in the contract 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of pcs is determined by reference to the price the customer will have to pay for pcs when it is sold separately ie the renewal rate 
most of our license agreements offer additional pcs at a stated price 
revenue is recognized on a per copy basis for licensed software when each copy of the licensed software purchased by the customer or reseller is delivered 
we do not allow returns  exchanges or price protection for sales of software licenses to our customers or resellers  and we do not allow our resellers to purchase software licenses under consignment arrangements 
when engineering and consulting services are sold together with a software license  the arrangement typically requires customization and integration of the software into a third party hardware platform 
in these arrangements  we require the customer to pay a fixed fee for the engineering and consulting services and a licensing fee in the form of a per unit royalty 
we account for engineering and consulting arrangements in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the engineering or consulting services and those services do not include contractual milestones or other acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion contract method based upon input measures  such as hours 
when such estimates are not available  we defer all revenue recognition until we have completed the contract and have no further obligations to the customer 
encoding services consist of services that convert video and audio content into formats for delivery to end users 
encoding services are generally provided under per unit or time and materials contracts 
under these contracts  we recognize revenue when services have been rendered and we have no further interest or obligation in the goods and services  which is generally the date on which the goods or services have been delivered to the customer 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been low and within our expectations  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
acquisitions 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as purchased in process research and development ipr d based on the estimated fair values 
we use various models to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these models include the discounted cash flow dcf  the royalty savings method and the cost savings approach 
the valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
we derive our discount rates from our internal rate of return based on our internal forecasts and we may adjust the discount rate giving consideration to specific risk factors of each asset 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
equity based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations as an operating expense  based on their fair values on grant date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  non cash compensation expense is recognized under the fair value method for the portion of outstanding share based awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r for which service has not been rendered  and for any future share based awards granted or modified after adoption 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
we recognize share based compensation cost associated with awards subject to graded vesting in accordance with the accelerated method specified in fasb interpretation no 
pursuant to which each vesting tranche is treated as a separate award 
the compensation cost associated with each vesting tranche is recognized as expense evenly over the vesting period of that tranche 
accounting for impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we assessed the fair value of the goodwill that resulted from the wildform acquisition for impairment in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
in estimating the fair value of the business  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business  there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows 
we also consider market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
as of december   we believe that no such impairment has occurred 
results of operations the discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december  includes the financial results of hantro from november  the date of acquisition  consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the inclusion of these results renders direct comparison with results for prior periods less meaningful 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses  where appropriate  trends we believe are significant  separate and apart from the impact of our merger with hantro 
revenue 
our revenue for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively  and was derived from the sale of software and hardware licenses  engineering  consulting and support services  license royalties and other services 
the revenue for consists of  from on usa and  from hantro  our finnish subsidiary  from november  the date of acquisition 
the fiscal revenue of hantro for the full fiscal year was  the increase in revenue during the last quarter of fiscal of hantro is the result of hantro s new products video decoder  and encoders which covers the consumer device segment in addition to the mobile phone segment 
our combined revenue increased  for the year ended december  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in license sales of our hantro and flix product lines and an increase in royalties earned 
as a percent of total revenue  license revenue decreased to in from in  engineering services and support decreased to in from in royalties increased to of revenue in from in for the year ended december   license revenue was  of which our vpx licenses were  flix licenses were  and hantro licenses from date of acquisition were  for the year ended december   license revenue was  of which our vpx licenses were  and flix licenses were  for the year ended december   license revenue was  of which the company s vpx licenses were  and flix licenses were  the following table sets forth the allocation of revenues  in terms of percentages  for the years ended december   and licenses engineering services and support royalties other total for the years ended december   and  software licenses were the significant revenue stream and are expected to be the significant future revenue stream as we continue to provide these services and products to clients who deliver high quality video to proprietary networks  consumer electronic devices  wireless applications and ip based end users 
operating expenses year ended december versus our operating expenses consist of cost of revenues  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
our operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared with  for the year ended december  cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes personnel and related overhead expenses  rent and related energy costs  consulting costs  fees paid for licensed technology  depreciation  amortization of purchased technology and certain other operating expenses 
cost of revenue was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  cost of revenue increased  for the year ended december  compared with the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of  in amortization of the hantro purchased technology  partially offset by a decrease in engineering costs associated with products sold during the period

research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  is primarily attributed to  research and development expenses from hantro coupled with a higher percentage of the us engineering time dedicated to research and development projects

we believe that the current rate of expenditures will remain consistent throughout sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses excluding equity based compensation  consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs and increases in year end bonuses  commissions  tradeshow costs  marketing and promotional costs incurred to create brand awareness and public relations expenses

these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in legal fees in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in as a result of the internal investigation of the company s former ceo 
we believe that the current rate of expenditures will remain consistent throughout at december   we had approximately full time employees as compared to approximately full time employees at december  this increase is primarily the result of the hantro acquisition 
we expect to hire employees as necessary in order to attain our strategic objectives

it was determined that on june   the company experienced an ownership change to which internal revenue code section applied 
of the current  in the company s united states  net operating loss carryforward   was incurred prior to the june  change date 
the annual internal revenue code section limitation is  based on this limitation  the company believes the entire pre change net operating loss was available for use by however  because the company s ability to utilize these net operating losses is in doubt  the company maintains a full valuation allowance against their total net operating loss carryforward

the company s filed income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before the extent of the actual future use of our net operating loss carry forwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn
