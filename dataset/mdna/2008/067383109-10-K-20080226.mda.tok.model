table of contents management s use of non gaap measures net sales on a constant currency basis is a non gaap financial measure 
the company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company s investors 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
the limitation of these non gaap measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis 
non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for gaap results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue  net of discounts and rebates  when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured 
unless agreed otherwise  the company s terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss pass fob origin 
certain sales to domestic and european distributors are fob destination 
for arrangements where the company s terms state fob destination  the company records sales on this basis 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out lifo method 
for all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out fifo method 
due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the lifo method and the fifo method is not significant 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with fas r 
under the fair value provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company utilizes a binomial model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company s expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options 
the company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility 
ii 
table of contents this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
legal accruals the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including for example  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  the company accrues the minimum amount of the range 
the company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
income taxes the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions as well as other matters 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
the company regularly assesses its tax position for such matters and includes reserves for those differences in position 
the reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired and or upon the conclusion of the tax examination 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period 
effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

table of contents at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts 
in estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
valuation of purchased r d  goodwill and intangible assets when the company acquires another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between purchased r d  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
purchased r d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased r d and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased r d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for purchased r d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including purchased r d  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the company s estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
intangible assets consist primarily of patents  distribution agreements  and other intellectual property  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at december  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million  and if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
in december  the company issued million of notes due note holders had a one time option to redeem the notes at par value on december   and accordingly  the company had classified the notes as current during the month period ending december  in the fourth quarter of  approximately million of the notes were redeemed and the remaining balance of approximately million has been reclassified as long term debt 
the market value of the notes approximates million at december  assuming a basis point increase or decrease in us interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes would approximate million or million  respectively  on december  ii
