item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august references to and relate to the week years ended august  and september   respectively 
references to relate to the week year ended september  key items for included net sales increased over  driven by an increase in comparable sales sales in warehouses open for at least one year and the opening of new warehouses opened and closed due to relocations in  membership fees increased  to billion  primarily due to new membership sign ups at warehouses opened in and increased penetration of our higher fee executive membership program  gross margin net sales less merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point over the prior year  which included a million lifo charge  resulting from increases in the cost of certain food items and gasoline  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points over the prior year  net income increased to billion  or per diluted share  in compared to billion  or per diluted share  in  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share in april  and we repurchased million shares of our common stock  at an average cost of per share  totaling approximately million 
as previously reported  was impacted by the following unusual items  the effects of which are reflected in the table below sales returns reserve we revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include a longer timeframe for returns  as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items 
employee tax consequences on stock options we made payments to employees in connection with changes in exercise prices designed to avoid adverse tax consequences for employees and recorded a charge for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the united states 
excise tax refund we received a refund related to through  as a result of a settlement with the us internal revenue service relating to excise taxes previously paid 
deferred membership we analyzed the timing of recognition of membership fees  resulting in a reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years  as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results

gasoline sales also contributed to the billion adjusted net sales growth by approximately billion  with approximately billion related to the increase in gasoline sales prices 
additionally  we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales  which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members  with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency 
gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately billion 
comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately basis points 
significantly stronger foreign currencies  particularly in canada  positively impacted comparable sales by approximately billion  or basis points 
reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 
while overall sales in were not materially affected by general economic conditions  we believe that those conditions have constrained and will continue to constrain the growth of spending by our members on hardlines and softlines relative to food and sundries 
in addition  risks related to general economic conditions  including those arising from price increases due to rising fuel and commodity costs and other factors  will continue to impact overall consumer spending  although due to the nature of our business model we believe we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment

the billion increase in net sales is comprised of billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during and  partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns

in the fourth quarter of  the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of million as compared to the fourth quarter of where our reserve was increased  resulting in a decrease to net sales of million

these decreases were partially offset by a net basis point increase from our merchandise departments  particularly fresh foods  food and sundries  costco online and our international operations  partially offset by a decrease in softlines 
we ve experienced price increases from our suppliers at an increased rate  which may continue 
those increases generally are reflected in our selling prices  but to the extent they are not or are delayed  our gross margins will be adversely affected

in december  one of our enhanced money fund investments  columbia strategic cash portfolio fund columbia  ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value 
in light of the restricted liquidity  we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account 
we assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings  as available  coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest 
in  we recognized million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities million  million and million in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively

derivatives we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas  in accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
we use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms 
these forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
the aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of and was million and million  respectively

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices  particularly electricity  which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately of our warehouses in the us and canada  as well as certain depots and other facilities 
we have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis 
these contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under sfas and require no mark to market adjustment 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments 
we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warehouse closing costs  insurance self insurance liabilities  investments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales  net of estimated returns  at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels 
amounts collected from members  which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes  are recorded on a net basis 
we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members 
we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis  whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period 
in  we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each member s specific renewal date  as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method  which was based on the period in which the fee was collected 
this review resulted in a million reduction to membership fee revenue in and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet 
this adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors 
our executive members qualify for a reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of per year  on all qualified purchases made at costco 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales  with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 
the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
the lifo inventory adjustment in reduced ending inventory and gross margin by million 
at the end of  merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts  which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approaches 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment  such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated 
a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability  particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations 
these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets 
we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location 
we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 
insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
investments investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or issuer conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments

fin  which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items  at the beginning of the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge  if any  from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate
