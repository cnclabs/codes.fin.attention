item business 
overview harvard bioscience  a delaware corporation  is a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of specialized products  primarily apparatus and scientific instruments  used to advance life science research at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories worldwide 
we sell our products to thousands of researchers in over countries primarily through our page catalog and various other specialty catalogs  our website  and through distributors  including ge healthcare  thermo fisher scientific inc and vwr 
we have sales and manufacturing operations in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  spain and austria and sales facilities in france and canada 
our history our business began in under the name harvard apparatus and has grown over the intervening years with the development and evolution of modern life science tools 
our early inventions include the mechanical syringe pump in the s for drug infusion and the microprocessor controlled syringe pump in the s 
in march  a group of investors led by our ceo and president acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor  harvard apparatus 
following this acquisition  we redirected the focus of the company to participate in the higher growth areas  or bottlenecks  within life science research by acquiring and licensing innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development and marketing  partnerships and acquisitions 
since march  we have completed business or product line acquisitions related to our continuing operations and internally developed many new product lines including new generation harvard apparatus syringe pumps  advanced inspira ventilators  genequant dna rna protein calculators  ultrospec spectrophotometers  our new microliter spectrophotometer  d electrophoresis products  uvm plate readers and the btx mos well electroporation system 

table of contents in july  we announced plans to divest our capital equipment business segment 
the decision to divest this business was based on the fact that market conditions for the capital equipment business segment had been such that this business did not meet our expectations and the decision to focus our resources on our apparatus and instrumentation business segment 
as a result  we began reporting our capital equipment business segment as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both part of our capital equipment business segment 
the copas flow cytometry product line held by our union biometrica us and german subsidiaries  both of which are still included in discontinued operations  was not included in this sale  and we continue to pursue a sale of this product line separately 
accordingly  unless otherwise indicated  the discussion of our business and our products is focused on our continuing operations  which constitute our apparatus and instrumentation business 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading provider of tools for life science research 
our strategy is to have a broad range of highly specialized but relatively inexpensive products that have strong positions in niche markets in life science research we believe that having a broad product offering reduces the risk of being dependent on a single technology  we believe that having relatively inexpensive products reduces the volatility associated with expensive capital equipment  and we believe focusing on niche markets reduces head to head competition with the major instrument companies 
we seek to grow this range of products through internal development of new products and the acquisition of closely related products 
we use acquisitions to expand our product offerings because we believe we can use our well established brands and distribution channels to accelerate the growth of these acquired products 
we also believe that our expertise in operational management frequently allows us to improve profitability at acquired companies 
our products today  our broad product range is generally targeted towards two major application areas admet screening and molecular biology 
admet screening the goal of admet screening is to identify compounds that have toxic side effects or undesirable physiological or pharmacological properties 
these pharmacological properties consist of absorption  distribution  metabolism and elimination  which together with toxicology  form the acronym admet 
we have a wide range of products that our customers use to help their researchers conduct better experiments on cells  tissues  organs and animals 

table of contents we primarily sell these products under the harvard apparatus  btx  kd scientific  hugo sachs elektronik  panlab and warner instruments brand names 
the individual sales prices of these products are often under  but when combined into systems such as the hugo sachs isolated organ system the total sales price can be over  we typically sell our admet products through our catalogs and website with support from technical specialists  although btx and kd scientific branded products are primarily sold through distributors 
some of these products are described below absorption diffusion chambers a diffusion chamber is a small plastic chamber with a membrane separating the two halves of the chamber used to measure the absorption of a drug into the bloodstream 
the membrane can either be tissue such as intestinal tissue or a cultured layer of cells such as human colon cells 
this creates a miniaturized model of intestinal absorption 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the assets of navicyte inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of trega biosciences now sygnis pharma ag and today we manufacture and sell a wide range of tissue handling products under the warner instruments brand name 
distribution well equilibrium dialysis plate for serum protein binding assays our well equilibrium dialysis plate contains pairs of chambers with each pair separated by a membrane 
the protein target is placed on one side of the membrane and the drug on the other 
the small molecule drug diffuses through the membrane 
if it binds to the target  it cannot diffuse back again 
if it does not bind  it will diffuse back and forth until equilibrium is established 
once equilibrium is established  the concentration of the drug can be measured thereby indicating the strength of the binding 
this product is principally used for admet screening to determine if a drug binds to blood proteins 
a certain level of reversible binding is advantageous in order to promote good distribution of a drug through the human body 
however  if the binding is too strong  it may impair normal protein function and cause toxic effects 
these products are part of our sample preparation product line which we began offering in after our acquisition of amika 
metabolism and elimination organ testing systems organ testing systems use glass or plastic chambers together with stimulators and recording electrodes to study organ function 
organ testing systems enable either whole organs or strips of tissue from organs such as hearts  livers and lungs to be kept functioning outside the body while researchers perform experiments with them 
this typically allows for multiple studies on a single donor animal 
studies on isolated livers are useful in determining metabolism and studies on kidneys are useful in determining elimination 
we have sold basic versions of these systems for many years  but significantly expanded our product offerings through our acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik and our acquisition of panlab sl panlab 
toxicology precision infusion pumps and behavioral products infusion pumps  typically syringe pumps  are used to accurately infuse very small quantities of liquid  commonly drugs 
infusion pumps are generally used for long term toxicology testing of drugs by infusion into animals  usually laboratory rats 
we sell a wide range of different types of syringe pumps and many other products for infusing samples into and collecting samples from tissues  organs and animals 
we expanded our range of infusion pumps with the acquisition of kd scientific in we also design and manufacture behavioral products used in neuroscience  cardiology  psychological and respiratory studies to evaluate the effects of situational stimuli  drugs and nutritional infusions on motor and sensory  activity and learning and test behavior 
we expanded our behavioral product offerings with the acquisition of panlab in october cell injection systems cell injection systems use extremely fine bore glass capillaries to penetrate and inject drugs into or around individual cells 
cell injection systems are used to study the effects of drugs on single cells 
injection is accomplished either with air pressure or  if the drug molecule is electrically charged  by applying an electric current 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the research products of medical systems corporation and considerably expanded our presence in this market with our acquisitions of clark electromedical instruments in and warner instruments in 
table of contents ventilators ventilators use a piston driven air pump to inflate the lungs of an anesthetized animal 
ventilators are typically used in surgical procedures common in life science research and are part of our harvard apparatus product line 
in the late s we launched our advanced inspira ventilators  which have significant safety and ease of use features  such as default safety settings 
we further expanded our ventilator product line with the minivent acquired as part of our acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik in and expanded our presence in anesthesia with our acquisition of international market supply  ltd 
in electroporation products acquired with our purchase of the btx division of genetronics biomedical corporation in january  our electroporation products include systems and generators  electrodes and accessories for research applications including in vivo  in ovo and in vitro gene delivery  electrocell fusion and nuclear transfer cloning 
through the application of precise pulsed electrical signals  electroporation systems open small pores in cell membranes allowing genes and or drugs to pass through the cell membranes 
the principal advantages of electroporation over other transfection techniques are speed  and the fact that electroporation does not require harsh chemicals that can interfere with or change cell function 
in  we launched our btx mos well electroporation system  which can greatly increase the throughput of this otherwise essentially manual technique 
distributed products in addition to our proprietary manufactured products  we buy and resell through our catalog products that are made by other manufacturers 
we have negotiated supply agreements with the majority of the companies that provide our distributed products 
these supply agreements specify pricing only and contain no minimum purchase commitments 
each of these agreements represented less than one percent of our revenues for the year ended december  distributed products accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  these distributed products enable us to provide our customers with a single source for their experimental needs 
these complementary products consist of a large variety of devices  instruments and consumable items used in experiments involving cells  tissues  organs and animals in the fields of proteomics  physiology  pharmacology  neuroscience  cell biology  molecular biology and toxicology 
we believe that our proprietary manufactured products are often leaders in their fields  however  researchers often need complementary products in order to conduct particular experiments 
most of these complementary products come from small companies that do not have our extensive distribution and marketing capabilities to reach these researchers 
molecular biology we primarily sell these products through our distributors  including ge healthcare  under their brand names 
these products are mainly scientific instruments such as spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus such as gel electrophoresis units 
the instrumentation products are typically sold for a price ranging from  to  the apparatus products typically sell for less than molecular biology spectrophotometers a spectrophotometer is an instrument widely used in molecular biology and cell biology to quantify the amount of a compound in a sample by shining a beam of white light through a prism or grating to divide it into component wavelengths 
each wavelength in turn is shone through a liquid sample and the spectrophotometer measures the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength 
microliter spectrophotometry is a technique used to measure extremely small sample sizes 
this enables the quantification of the amount of a compound in a sample 
we sell a wide range of spectrophotometers under the names ultrospec  novaspec  libra  biowave and lightwave 
our biochrom subsidiary manufactures these products  and we primarily sell them through our distribution arrangements with ge healthcare and other distributors 

table of contents dna rna protein calculators a dna rna protein calculator is a bench top instrument dedicated to quantifying the amount of dna  rna or protein in a sample 
it uses a process similar to that of a molecular biology spectrophotometer 
these are sold under the genequant name 
launched in  we believe that it was the first such instrument sold 
our biochrom subsidiary manufactures these products  and we primarily sell them through ge healthcare 
multi well plate readers multi well plate readers are widely used for high throughput screening assays in the drug discovery process 
the most common format is wells per plate 
plate readers use light to detect chemical interactions 
we introduced a range of these products in beginning with absorbance readers and followed by luminescence readers 
our asys hitech subsidiary manufactures these products  and we primarily sell them through distributors 
in june  we expanded our multi well plate reader offerings with the purchase of selected assets of anthos labtec instruments gmbh anthos  a subsidiary of beckman coulter  inc we acquired asys hitech in december through our biochrom subsidiary 
amino acid analysis systems an amino acid analysis system uses chromatography to separate the amino acids in a sample and then uses a chemical reaction to detect each one in turn as they flow out of the chromatography column 
amino acids are the building blocks of proteins 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the amino acid analysis systems business of the biotronik subsidiary of eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh and integrated it with the existing amino acid analysis systems business in our biochrom subsidiary 
we sell these systems  which are more expensive than most of our products  through our biochrom direct sales force and through distributors including ge healthcare 
low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers a liquid dispenser dispenses low volumes  typically microliters  of liquids into high density microtitre plates used in high throughput screening processes in life science research 
our unique technology enables dispensing to take place without the need for contact between the droplet and the liquid already present in the plate  thereby removing any risk of cross contamination from the process 
our asys hitech subsidiary primarily markets these products  and we sell them under distributor brand names as well as our own name 
asys hitech develops  manufactures and markets both these liquid dispensers and a line of plate readers see above for a description of plate readers 
gel electrophoresis systems gel electrophoresis is a method for separating and purifying dna  rna and proteins 
in gel electrophoresis  an electric current is run through a thin slab of gel and the dna  rna or protein molecules separate out based on their charge and size 
the gel is contained in a plastic tank with an associated power supply 
we entered this market with the acquisition of scie plas in november and greatly expanded our range of gel electrophoresis products with our november acquisition of hoefer 
the majority of hoefer revenues come from a distribution partnership with ge healthcare but we have also added new distributors and have established a catalog web distribution channel under the hoefer name 
our customers our end user customers are primarily research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories  including the us national institutes of health  or nih 
our academic customers have included major colleges and universities such as baylor college  cambridge university  harvard university  johns hopkins university  massachusetts institute of technology  yale university and the university of texas md anderson center 
our pharmaceutical and biotechnological customers have included pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories such as amgen  inc  astrazeneca plc  genentech  inc  johnson johnson and the max planck institute 

table of contents we conduct direct sales in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  spain and canada 
we also maintain distributors in other countries 
aggregate sales to our largest customer  ge healthcare  a distributor with end users similar to ours  accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  compared to approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  we have several thousand customers worldwide and no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues for such periods 
sales and marketing for the year ended december   revenues from direct sales to end users through our harvard apparatus catalog and various other specialty catalogs represented approximately of our revenues  revenues from direct sales to end users through our direct sales force represented approximately of our total revenues  and revenues from sales of our products through distributors represented approximately of our revenues 
direct sales we periodically produce and mail a harvard apparatus full line catalog  most recently launched during february  which contains approximately  products on pages and is printed in varying quantities ranging from  to  copies 
the latest catalog  which is accessible on our website  serves as the primary sales tool for the harvard apparatus product line  which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers 
our leadership position in many of our manufactured products creates traffic to the catalog and website and enables cross selling and facilitates the introduction of new products 
in addition to the comprehensive catalog  we create and mail abridged catalogs that focus on specific product areas along with direct mailers and targeted e mailers  which introduce or promote new products 
we distribute the majority of our products ordered from our catalog  through our worldwide subsidiaries 
in those regions where we do not have a subsidiary  or for products which we have acquired that had distributors in place at the time of our acquisition as the distribution channel  we use distributors 
distributors ge healthcare is our largest distributor  accounting for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  ge healthcare has been our primary distributor  marketer and seller of a significant portion of our spectrophotometer and dna rna calculator product lines of our biochrom subsidiary 
our biochrom subsidiary is currently in negotiations to enter into a new agreement with ge healthcare to serve as our distributor for a significant portion of our biochrom products 
we expect to have a new agreement signed in the first half of in november  in connection with the acquisition of hoefer from ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences  we entered into a separate distribution agreement with ge healthcare for the distribution of the hoefer products 
this contract has a five year term with an automatic five year renewal period  provides for minimum purchases for the first three years  allows us to use the hoefer name which we acquired in the transaction on direct sales by us to end users or through other distributors  and may be terminated after five years with a one year advance notice 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement  such as pricing  exclusivity and delivery  by either party  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
on october   ge healthcare sent a notice of non renewal in connection with the distribution agreement between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and ge healthcare dated november  as a consequence  this agreement with ge healthcare will terminate on september  we intend to negotiate a new distribution agreement with a new set of terms and conditions and expect to have a new agreement with ge healthcare before the current agreement terminates 

table of contents in addition to engaging ge healthcare as the primary distributor for our biochrom and hoefer products  we also engage distributors for the sales of harvard apparatus  btx  kd scientific  asys hitech  panlab and scieplas branded products in certain areas of the world and for certain product lines 
in those regions where we do not have a subsidiary  and for products which we have acquired that had distributors in place at the time of our acquisition as the distribution channel  we use distributors 
backlog our order backlog was approximately million as of december  and million as of december  we include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders 
purchase orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment 
our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
we typically ship our backlog at any given time within days 
research and development our principal research and development mission is to develop products which address bottlenecks within the life science research process  particularly for application in the areas of admet screening and molecular biology 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to make investments in research and development activities as we deem appropriate given the circumstances at such time 
we plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and development programs and acquiring products through business and technology acquisitions 
we maintain development staff in most of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and to re engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation level 
in house development is focused on our current technologies 
for major new technologies  our strategy has been to partner with universities  government labs or pharmaceutical companies to develop technology into commercially viable products 
manufacturing we manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the united states  the united kingdom  spain  austria and germany 
we have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities  and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time 
we maintain in house key manufacturing know how  technologies and resources 
we seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in house  and while some of our products are dependent on sole source suppliers  we do not believe our dependence upon these suppliers creates any significant risks 
our manufacturing operations are primarily to assemble and test 
our manufacturing of syringe pumps  ventilators  cell injectors  miniaturized sample preparation products and electroporation products takes place in holliston  massachusetts 
the manufacture of our cell biology and electrophysiology products takes place in both our holliston  massachusetts facility and our hamden  connecticut facility 
our manufacturing of spectrophotometers and amino acid analysis systems takes place in our cambridge  england facility 
our manufacturing of surgery and anesthesia related products and physiology teaching products takes place in edenbridge  england 
our manufacturing of complete organ testing systems takes place in march hugstetten  germany 
our electrophoresis products are manufactured at our warwickshire  england facility and our san francisco  california facility 
our low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers and our plate readers are manufactured in our facility in eugendorf  austria 
our manufacturing of our behavioral science products primarily takes place in our barcelona  spain facility 

table of contents competition the markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase 
we compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for life science research 
many of our competitors have greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources  and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have 
moreover  our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
these competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products  which could render our products obsolete 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we are not aware of any significant products sold by us  which are currently obsolete 
we believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to companies engaged in life science research 
we are not aware of any competitor that offers a product line of comparable breadth across our target markets 
we have numerous competitors on a product line basis 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance  including quality  reliability and speed  technical support  price and delivery time 
we compete with several companies that provide instruments for admet screening and molecular biology 
in the admet screening area  we compete with  among others  amaxa gmbh  becton  dickinson and company  eppendorf ag  general valve corp  kent scientific corporation  razel scientific instruments  inc  and ugo basile 
in the molecular biology products area  we compete with  among others  beckman coulter  inc  bio rad laboratories  inc  eppendorf ag  invitrogen corporation  mds analytical technologies  perkinelmer  inc  and thermo fisher scientific corporation 
seasonality our business is generally not seasonal  however  sales and earnings in our third quarter are usually flat to down sequentially primarily because there are a large number of holidays and vacations during the quarter  especially in europe 
our fourth quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts 
patents or patent applications cover many of our new technologies 
most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only 
we have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products 
in our continuing operations  we have issued us patents and pending applications 
in our discontinued operations  we have issued us patents and pending applications 
generally  us patents have a term of years from the date of issue for patents issued from applications filed with the us patent office prior to june   and years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date in the case of patents issued from applications filed on or after june  our issued us patents will expire between and our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies 

table of contents patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property 
however  the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain 
the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection 
in addition  our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged  invalidated  circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may protect our proprietary rights to a greater or lesser extent  as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve  particularly in areas of interest to us 
as a result  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us 
in view of these factors  our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
although many of our us employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment  through the misuse of confidential information  soliciting employees  soliciting customers and the like  the enforceability of these provisions varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and  in some circumstances  they may not be enforceable 
in addition  it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so  there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products 
we expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps 
in addition  patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
moreover  such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could seriously harm our business or financial condition 
harvard is a registered trademark of harvard university 
the marks harvard apparatus and harvard bioscience are being used pursuant to a license agreement entered into in december between harvard university and harvard bioscience  inc government regulation we are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
in particular  our products are not subject to pre market approval by the united states food and drug administration for use on human clinical patients 
in addition  we believe we are in compliance with all relevant environmental laws 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed employees  of which are full time and are part time  in our continuing operations and employees  of whom are full time and one is part time  in our discontinued operations 
geographical residence information for these employees is summarized in the table below continuing operations discontinued operations total united states united kingdom spain austria germany canada france total we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees is subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
discontinued operations in july  we announced plans to divest our capital equipment business segment 
the decision to divest this business was based on the fact that market conditions for the capital equipment business segment had been such that this business did not meet our expectations and the decision to focus our resources on our apparatus and instrumentation business segment 
as a result  we began reporting our capital equipment business segment as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both of which were part of our capital equipment business segment  to digilab  inc the purchase price paid by digilab under the terms of the asset purchase agreement consisted of  in cash plus additional consideration in the form of an earn out based on of the revenue generated by the acquired business as it is conducted by digilab over a three year period post transaction 
any earn out amounts will be evidenced by interest bearing promissory notes due on november  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a loss on sale of million 
there was no value ascribed to the contingent consideration from the earn out agreement  as realization is uncertain 
the copas flow cytometry product line held by our union biometrica us and german subsidiaries  was not included in this sale  and we continue to pursue a sale of this product line separately  and until sold remains in discontinued operations 
generally  the products sold by the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment are large scientific instruments that use fluid flow the copas flow cytometry product line and lasers to analyze small model organisms and large cells or clusters 
these systems are typically sold for over  each and are primarily sold by our field sales force and by distributors in select countries 
our direct sales force is complemented in the field by our technical support and field service organizations  and together they effectively sell and service our capital equipment product lines

risk factors 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on a number of factors  including our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the timing of purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the timing of catalog mailings and new product introductions  the release of grant and budget funding  future acquisitions and our substantial sales to european customers  who in summer months often defer purchases 
in particular  delays or reduction in purchase orders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could have a material adverse effect on us and could adversely affect our stock price 
uncertain economic trends may adversely impact our business 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  reduced demand for our products as a result of the uncertainty in the general economic environment in which our customers and we operate 
we cannot project the extent of the impact of the economic environment specific to our industry 
if economic conditions worsen or if an economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
we may not realize the expected benefits from acquisitions due to difficulties integrating the businesses  operations and product lines 
our ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the integration and leveraging of technology  operations  sales and marketing channels and personnel 
the integration process is a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we may have difficulty successfully integrating the acquired businesses  the domestic and foreign operations or the product lines  and as a result  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
additionally  we cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us and the acquired companies  respectively  operating as separate companies in the past 

table of contents we have been actively engaged in acquiring and divesting companies 
as a result  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either the acquiring company s stockholders  an acquired company s previous stockholders  the divested company s stockholders or our current stockholders 
we may be the subject of lawsuits from either the acquiring company s stockholders  an acquired company s previous stockholders  the divested company s stockholders or our current stockholders 
these lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition or divestiture target prior to the date of the acquisition or divestiture  from the acquisition or divestiture transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition or divestiture 
defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management s attention from the operation of the business 
additionally  these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew  certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets 
attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future 
we will consider the acquisition of other businesses 
however  we may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future  which could negatively impact the growth of our business 
we expect that our competitors  many of which have significantly greater resources than we do  will compete with us to acquire compatible businesses 
this competition could increase prices for acquisitions that we would likely pursue 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on us 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the recoverability of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and other long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable

 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions are evaluated annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment  to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
if it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets is impaired  we will be required to write off that portion of the asset according to the methods defined by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which could have an adverse effect on net income for the period in which the write off occurs 
during we recorded impairment and write down charges of approximately million on goodwill and other intangible assets  which are classified under the caption discontinued operations  net of tax 
in addition  if at any time prior to the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment we determine that the fair value less costs to sell is below the current carrying value we will record additional impairment losses that could be significant 
at december   our continuing operations had goodwill and intangible assets of million  or  of our total assets 
future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 
if our accounting estimates are not correct  our financial results could be adversely affected 
management judgment and estimates are necessarily required in the application of our critical accounting policies 
we discuss these estimates in the subsection entitled critical accounting policies beginning on page if our estimates are incorrect  our future financial operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenues from our non us operations represented approximately of total revenues for we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues 
in addition  a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million and expenses of million net million during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a foreign currency gain of approximately  for the year ended december  and a decrease in foreign equity of approximately million for the year ended december   changes in a specific country or region s political or economic conditions  including europe  in particular  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting the ability to expatriate profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  and unfavorable labor regulations applicable to european operations  such as severance and the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the european union 
we may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international revenues into us dollars 
approximately of our business from continuing operations during was conducted in functional currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
if we are not able to manage our growth  our operating profits or losses may be adversely impacted 
our success will depend on the expansion of our operations through both organic growth and acquisitions 
effective growth management will place increased demands on management  operational and financial resources and expertise 
to manage growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue  resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability 

table of contents if we fail to retain key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management  technical and scientific personnel 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice 
the loss of the services of any member of the senior management team  including the chief executive officer  chane graziano  the president  david green  the chief operating officer  susan luscinski  the chief financial officer  bryce chicoyne or any of the managerial  technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense  and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including boston  massachusetts and london and cambridge  england  and where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the areas of general management  finance  information technology  engineering and science  and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive  and may become more expensive in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products 
we expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development stage companies that continually enter the market 
we anticipate that these competitors will include companies developing and marketing life sciences research tools  health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  analytical instrument companies  and companies developing life science or drug discovery technologies 
currently  our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products 
our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  operational  marketing and technical resources than we do 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts  and may have greater name recognition 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants into the field 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our products compete in markets that are subject to technological change  and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies 
because the market for life science tools is characterized by technological change and frequent new product introductions  our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve existing products and develop new products 
to meet the evolving needs of its customers  we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products 
however  we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
in addition  our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace 
we may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve 
our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology  market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline  and we could experience significant losses 

table of contents we offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
the speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs 
failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses 
our million credit facility contains certain financial and negative covenants  the breach of which may adversely affect our financial condition 
in december  we amended our million credit facility with brown brothers harriman co 
under which we had drawn down million as of december  the credit facility contains various financial and other covenants  including covenants relating to income  debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements 
if we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants  in addition to other actions the creditor may require  the amounts drawn on the million facility may become immediately due and payable 
this immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition and we may be forced by our creditor into actions  which may not be in our best interests 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy  expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our financial resources  which include available cash  cash generated from operations  and debt and equity capacity  will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least twelve months 
however  this expectation is premised on the current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital could seriously harm our business and product development and acquisition efforts 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable 
we may be unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our credit facility with brown brothers harriman contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and acquisitions funded with equity in excess of million 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail operations or change our business strategy 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology  which would impair our ability to compete in our markets 
our continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our products throughout the world 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
in our continuing operations  we have issued us patents and pending applications 
in our discontinued operations  we have issued us patents and pending applications 
we also own numerous us registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending 
we rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
however  our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our ability to be commercially competitive will be materially impaired 

table of contents in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship 
however  we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances 
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
as a result  we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  including the patent rights  trademarks and trade names of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which could result in reduced revenue 
many of our current and potential customers are from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be one of our major sources of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as pricing pressures as third party payers continue challenging the pricing of medical products and services  government regulation  ongoing consolidation and uncertainty of technological change  and to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries 

table of contents in particular  the biotechnology industry is largely dependent on raising capital to fund its operations 
if biotechnology companies are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as it relates to both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  many companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire  which could result in reduced revenues for those companies 
if pharmaceutical companies suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations  they may be unable to purchase our products  and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are dependent  both directly and indirectly  upon general health care spending patterns  particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies 
many of our customers  including universities  government research laboratories  private foundations and other institutions  obtain funding for the purchase of products from grants by governments or government agencies 
there exists the risk of a potential decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research  which could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants 
if government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences terminates its distribution agreements with us  fails to renew them on favorable terms or fails to perform its obligations under the distribution agreements  it could impair the marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products and result in lost revenues 
during  general electric company acquired amersham plc  the parent of amersham biosciences 
in connection with the acquisition  amersham biosciences was renamed ge healthcare 
while ge healthcare has indicated its intention to continue amersham s presence in the life science market  and we believe our relationship with ge healthcare is good  we cannot guarantee that the distribution agreements will be renewed  that ge healthcare will aggressively market our products in the future or that ge healthcare will continue the partnership 
if any of these events occurs  our marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products may be impaired and our revenues may be adversely impacted 
for  approximately of our revenues were generated through two distribution agreements with ge healthcare 
our biochrom subsidiary is currently in negotiations to enter into a new agreement with ge healthcare 
under past agreements with ge healthcare they have acted as the primary marketing and distribution channel for a significant portion of the products of our biochrom subsidiary 
we have been restricted from allowing another person or entity to distribute  market and sell a significant portion of the products of our biochrom subsidiary into the life sciences market 
we have also been restricted from making or promoting sales of a significant portion of the products of our biochrom subsidiary to any person or entity other than ge healthcare or its authorized sub distributors 
we have had little or no control over ge healthcare s marketing and sales activities or the use of its resources 
ge healthcare may fail to purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities 
the failure by ge healthcare to perform these activities could materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
in addition  our inability to enter into a new agreement with ge healthcare for product distribution could materially impede the growth of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue 
the second distribution agreement  between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and ge healthcare was entered into in november in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of the hoefer d gel electrophoresis business  including the hoefer name  from amersham bioscience 
the agreement provides that hoefer will be the exclusive supplier of d gel electrophoresis products to ge healthcare 
hoefer also has the right to develop  manufacture and market d gel electrophoresis products  which would be offered to ge healthcare for sale under the ge healthcare s brand name 
hoefer has the right to sell any of its products  under the hoefer brand name or any other non ge healthcare brand name  through other distribution channels  both direct and indirect 
this contract has a five year term with an automatic five year renewal period  and may be terminated after five years with a one year advance notice 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement  such as pricing  exclusivity and delivery  by either party  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 

table of contents on october   ge healthcare sent a notice of non renewal in connection with the distribution agreement between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and ge healthcare dated november  as a consequence  this agreement with ge healthcare will terminate on september  we intend to negotiate a new distribution agreement with a new set of terms and conditions and expect to have a new agreement with ge healthcare before the current agreement terminates 
we do not know  however  if we are going to be able to reach a new agreement with ge healthcare 
if we do not reach a new agreement with ge healthcare  some of our products may be impaired and our revenues may be adversely impacted 
customer  vendor and employee uncertainty about the effects of any of our acquisitions could harm us 
we and the customers of any companies we acquire may  in response to the consummation of the acquisitions  delay or defer purchasing decisions 
any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by customers could adversely affect our business 
similarly  employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future role until or after we execute our strategies with regard to employees of acquired companies 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel following an acquisition 
ethical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products 
genetic screening of humans is used to determine individual predisposition to medical conditions 
genetic screening has raised ethical issues regarding the confidentiality and appropriate uses of the resulting information 
government authorities may regulate or prohibit the use of genetic screening to determine genetic predispositions to medical conditions 
additionally  the public may disfavor and reject the use of genetic screening 
genomic and proteomic research is used to determine the role of genes and proteins in living organisms 
our products are designed and used for genomic and proteomic research and drug discovery and are generally not well suited for human screening 
however  it is possible that government authorities and the public may fail to distinguish between the genetic screening of humans and genomic and proteomic research 
if this occurs  our products and the processes for which our products are used may be subjected to government regulations intended to affect genetic screening 
further  if the public fails to distinguish between the two fields  it may pressure our customers to discontinue the research and development initiatives for which our products are used 
additionally  some of our products may be used in areas of research involving cloning  stem cells  human tissue  organ transplants  animal research and other techniques presently being explored in the life science industry 
these techniques have drawn much negative attention recently in the public forum and could face similar risks to those identified above surrounding products for genomic and proteomic research 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and could experience substantial declines in the future and  as a result  management s attention may be diverted from more productive tasks 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may become volatile and could decline in the future  perhaps substantially  in response to various factors including technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  revenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of management  securities analysts  or investors in any quarter  our ability to divest the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment on favorable terms or at all  termination or suspension of equity research coverage by securities analysts  comments of securities analysts and mistakes by or misinterpretation of comments from analysts  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or management guidance  
table of contents investment banks and securities analysts may themselves be subject to lawsuits that may adversely affect the perception of the market  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of significant acquisitions or financings or changes in strategic partnerships  non compliance with the internal control standards pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
in addition  the stock market and the nasdaq global market in general  and the biotechnology industry and small cap markets in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and bylaws may make a takeover more difficult  which could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt  which is opposed by management and the board of directors 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
in february  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  the company or a large block of our common stock 
a third party that acquires or more of our common stock an acquiring person could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the shareholder rights plan through the issuance of common stock to all shareholders other than the acquiring person 
we also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors 
such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 
although our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq global market  an active trading market for the shares may not be sustained 
future issuance of preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  privileges and other terms of these shares 
the board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of preferred stock 
cash dividends will not be paid on our common stock 
currently  we intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the near future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be a stockholder s sole source of gain for the near future 

table of contents if we are unable to complete the divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment on attractive terms  our ability to implement our business strategy and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in july  we announced our decision to divest our capital equipment business segment 
we decided to divest this business segment based on the fact that market conditions for our capital equipment business segment had been such that this business did not meet our expectations  and because we have made a decision to focus resources on our apparatus and instrumentation business segment 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to divest the remaining portion of our capital equipment business for more than current carrying value  we will record a loss in connection with the sale that could be significant 
if we are unable to sell the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment at all  we will be required to alter our current business strategy to determine how to proceed with this business segment 
as a result  we may be required to engage in further restructuring activities or cease operating some or all of this business segment and liquidate its assets 
in either case  we may incur additional expenses and additional asset impairments and management s attention may be diverted from our current business strategy 
under the terms of its credit facility  the company will be required to obtain consent from its lenders upon the sale of the capital equipment business segment 
if we are unable to obtain this consent  the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment will trigger a default under the credit facility whereby our lenders could accelerate all of our outstanding indebtedness and terminate our credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
as a result of any of these events  our ability to implement our business strategy and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
our decision to divest of our capital equipment business may cause potential customers of the remaining portion of this business to be less likely to commit to purchases of capital equipment from this business segment  which may materially adversely affect revenues generated from  and value that we may receive upon the sale of  the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment 
the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment relies on sales of capital products that are typically priced over  and supported  following their sale  by customer support  technical support and field application service support personnel 
as a result of the uncertain future of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment  potential customers may be less likely to commit to purchases of expensive capital equipment from this business segment 
accordingly  the revenues generated from  and value that we may receive upon the divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may lose key employees of the capital equipment business segment that may in turn adversely affect the revenues and operating results of the division and may reduce the value we receive upon the divestiture of the capital equipment business segment 
the divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment may disrupt our business or result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business may disrupt our apparatus and instrumentation business and divert management s attention away from our continuing operations 
we will also incur expenses in connection with our attempted divestiture of this business segment  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
this divestiture will require management to utilize estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and expenses for severances  lease cancellations and other exit costs 
actual results could differ materially from those estimated due to  among other things inability to sell the businesses at prices  or within time periods  anticipated by management  unanticipated expenditures in connection with the effectuation of the disposition  costs and length of time required to comply with legal requirements applicable to the disposition  and unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation of manufacturing and administrative functions

overview during the second quarter of  we realigned our lines of business into two business segments  the apparatus and instrumentation business segment and our capital equipment business segment 
our business had previously been arranged in a single segment 
in july  we announced plans to divest our capital equipment business segment 
the decision to divest this business was based on the fact that market conditions for the capital equipment business segment had been such that this business did not meet our expectations and the decision to focus our resources on our apparatus and instrumentation business segment 
as a result  we began reporting our capital equipment business segment as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of accordingly  unless otherwise indicated  the discussion of our business is focused on our continuing operations  which constitute our apparatus and instrumentation businesses 

table of contents from to  the revenues from our continuing operations grew from million to million  an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 
since the second half of  when we made the decision to divest the capital equipment business segment  we refocused our resources on our core apparatus and instrumentation business  which has been the cornerstone to our success over the last decade 
three significant developments that impacted our results during were the weakening of the dollar compared to foreign currencies  our second quarter acquisition of our anthos product lines and our fourth quarter acquisition of panlab 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations resulted in increased revenues on sales denominated in foreign currencies and increased expenses associated with our foreign operations 
during the second quarter of  we purchased select assets of the microplate reader and washer product lines from anthos labtec instruments gmbh  a subsidiary of beckman coulter  inc  for approximately million 
sales of our anthos product lines were approximately million in compared with approximately million for the same period in because our anthos product lines have lower gross margins  increased sales of these products contributed to lower overall gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
however  overall operating profit margins at our asys subsidiary  which includes our anthos product lines  are relatively consistent with our other subsidiaries and have increased significantly as a result of our tuck under integration strategy 
on october   the company acquired  panlab  of barcelona  spain  a distributor  manufacturer and developer of products and software for life science researchers primarily in the neuroscience research market  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition was funded by proceeds from the company s million credit facility with brown brothers harriman 
the results of operations of panlab have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the panlab acquisition strengthens our harvard apparatus franchise for specialty products within the life science research market and expands our distribution channels by establishing a subsidiary in spain 
panlab had revenues of million and pre tax income of million during the fourth quarter of we also continued our efforts to divest our capital equipment business segment 
in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both of which were part of our capital equipment business segment  to digilab  inc the purchase price paid by digilab under the terms of the asset purchase agreement consisted of  in cash plus additional consideration in the form of an earn out based on of the revenue generated by the acquired business as it is conducted by digilab over a three year period post transaction 
any earn out amounts will be evidenced by interest bearing promissory notes due on november  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a loss on sale of million 
there was no value ascribed to the contingent consideration from the earn out agreement  as realization is uncertain 
the copas flow cytometry product line held by our union biometrica us and german subsidiaries  both of which are included in discontinued operations  was not included in this sale  and we continue to pursue a sale of this product line separately 
looking forward  we have outlined five major initiatives that we expect will have a positive impact on our performance in these initiatives include the launch of a new major harvard apparatus catalog during february the launch of panlab products into us markets  the signing of a new contract with ge healthcare and the full launch of our new microliter spectrophotometer  the launch of new d electrophoresis products through our hoefer subsidiary  and the consolidation of business functions to reduce operating expenses  accordingly  we remain committed to our goal of high revenue and profit growth through a combination of organic growth and tuck under acquisitions 
while we expect the initiatives discussed above will positively impact our business  the success of these initiatives is subject to a number of factors including the competitiveness of our new products  the strength of our intellectual property underlying these products  the success of our marketing efforts and those of our distributors and the other factors identified in item a 
risk factors 

table of contents generally  management evaluates the financial performance of its operations before the effects of stock compensation expense  restructuring charges  and before the effects of purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
our goal is to develop and sell products that improve life science research and as such  we monitor our operating metrics and when appropriate  effect organizational changes to leverage infrastructure and distribution channels 
these changes may be effected as a result of various events  including acquisitions  the worldwide economy  general market conditions and personnel changes 
during  we entered into a million credit facility with brown brothers harriman co 
on december   we amended the terms of the credit facility 
the amended credit facility expires on december  under the terms of our credit facility  we will be required to obtain consent from our lenders upon the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment 
if we are unable to obtain this consent  the sale of the remaining portion of the capital equipment business segment will trigger a default under the credit facility whereby our lenders could accelerate all of the outstanding indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with financial covenants contained in the credit facility involving income  debt coverage and cash flow  as well as minimum working capital requirements 
additionally  the credit facility also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash  promissory notes and or other consideration in excess of million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of million 
we do not believe that these requirements will be a significant constraint on our operations or on the acquisition portion of our growth strategy 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility  an increase of approximately million from million as of december  the net increase in the credit facility resulted primarily from approximately million of borrowings to fund the acquisition of panlab 
as of december   we were not subject to any borrowing restrictions under the covenants and had available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
historically  we have funded acquisitions with debt  capital raised by issuing equity and cash flow from operations 
in order to continue the acquisition portion of our growth strategy beyond what our current cash balances and cash flow from operations can support we will need to raise more capital  either by incurring additional debt  issuing equity or a combination or through the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment 
to the extent we receive some or all of the proceeds in cash from the planned divestiture of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment  we intend to apply any cash proceeds to the repayment of debt  to continue our tuck under acquisition strategy within our apparatus and instrumentation business segment or to other general corporate purposes 
in the table below  we provide an overview of selected operating metrics 
of revenue of revenue of revenue in thousands total revenues cost of product revenues sales and marketing expenses general administrative expenses research development expense revenues 
we generate revenues by selling apparatus  instruments  devices and consumables through our catalog  our direct sales force  our distributors and our website 

table of contents for products primarily priced under  every one to three years  we typically distribute a new  comprehensive catalog initially in a series of bulk mailings  first to our existing customers  followed by mailings to targeted markets of potential customers 
over the life of the catalog  distribution will also be made periodically to potential and existing customers through direct mail and trade shows and in response to e mail and telephone inquiries 
from time to time  we also intend to distribute catalog supplements that promote selected areas of our catalog or new products to targeted subsets of our customer base 
future distributions of our comprehensive catalog and our catalog supplements will be determined primarily by the incidence of new product introductions  which cannot be predicted 
our end user customers are research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories 
revenue from catalog sales in any period is influenced by the amount of time elapsed since the last mailing of the catalog  the number of catalogs mailed and the number of new items included in the catalog 
we launched our latest comprehensive catalog in february  with approximately pages and approximately  copies printed 
revenues from direct sales to end users  derived through our catalog and the electronic version of our catalog on our website  represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
products sold under brand names of distributors including ge healthcare  are typically priced in the range of  they are mainly scientific instruments like spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a very wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus like gel electrophoresis units 
we also use distributors for both our catalog products and our higher priced products  for sales in locations where we do not have subsidiaries or where we have distributors in place for acquired businesses 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales to distributors 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from products we manufacture 
the remaining and  respectively  of our revenues for the years ended december  and  were derived from complementary products we distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed to conduct a particular experiment 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales made by our non us operations 
a large portion of our international sales during both and consisted of sales to ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences  the distributor for our spectrophotometers and plate readers 
ge healthcare distributes these products to customers around the world  including to many customers in the united states  from its distribution center in upsalla  sweden 
as a result  we believe our international sales would have been a lower percentage of our revenues if we had shipped our products directly to our end users 
changes in the relative proportion of our revenue sources between catalog sales  direct sales  and distribution sales are primarily the result of a different sales proportion of acquired companies 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging costs  warranty costs  shipping costs and royalties 
our cost of product revenues may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
we sell products that we manufacture and products that we purchase from third parties 
the products that we purchase from third parties have higher cost of goods sold because the profit is effectively shared with the original manufacturer 
we anticipate that our manufactured products will continue to have a lower cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenues as compared with the cost of non manufactured products for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our cost of product revenues as a percent of product revenues will vary based on mix of direct to end user sales and distributor sales  mix by product line and mix by geography 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human relations functions 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  restructuring costs  facility costs  investor relations  insurance and provision for doubtful accounts 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in sales  marketing and customer support functions 
we also incur costs for travel  trade shows  demonstration equipment  public relations and marketing materials  consisting primarily of the printing and distribution of our approximately page catalog  supplements and various other specialty catalogs  and the maintenance of our websites 
we may from time to time expand our marketing efforts by employing additional technical marketing specialists in an effort to increase sales of selected categories of products in our catalog 
we may also from time to time expand our direct sales organizations in an effort to increase and or support sales of our higher priced capital equipment instruments or to concentrate on key accounts or promote certain product lines 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and capital resources used to develop and enhance our products and to support collaboration agreements 
other research and development expense includes fees for consultants and outside service providers  and material costs for prototype and test units 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue to make these investments in order to realize the potential of new technologies that we develop  license or acquire 
stock compensation expenses

gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  compared with for the same period in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to sales from our panlab subsidiary  which sells at lower gross margins than our historical consolidated gross margins due to panlab s mix of distributed products compared to manufactured products  and from sales from our lower margin products and sales channels  primarily from our anthos product lines

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of common stock and preferred stock  and bank borrowings 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from investing activities  including funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in our consolidated statements of cash flows  we have elected to combine the cash flows from both continuing and discontinued operations within each category  as allowed by sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
unless specifically noted otherwise  our discussion of our cash flows below refers to combined cash flows from both continuing and discontinued operations

the increase in cash flow from operations from to was primarily the result of an increase in net income of million excluding non cash charges and other adjustments 
in addition  the remainder of the change was due to the timing of receipts and payments partially offset by an increase in inventories 
the increase in inventories was in anticipation of a full launch of new products introduced during  primarily our microliter spectrophotometer

in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both of which were part of our capital equipment business segment  to digilab  inc for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the net cash proceeds on the sale were million  as the million received from digilab was offset by million in cash that was held by our maia scientific subsidiary acquired by digilab 
the caption other investing activities primarily includes purchases of property  plant  and equipment 
we spent million during compared to million during for capital expenditures 
during the next twelve months  we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures 
our financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings and repayments under a revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman co  long term debt and the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  including the common stock issued in our initial public offering 
we ended and with million and million  respectively  drawn against our million revolving credit facility 
during  we entered into a million credit facility with brown brothers harriman co 
on december   we amended the terms of the credit facility 
this amendment changed the terms of our current million credit facility  by allowing borrowing of up to million in british pound sterling or eurocurrency and extending the maturity date from january  to december  the amended credit facility bears interest at either the base rate announced by bbh from time to time  the london interbank offered rate libor or the eurocurrency base rate  plus  in the case of libor or the eurocurrency base rate  a margin of or depending on our debt service leverage ratio 
as of december   we had million in eurocurrency loans outstanding bearing interest at a eurocurrency base rate equal to libor plus  which was equal to per annum 
as of december   we are in compliance with financial covenants contained in the credit facility involving income  debt coverage and cash flow  as well as minimum working capital requirements 
additionally  the credit facility also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash  promissory notes and or other consideration in excess of million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of million 
we do not believe that these requirements will be a significant constraint on our operations or on the acquisition portion of our growth strategy 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility  an increase of approximately million from million as of december  the net increase in the credit facility resulted primarily from approximately million of borrowings to fund the acquisition of panlab 
as of december   we were not subject to any borrowing restrictions under the covenants and had available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
under the terms of our credit facility  we will be required to obtain consent from our lenders upon the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment 
if we are unable to obtain this consent  the sale of the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment will trigger a default under the credit facility whereby our lenders could accelerate all of the outstanding indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
in connection with our acquisition of panlab  we assumed several working capital lines of credit totaling million 
the payment terms of the lines of credit are generally one year  however  the lines have historically renewed annually 
the interest rates  which include bank commissions and other fees  range between and 
there are no material financial covenants associated with these lines of credit 

table of contents our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
based on our current operations and current operating plans  we expect that our available cash  cash generated from current operations and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance current operations and capital expenditures for months and beyond 
however  we may use substantial amounts of capital to accelerate product development or expand our sales and marketing activities 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to make significant acquisitions 
additional capital raising activities will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we raise capital by issuing equity securities and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we believe that the absence of cash inflows from our discontinued businesses will not have an impact on our ability to support our current operations or operating plans 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following schedule represents our contractual obligations for our continuing and discontinued operations  excluding interest  as of december  total and beyond in thousands notes payable operating leases total critical accounting policies we believe that our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  inventory  valuation of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development in business combinations  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue of products when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales of some of our products include provisions to provide additional services such as installation and training 
we evaluate all sales with multiple deliverables  including our collaboration agreements  to determine if more than one unit of accounting exists  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when we determine that there is more than one unit of accounting  and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item s  we apply the residual method to allocate fair value 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
revenue for each unit of accounting is recorded once all applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service agreements on our equipment are typically sold separately from the sale of the equipment 
revenues on these service agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  typically one year  in accordance fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
we account for shipping and handling fees and costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which requires all amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling to be classified as revenues 
our costs incurred related to shipping and handling are classified as cost of product revenues 
warranties and product returns are estimated and accrued for at the time sales are recorded 
we have no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped or installed  if applicable  other than pursuant to warranty obligations and service or maintenance contracts 
we provide for the estimated amount of future returns upon shipment of products or installation  if applicable  based on historical experience 
historically  product returns and warranty costs have not been significant  and they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
we make estimates evaluating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
on an ongoing basis  we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historically  such credit losses have not been significant  and they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
accounting for income taxes 
we determine our annual income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves determining our current and deferred income tax expense as well as accounting for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the future tax consequences attributable to these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet this more likely than not standard as required in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  generally we allocate the related income tax expense to income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents management s judgment and estimates are required in determining our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance attributable to certain deferred tax assets as of december  that do not meet the more likely than not standard of realization based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the carryback and carryforward periods based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
we review the recoverability of deferred tax assets during each reporting period by reviewing estimates of future taxable income  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset before expiration 
we assess tax positions taken on tax returns  including recognition of potential interest and penalties  in accordance with the recognition thresholds and measurement attributes outlined in fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas interest and penalties recognized  if any  would be classified as a component of income tax expense 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase first in  first out method and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand 
since forecasted product demand quite often is a function of previous and current demand  a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change and new product development  and technological advances could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant adverse impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and acquired technology 
such intangible assets arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair market values 
amounts assigned to such identifiable intangible assets are primarily based on independent appraisals using established valuation techniques and management estimates 
the value assigned to trademarks was determined by estimating the royalty income that would be negotiated at an arm s length transaction if the asset were licensed from a third party 
a discount factor  ranging from to  which represents both the business and financial risks of such investments  was used to determine the present value of the future streams of income attributable to trademarks 
the specific approach used to value trademarks was the relief from royalty rfr method 
the rfr method assumes that an intangible asset is valuable because the owner of the asset avoids the cost of licensing that asset 
the royalty savings are then calculated by multiplying a royalty rate times a determined royalty base  ie  the applicable level of future revenues 
in determining an appropriate royalty rate  a sample of guideline  arm s length royalty and licensing agreements are analyzed 
in determining the royalty base  forecasts are used based on management s judgments of expected conditions and expected courses of actions 
the value assigned to acquired technology was determined by using a discounted cash flow model  which measures what a buyer would be willing to pay currently for the future cash stream potential of existing technology 
the specific method used to value the technologies involved estimating future cash flows to be derived as a direct result of those technologies  and discounting those future streams to their present value 
the discount factors used  ranging from to  reflect the business and financial risks of an investment in technologies 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on management s judgment of expected conditions and expected courses of action 

table of contents valuation of in process research and development acquired in business combinations 
purchase price allocation to in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of research and development projects that are reasonably believed to have no alternative future use 
the value assigned to in process research and development was determined by independent appraisals by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially feasible products  estimating the percentage of completion at the acquisition date  estimating the resulting net risk adjusted cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the discount rates used in determining the in process research and development expenditures reflects a higher risk of investment because of the higher level of uncertainty due in part to the nature of our business and the industry to constantly develop new technology for future product releases and ranged from to 
the forecasts used by us in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions we believed at the time to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
given the uncertainties of the development process  no assurance can be given that deviations from our estimates will not occur and no assurance can be given that the in process research and development projects identified will ever reach either technological or commercial success 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the value of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in who our competitors are and what they do  significant changes in our relationship with ge healthcare  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives was not recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors  then the recoverability of those assets to be held and used would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of those assets to undiscounted future net cash flows before tax effects expected to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
a long lived asset classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in the period the held for sale criteria are met  we recognize an impairment charge for any initial adjustment of the long lived assets 
during each reporting period after the initial measurement  gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in the fair value less costs to sell are recognized 
gains and losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of a long lived asset are recognized on the date of sale 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and long lived assets are no longer depreciated or amortized 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group  which are classified as held for sale  are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
operating results for all periods presented are presented as discontinued operations  net of tax 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 allocation of interest to discontinued operations  we have elected not to allocate interest of our consolidated debt to discontinued operations 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
for unamortizable intangible assets if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  we would write down the unamortizable intangible asset to fair value 

table of contents during the second quarter of  the asset groups that comprise our capital equipment business segment experienced a significant decrease in revenues and operating profit margins 
we believed the decrease in revenues was caused by a general market decrease in demand for capital equipment  excess capacity of certain genomics equipment in the market place  and new applications for certain products had not developed as previously anticipated 
these factors led us to revise our expectations of future revenues and operating profit margins for the capital equipment business segment 
as a result  with the assistance of third party independent appraisers  we re evaluated the long lived assets associated with these asset groups in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that certain intangible assets within these asset groups were impaired as of june  we used an income approach to determine the fair values of the long lived assets tested for impairment and recorded abandonment and impairment charges within the capital equipment business segment totaling approximately million for long lived assets during the second quarter of these abandonment and impairment charges have been classified within discontinued operations for the year ended december  also  as a result of the factors described above  in accordance with sfas no 
 we  with the assistance of third party independent appraisers  re evaluated the goodwill associated with the genomic solutions and union biometrica reporting units for impairment as of june  as a result of this goodwill impairment testing  we recorded impairment charges within the capital equipment business segment of approximately million for goodwill during the second quarter of we used a combination of an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of our genomic solutions and union biometrica reporting units 
these impairment charges have been classified within discontinued operations for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  certain product lines in the capital equipment business segment did not meet our revenue forecasts and expectations 
we believe that the further decline in revenues was due to the relative high price and nature of the products sold by capital equipment business segment which customers  particularly distributors  may not be promoting and purchasing due to the uncertain future of the business 
this led to a further reduction in our expectation of future revenues in the capital equipment business segment 
as a result  we re evaluated the goodwill included in this segment in accordance with sfas no 
 as well as the fair value of the disposal group in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  an additional goodwill impairment charge of approximately million and a write down of long lived assets of approximately million were recorded during the fourth quarter of we used a combination of income and market approaches to determine the fair value of the disposal group 
during the year ended december   we utilized a market approach and re evaluated the fair value less costs to sell of the assets that comprise the capital equipment business segment 
based on this evaluation  we recorded additional asset impairment charges of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we utilized a market approach and re evaluated the fair value less costs to sell of the assets that comprise the capital equipment business segment 
based on management s evaluation  additional asset impairment charges of approximately million were recorded during in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both of which were part of our capital equipment business segment  to digilab  inc the purchase price paid by digilab under the terms of the asset purchase agreement consisted of  in cash plus additional consideration in the form of an earn out based on of the revenue generated by the acquired business as it is conducted by digilab over a three year period post transaction 
any earn out amounts will be evidenced by interest bearing promissory notes due on november  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a loss on sale of million 
there was no value ascribed to the contingent consideration from the earn out agreement  as realization is uncertain 
the copas flow cytometry product line held by our union biometrica us and german subsidiaries  both of which are still included in discontinued operations  was not included in this sale  and we continue to pursue a sale of this product line separately

 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations when the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled or exceeded the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options or the employee stock purchase plan during the year ended december  because we had not adopted the recognition provisions under sfas no 
and there was no such expense under apb opinion no 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized includes compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no

stock based compensation expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to retain its method of valuation for stock based payment awards granted beginning in using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was also previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas no 
our determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
for awards granted prior to january   we use the accelerated expense recognition method in fin no

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that our revenues and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three years 
subsequent event on february   our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  initially  these rights will not be exercisable and will trade with the shares of our common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  the rights generally will become exercisable if a person becomes an acquiring person by acquiring or more of our common stock or if a person commences a tender offer that could result in that person owning or more of our common stock 
if a person becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right other than the acquiring person would be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  such number of shares of preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of our common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manufacture and test the majority of products in research centers in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  spain and austria 
we sell our products globally through our direct catalog sales  direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our financing activities 
as of december   we had million in eurocurrency loans outstanding bearing interest at a eurocurrency base rate equal to libor plus  which was equal to per annum 
assuming no other changes  which would affect the margin of the interest rate under our revolving credit facility  the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows if compared to the rate at december  interest expense increase in thousands interest rates increase by interest rates increase by under the current terms of our credit facility  we have the ability to borrow in us dollars  euros  or british pounds sterling 
on december   we had eurocurrency borrowings on our credit facility of million 
in addition  as of december   our recently acquired panlab subsidiary held notes payable of million denominated in euros 
these eurocurrency borrowings are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
a appreciation in year end currency exchange rates related to these eurocurrency borrowings would have resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange loss of million relating to our credit facility borrowings and an increase in the cumulative translation adjustments on our balance sheet of million relating to the notes held by our panlab subsidiary
