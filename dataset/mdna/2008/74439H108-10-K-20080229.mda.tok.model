item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview our business strategy is to acquire inpatient behavioral health care facilities and improve operating results within new and existing inpatient facilities and our other behavioral health care operations 
from to  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities 
during  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities in the acquisition of ardent health services  inc 
table of contents ardent behavioral and one other inpatient facility 
during  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities  including nine inpatient facilities with the acquisition of the capital stock of alternative behavioral services  inc abs on december  during  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities  including inpatient facilities in the acquisition of horizon health 
we strive to improve the operating results of new and existing inpatient behavioral health care operations by providing the highest quality service  expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives and meeting increased demand for behavioral health care services by expanding our services and developing new services 
we also attempt to improve operating results by optimizing staffing ratios  controlling contract labor costs and reducing supply costs through group purchasing 
our same facility revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  same facility growth in was primarily the result of increases in patient days and revenue per patient day of and  respectively 
same facility growth refers to the comparison of each inpatient facility owned during with the comparable period in  adjusted for closures and combinations for comparability purposes 
sources of revenue patient service revenue patient service revenue is generated by our inpatient facilities for services provided to patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis within the inpatient behavioral health care facility setting 
patient service revenue is recorded at our established billing rates less contractual adjustments 
generally  collection in full is not expected at our established billing rates 
contractual adjustments are recorded to state our patient service revenue at the amount we expect to collect for the services provided based on amounts reimbursable by medicare or medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third party payors at contractually determined rates 
patient service revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue in other revenue other behavioral health care services accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  this portion of our business primarily consists of our contract management and eap businesses 
our contract management business involves the development  organization and management of behavioral health care programs within medical surgical hospitals 
our eap business contracts with employers to assist employees and their dependents with resolution of behavioral conditions or other personal concerns 
services provided are recorded as revenue at contractually determined rates in the period the services are rendered  provided that collectability of such amounts is reasonably assured

table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at december  at december   we had million available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from the inpatient facilities offset by an increase in income tax payments and interest payments 
income tax payments in were reduced by our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax deductions generated by stock option exercises 
our operating loss carryforwards were substantially utilized in  and as a result  income tax payments moved closer to our provision for income taxes in interest payments in increased to million compared to million in primarily due to the increase in debt incurred to finance the acquisitions of abs and horizon health 
billings for patient accounts receivable are generally submitted to the payor within three days of the patient s discharge or completion of services 
interim billings may be utilized for patients with extended lengths of stay 
we verify within a reasonable period of time that claims submitted to third party payors have been received and are being processed by such payors 
follow up regarding the status of each claim is made on a periodic basis until payment on the claim is received 
billing notices for self pay accounts receivable are distributed on a periodic basis 
self pay accounts receivable are turned over to collection agencies once internal collection efforts have been exhausted 
accounts receivable under our inpatient management contracts are billed at least monthly 
follow up collection efforts are made on a periodic basis until payment is received 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient receivables primarily consists of patient accounts that are greater than days past the patient s discharge date 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables due under our inpatient management contracts primarily consists of amounts that are specifically identified as potential collection issues 
accounts receivable are written off when collection within a reasonable period of time is deemed unlikely 
cash used by continuing investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in investing activities in was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities and million paid for the purchases of fixed assets 
cash paid for acquisitions consisted primarily of the acquisition of horizon health 
cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we anticipate expansion expenditures to increase in as a result of planned capital expansion projects and the construction of new facilities  which are expected to add approximately new beds to our operations 
we define expansion capital expenditures as those that increase the capacity of our facilities or otherwise enhance revenue 
routine or maintenance capital expenditures were of our net revenue for cash used in investing activities in consisted primarily of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities and million paid for the purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in during  we borrowed an additional million under our senior secured term loan facility and used the net proceeds of our offering of million of 
notes to finance the majority of the horizon health acquisition and repurchase million of our notes 
we also had net repayments of million on our revolving credit facility and received million from issuances of our common stock from stock option exercises in cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million and million borrowed under our senior secured term loan facility and revolving credit facility  respectively  primarily to finance acquisitions 
we have a universal shelf registration statement on form s under which we may sell an indeterminate amount of our common stock  common stock warrants  preferred stock and debt securities 
we may from time to time offer these securities in one or more series  in amounts  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a credit worthy financial institution to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
with this interest swap arrangement we will exchange the interest payments associated with a notional amount of million of libor indexed variable rate debt related to our senior secured term loan for a fixed interest rate 
this interest rate swap arrangement matures on november  we expect a definitive agreement relating to the interest rate swap to be signed in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we terminated our interest rate swap agreements related to our notes 
we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities 
management continually assesses our capital needs and  should the need arise  we will seek additional financing  including debt or equity  to fund potential acquisitions  facility expansions or for other corporate purposes 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities

impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply costs  which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of the freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our swb expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payors 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses included in the financial statements 
estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available  the results of which form the basis of such estimates 
while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 

table of contents the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid  but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues 
as with our patient receivables  we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis by comparing our established billing rates with the amount we determine to be reimbursable given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
most payments are determined based on negotiated per diem rates 
while the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates  these differences are deemed immaterial 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management 
we periodically compare the contractual rates on our patient accounting systems with the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates or the third party payor contract for accuracy 
we also monitor the adequacy of our contractual adjustments using financial measures such as comparing cash receipts to net patient revenue adjusted for bad debt expense 
as of december   our patient accounts receivable balance for third party payors was million 
a theoretical change in the amounts due from third party payors at december  could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations 
the following table presents the percentage by payor of our net revenue and accounts receivable for the years ended december  and in thousands for the year ended december  net accounts net accounts revenue receivable revenue receivable payor mix medicaid commercial hmo private pay medicare state agency other total the following table presents the percentage by aging category of our accounts receivable at december  and in thousands at december  days days days days days days days total 
table of contents our consolidated day s sales outstanding were for the years ended december  and our consolidated collections as a percentage of net revenue less bad debt expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
at december   all of our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured limit of million 
the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are calculated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary 
this self insurance reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements  our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences 
the future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet 
management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and  if necessary  estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity 
to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity  then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  applying the provisions of fin requires significant judgments regarding the recognition and measurement of each tax position 
changes in these judgments may materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and our operating results 
share based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r under the modified prospective transition method on january   which requires us to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such awards 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options 
the black scholes model includes certain variables and assumptions that require judgment  such as the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected term of our stock options 
additionally  sfas r requires us to use judgment in the estimation of forfeitures over the vesting period of share based awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities and including our interest rate swap  approximately million of our long term debt outstanding at december  was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility  which had million outstanding at december  excluding million associated with our interest rate swap and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus  and our million revolving credit facility  which had a million balance outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain covenant ratio 
we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a creditworthy financial institution to exchange the interest payments associated with a notional amount of million of libor indexed variable rate debt for a fixed rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at december  in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and interest rates change significantly  we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change 
information on quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources
