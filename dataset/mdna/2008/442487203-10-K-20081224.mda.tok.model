item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning during the second half of our fiscal year ended october  and continuing through today  the u 
s 
housing market has been impacted by a lack of consumer confidence  increasing home foreclosure rates and large supplies of resale and new home inventories 
the result has been weakened demand for new homes  slower sales  higher than normal cancellation rates  and increased price discounts and other sales incentives to attract homebuyers 
additionally  the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained starting in february when the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize sub prime  alt a  and other non prime mortgage products 
the combination of these homebuilding industry and related mortgage financing developments resulted in significant decreases in our revenues and gross margins during and compared with prior years 
additionally  we incurred total land related charges of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
these charges resulted from the write off of deposit and preacquisition costs of million and million  respectively  related to land we no longer plan to pursue and impairments on owned inventory of million and million for the fiscal years ended october  and in addition to land related charges  the continued weakening of the market resulted in impairments of our intangible assets and goodwill of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
we have exposure to additional impairments of our inventories  which  as of october   have a book value of billion  net of million of impairments recorded on of our communities 
we also have million invested in  lots under option  including cash and letters of credit deposits of million as of october  we will record a write off for the amounts associated with an option if we determine it is probable we will not exercise it 
as of october   we have total investments in  and advances to  unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
each of our joint ventures assesses its inventory and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with us gaap  which has resulted in reductions in our investment in joint ventures of million from our second half of fiscal through october  we still have exposure to future write downs of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures if conditions continue to deteriorate in the markets that our joint ventures operate 
with respect to goodwill and intangibles  there is no remaining risk of further exposure to impairments because both goodwill and definite life intangibles have been fully written off as of october  we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term 
we have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline  reduce production volumes  and balance home price and profitability with sales pace 
we are delaying and cancelling planned land purchases and renegotiating land prices and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we are significantly reducing the number of speculative homes put into production 
while we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so  we currently anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in fiscal we have also closely evaluated and made reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses  reducing these expenses million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due in large part to a reduction head count from our peak in june given the persistence of these difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in the future 
critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements business combinations when we make an acquisition of another company  we use the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations sfas 
under sfas  we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received and there is no continued involvement 
in hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
additionally  in certain markets  we sell lots to customers  transferring title  collecting proceeds  and entering into contracts to build homes on these lots 
in these cases  we do not recognize the revenue from the lot sale until we deliver the completed home and have no continued involvement related to that home 
the cash received on the lot is recorded as a component of inventory until the revenue is recognized 
income recognition from high rise mid rise projects we are developing several high rise mid rise buildings that will take more than months to complete 
if these buildings qualify  revenues and costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with sfas under the percentage of completion method  revenues and costs are to be recognized when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of having a sufficient initial and continuing investment that the buyer cannot require to be refunded except for non delivery of the home  sufficient homes in the building have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales prices are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the building can be reasonably estimated 
we currently do not have any buildings that meet these criteria  therefore the revenues from delivering homes in high rise mid rise buildings are recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing involvement have been received and there is no continued involvement with respect to that home 
income recognition from mortgage loans our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
we use mandatory mortgage backed securities mbs forward commitments and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks  federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forward commitments 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to the marketability and disposal of non agency and non governmental loans  including alt a fico scores below and depending on credit criteria and sub prime loans fico scores below and depending on credit criteria  we require our financial services segment to either presell or broker all of these loans  on an individual loan basis as soon as they are committed to by the customer 
however  because of the recent tightening by mortgage lenders  our origination of alt a and sub prime loans has declined to only and  respectively  of the total loans we originated during fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  for the same period last year 
in addition  of the million of mortgage loans held for sale as of october   none were alt a or sub prime loans 
there were  however  million of mortgage loans held for investment at october   which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
as alt a and sub prime originations declined  we have seen an increase in our level of federal housing administration and veterans administration fha va loan origination 
for the twelve months ended october  and  fha va loans represented and  respectively  of our total loans 
profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
interest income recognition for mortgage loans receivable and recognition of related deferred fees and costs interest income is recognized as earned for each mortgage loan during the period from the loan closing date to the sale date when legal control passes to the buyer  and the sale price is collected 
all fees related to the origination of mortgage loans and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recorded as either a an adjustment to the related mortgage loans upon the closing of a loan or b recognized as a deferred asset or deferred revenue while the loan is in process 
these fees and costs include loan origination fees  loan discount  and salaries and wages 
such deferred fees and costs relating to the closed loans are recognized over the life of the loans as an adjustment of yield or taken into operations upon sale of the loan to a permanent investor 
inventories inventories consist of land  land development  home construction costs  capitalized interest and construction overhead and are stated at cost  net of impairment losses  if any 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
we report inventories in our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or fair value 
our inventories consist of the following three components sold and unsold homes and lots under development  which includes all construction  land  and hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents land development costs related to started homes and land under development in our active communities  land and land options held for future development or sale  which includes all costs related to land in our communities in planning  and consolidated inventory not owned  which includes all cost related to specific performance options  variable interest entities  and other options  which consists primarily of our gmac model homes and inventory related to structured lot options 
as a result of the declining homebuilding market  we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities where we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
as of october   the book value associated with the mothballed communities was million  net of an impairment balance of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
the recoverability of inventories and other long lived assets are assessed in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires long lived assets  including inventories  held for development to be evaluated for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows of the assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
as such  we evaluate inventories for impairment at the individual community level  the lowest level of discrete cash flows that we measure 
we evaluate inventories of communities under development and held for future development for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in local housing market values  decreases in gross margins or sales absorption rates  decreases in net sales prices base sales price net of sales incentives  or actual or projected operating or cash flow losses 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly  primarily by completing detailed budgets for all of our communities and identifying those communities with a projected operating loss for any projected fiscal year or for the entire projected community life 
for those communities with projected losses  we estimate remaining undiscounted future cash flows and compare those to the carrying value of the community  to determine if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable 
the projected operating profits  losses or cash flows of each community can be significantly impacted by our estimates of the following future base selling prices  future home sales incentives  future home construction and land development costs  and future sales absorption pace and cancellation rates 
these estimates are dependent upon specific market conditions for each community 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a quarterly reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
local market specific conditions that may impact our estimates for a community include the intensity of competition within a market  including publicly available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors  the current sales absorption pace for both our communities and competitor communities  community specific attributes  such as location  availability of lots in the market  desirability and uniqueness of our community  and the size and style of homes currently being offered  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  changes by management in the sales strategy of the community  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by management in preparing projection assumptions for each community 
the sales objectives can differ between our communities  even within a given market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
in addition  the key assumptions included in our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in homes sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace and selling strategies  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful to an investor 
hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents if the undiscounted cash flows are more than the carrying value of the community  then the carrying amount is recoverable  and no impairment adjustment is required 
however  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then the community is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each community by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the respective community 
our discount rates used for the impairments recorded to date range from to 
the estimated future cash flow assumptions are the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
inventories held for sale  which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes  are a very small portion of our total inventories  and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining whether land held for sale is impaired  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  if available 
from time to time  we write off deposits and approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs when we decide not to exercise options to buy land in various locations or when we redesign communities and or abandon certain engineering costs 
in deciding not to exercise a land option  we take into consideration changes in market conditions  the timing of required land takedowns  the willingness of land sellers to modify terms of the land option contract including timing of land takedowns  and the availability and best use of our capital  among other factors 
the write off is recorded in the period it is deemed probable that the optioned property will not be acquired 
in certain instances  we have been able to recover deposits and other preacquisition costs which were previously written off 
these recoveries are generally not significant in comparison to the total costs written off 
the impairment of communities under development and held for future development and inventories held for sale  and the charge for land option write offs  are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in a separate line entitled homebuilding inventory impairment loss and land option write offs 
see also the results of operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements for inventory impairment and write off amounts by segment 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible is million per occurrence with an aggregate million for liability claims and an aggregate million for construction defect claims under our general liability insurance 
our worker s compensation insurance deductible is million per occurrence in fiscal and fiscal reserves have been established based upon actuarial analysis of estimated losses for fiscal and fiscal we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty data to estimate our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and workers compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
interest in accordance with sfas  capitalization of interest cost  interest incurred is first capitalized to properties under development during the land development and home construction period and expensed along with the associated cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
interest incurred in excess of interest capitalized because qualifying assets for interest capitalization are less than debt  or interest incurred on borrowings directly related to properties not under development are expensed immediately in other interest 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option

unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interest in joint ventures varies but is generally less than or equal to 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we consider the guidance in eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  in assessing whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agreements require that both partners agree on establishing the operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb  we assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability  and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary  we write down the investment to the recoverable value 
we evaluate our equity investments for recoverability based on the joint venture s projected cash flows 
in fiscal  we wrote down certain joint venture investments by million  based on this recoverability analysis 
intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our october  balance sheet are goodwill  which has an indefinite life  and definite life intangibles  including trade names  architectural designs  distribution processes  and contractual agreements resulting from our acquisitions 
we no longer amortize goodwill but instead assess it periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october  if the fair value of the applicable business unit is less than the carrying amount of that business unit  the goodwill of that business unit is considered impaired 
the amount of the impairment is determined as the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill  and the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
that is  the fair value of the business unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that business unit as if the business unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of a business unit are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments 
this was the case in fiscal  whereby we wrote off the remaining million of goodwill balance based upon present value cash flow analyses  bringing the balance to zero at october  the goodwill impairment charge was included in goodwill and intangible amortization and impairment on the consolidated statements of operations 
we also assess definite life intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an intangible impairment is recorded when events and circumstances indicate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from the business unit with the intangible asset are less than the net assets of the business unit 
the impairment loss is the lesser of the difference between the net assets of the business unit and the discounted future cash flows generated from the applicable business unit  which approximates fair value and the intangible asset balance 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of a business unit are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments 
this was the case in fiscal  whereby we wrote off million of intangible assets carrying amount  bringing the balance to zero at october  in fiscal  we determined that the intangible assets associated with our fort myers  california  tampa  orlando  canton and building products operations were impaired and wrote them off for a total reduction of million  of which million was included in goodwill and intangible amortization and impairment on the consolidated statement of operations and million was included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the intangible impairment charge is included in goodwill and intangible amortization and impairment on the consolidated statements of operations

table of contents post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
in addition  we accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for repair costs under  per occurrence to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs over  per occurrence as part of our general liability insurance deductible expensed as selling  general and administrative costs 
as previously stated  the deductible for our general liability insurance for homes delivered in fiscal and is million per occurrence with an aggregate million for liability claims  and an aggregate million for construction defect claims 
both of these liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes or income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required

in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  and were for operating expenses  construction  state income taxes  and interest 
we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand  housing and land sales  the issuance of million of senior secured second lien notes senior secured notes  the issuance of million shares of class a common stock  the revolving credit facility  financial service revenues  a federal tax refund and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs  despite continued declines in total revenues and a reduction in the availability under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  we are focused on maximizing cash flow  even at the expense of lower gross margins  by limiting investments in new communities and delaying further investment in current communities thereby reducing our inventory as we continue to build and deliver homes from our current communities 
in addition  we anticipate receiving a federal tax refund in fiscal of million 
we may also enter into land sale agreements or joint ventures to generate cash from our existing balance sheet 
on december   we issued million of senior secured notes in exchange for million of our unsecured senior notes 
on may   we issued million of senior secured notes  and the amendment to the seventh amended and restated credit agreement  which reduced the aggregate amount of commitments from million to million  became effective 
availability under the amended credit agreement equals the lesser of million and the amount available pursuant to the borrowing base and the sub limit for revolving loans is million 
the amended credit agreement eliminated all but one of the financial maintenance covenants  which requires that as of the last day of each fiscal quarter either the ratio of our adjusted operating cash flow to fixed charges exceed to or our liquidity  as defined in the amended credit agreement  equals or exceeds million 
because of our million of homebuilding cash at october  and our expectations of cash flows in fiscal  we believe we will be in compliance with this new covenant through our net loss income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net loss income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of definite life intangibles  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory  definite life intangibles and goodwill 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal  inventory levels  prepaids and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increase  but for cash flow purposes are offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what has been happening since the last half of fiscal allowing us to generate positive cash flow from operations during this period 
looking forward  given the continued deterioration in the housing market  it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow 
however  we will continue to make adjustments to our structure and our business plans in order to maximize our liquidity

total inventory decreased billion  excluding inventory not owned  during the fiscal year ended october  this decrease excluded the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with sfas  sfas  and eitf  and variable interest entities in accordance with fin r 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information on fin r 
total inventory decreased in the northeast million  in the mid atlantic million  in the midwest million  in the southeast million  in the southwest million  and in the west million 
these decreases were due to decisions to delay or terminate new communities  as well as slow spending in current communities and due to inventory impairments recorded in these segments 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next months 
most inventory completed or under development was is partially financed through our line of credit  preferred stock and senior secured  senior and senior subordinated indebtedness 
despite the decrease in total inventory  our inventory representing land and land options held for future development or sale on the consolidated balance sheets increased by million compared to october  the increase is due to sold and unsold home and lots under development inventory being reclassified to land and land options held for future development or sale inventory when we decide to mothball or stop development on a community 
we mothball communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
that is  we believe we will generate higher returns if we avoid spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such times as the markets improve 
as of october   we have mothballed land in communities 
the book value associated with these communities at october  was million  net of an impairment balance of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
inventory impairment losses  which include inventory that has been written off or written down  increased million for the fiscal year ended october   compared to the prior year 
during the fiscal year  we incurred million in write downs primarily attributable to impairments as a result of a continued decline in sales pace  sales price and general market conditions  as well as increased cancellation rates 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during the fiscal year ended october  the following table summarizes home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the decrease in total home sites available in compared to is partially attributable to terminating certain option agreements  as discussed herein

investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  a significant portion of the decrease is the result of consolidating a previously unconsolidated land development joint venture in our west segment  when our partner in the joint venture decided to terminate its investment 
there was no debt associated with this joint venture and no further financial obligations required from us 
however  we will be responsible for property taxes on the land previously owned by the joint venture going forward 
upon consolidating  no additional funds were invested in this land  as we had already invested the money in the lots via our investment in the joint venture 
we decided not to walk away from the land investment of the joint venture because we believe we will be able to recover a portion of the original basis  whether or not developed 
because of the consolidation  we now own hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents the lots outright and they are included in our consolidated lot count 
this resulted in reclassing million investment in this joint venture to inventory 
this inventory was subsequently impaired by million in the fourth quarter of and we have mothballed the community for the time being 
also contributing to the decrease in investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures are distributions received from joint ventures and losses incurred by joint ventures  primarily related to inventory impairments and land option and walk away costs during fiscal  partially offset by increases resulting from joint venture income not distributed and additional investments in joint ventures 
as of october   we have investments in ten homebuilding joint ventures and seven land development joint ventures 
other than guarantees limited only to completion of development  environmental indemnification and standard indemnification for fraud and misrepresentation including voluntary bankruptcy  we have no guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures 
receivables  deposits and notes decreased million to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to the receipt of cash of million from insurance carriers related to outstanding warranty claims  as well as the return of refundable deposits as we complete communities and the required land development 
property  plant and equipment decreased million primarily due to depreciation and disposals  which were not offset by additions during the period as we elected to reduce our investment in new property  plant and equipment in the current market environment 
prepaid expenses and other assets are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance prepaid project costs senior residential rental properties other prepaids other assets total prepaid insurance increased slightly due to the timing of payments for insurance premium costs 
these costs are amortized over the life of the associated insurance policy 
prepaid project costs decreased for homes delivered and have not been replenished  as we have reduced the number of active selling communities given the current homebuilding environment 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
other prepaids increased primarily as a result of fees paid in connection with the issuance of the million senior secured notes due in may this increase was partially offset by a decrease for bank fees paid in connection with the entering into the seventh amended and restated credit agreement in march  which normally would be amortized over the loan period 
because we amended and reduced the aggregate commitment of the facility effective may   we wrote off a significant portion of these bank fees in the third quarter of fiscal other assets decreased because there were significant distributions in the first quarter from our executive deferred compensation plan 
these distributions also resulted in a corresponding decrease in accrued compensation discussed below under accounts payable and other liabilities 
at october   we had million of goodwill 
this amount resulted from company acquisitions prior to fiscal as required by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we performed an annual assessment of this goodwill for impairment  and despite years of significant income generation in the markets with goodwill  primarily texas in the southwest segment and the mid atlantic segment  the current financial projections of these markets has resulted in a full impairment of existing goodwill 
as such  as of october   the goodwill balance is zero 
the impairment was written off in the line goodwill and intangible amortization and impairment on the consolidated statement of operations 
definite life intangibles decreased million to zero at october  the decrease was the result of amortization during the twelve months of million  and the write off of million for impaired intangible assets 
in fiscal  we determined that the remaining intangible assets in our mid atlantic and southeast segments were impaired  and wrote off the assets accordingly 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale or investment consist primarily of residential mortgages receivable held for sale of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
also included are residential mortgages receivable held for investment of million and million at october  and october   which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
we have reserves for potential losses on mortgages we currently hold 
the decrease in the receivable from october  is directly related to hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents a decrease in the amount of loans financed at october  as compared to october  income taxes receivable decreased million from october  to million 
the decrease is primarily due to the receipt of our federal tax refund for fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal of million  offset by the current tax receivable which can be carried back to the recoverability of the tax asset is limited to the use of loss carrybacks to and existing deferred tax liabilities 
see total taxes later in item for further discussion of the valuation allowances recorded during fiscal accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable reserves accrued expenses accrued compensation other liabilities total the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the lower volume of deliveries in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
the decrease in accrued expenses is primarily due to payments made for land options with letters of credit that were terminated and accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in accrued compensation was primarily due to the significant distributions in the first quarter from our executive deferred compensation plan as well as lower bonus accruals at october  compared to october  the decrease in other liabilities is primarily related to accrued costs paid for resolution of matter with respect to our fort myers operations  and the final scheduled payment associated with a acquisition  offset by an increase in deferred revenue on gmac model homes 
nonrecourse land mortgages decreased million from october  to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to purchase money mortgages for a property in our mid atlantic segment that were paid during fiscal customer deposits decreased million from october  to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the number of homes in backlog from  at october  to  at october  mortgage warehouse line of credit under our secured master repurchase agreement decreased million from million at october  to million at october  the decrease is directly correlated to the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale from october  to october  liabilities from inventory not owned and minority interest from inventory not owned decreased million and million  respectively  from million and million  respectively  at october  to million and million at october   respectively 
these decreases are directly correlated to the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned on the consolidated balance sheets  which is discussed above 
accrued interest increased million from million at october  to million at october  the increase is primarily due to interest on our new million senior secured notes due results of operations total revenues compared to the same prior period  revenues increased decreased as follows year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  homebuilding sale of homes land sales other revenues financial services total change total revenues percent change homebuilding compared to the same prior period  housing revenues decreased  million  or  for the year ended october   decreased  million  or  for the year ended october   and increased million or  for the year ended october  increases in were the result of both organic growth and acquisition of other homebuilders

table of contents quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by a slow down in sales and an increase in our cancellation rates over the past two years  due to weakening market conditions and tighter mortgage loan underwriting criteria 
cancellation rates represent the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
the more recent spike in the fourth quarter of fiscal cancellation rate  we believe  is partially due to the significant financial market turmoil that began in mid september quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of beginning backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth historically  most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks 
cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer s failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  in and  we have experienced a higher than normal number of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations are related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by us or other builders  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria leading to some customer s inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases  the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenues 
we expect that cancellation rates will return to a more normal level at some point as prices stabilize  but it is difficult to predict when this will occur  and the timing will vary by market 
an important indicator of our future results is recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  using base hovnanian enterprises  inc

as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margins  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges decreased to for the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year 
continued declines in percentages in fiscal are primarily the result of decreased sales prices and increased buyer concessions 
the declining pace of sales in our markets in  and has led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we have increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  as well as lowered some base prices  all of which have impacted our margins significantly 
in addition  homes for which contracts have been cancelled have typically been resold at a lower price  resulting in a further decline in margins 
as discussed in homebuilding results by segment below  certain of our segments experienced increases in average selling prices for the year ended october  compared to it should be noted however  that these increases are primarily the result of geographic and community mix of our deliveries  rather than an ability to increase home prices 
reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional discussion 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering cost are written off 
option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s proforma profitability does not produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments 
the impairments amounting to million  million and million for the years ending october   and  respectively  were incurred because of recent changes in the value of land in many of our markets and a change in the market strategy to liquidate a particular property or lower sales prices 
below is a break down of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal in  in total  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that remain economically feasible  including a substantial number that were successfully renegotiated over the past year

also adding to the decrease is the reduction in the number of open for sale communities of in fiscal from in fiscal land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales

profits from land sales for the year ended october  were less than for the year ended october  although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult

total taxes total tax provision benefit as a percentage of the loss before taxes was for the twelve months ended october  the rate was significantly below the statutory tax rate  because we recorded an additional million charge to our current and deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the twelve months ended october   as discussed further below 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
sfas requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during and  resulting in additional inventory and intangible impairments  we are now in a three year cumulative loss position 
according to sfas  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance for current and deferred taxes increased million during the twelve months ended october   to million at october  our deferred tax assets at october  and october   for which there is no valuation allowance  relate to amounts that can be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through carrybacks to the and years 
off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of million 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the million in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million  which is the purchase price for these lots net of cash deposits already paid  is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities vie  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under fin r  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
since we do not own an equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin r  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been based on the hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
at october   the balance reported in minority interest from inventory not owned was million 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vies  if any  have no recourse against us 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total represents our senior secured  senior and senior subordinated notes  other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of the debt of  million 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the exchange offer completed in december represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
recently in the more highly regulated markets that have seen significant home price appreciation  customer affordability has become a concern 
our broad product array insulates us to some extent  but customer affordability of our homes is something we monitor closely 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales 
mergers and acquisitions on april   we acquired for cash the assets of craftbuilt homes  a privately held homebuilder headquartered in bluffton  south carolina 
the acquisition expands our operations into the coastal markets of south carolina and georgia 
craftbuilt homes designs  markets and sells single family detached homes 
due to its close proximity to hilton head  craftbuilt homes focuses on first time  move up  empty nester and retiree homebuyers 
this acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase with the results of its operations included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition 
in connection with the craftbuilt homes acquisition  we have definite life intangible assets equal to the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible assets of million in aggregate 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that these assets were impaired and wrote off the remaining asset balance of million 
prior to the impairment  we were amortizing the definite life intangibles over their estimated lives 
on may   we acquired through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock substantially all of the assets of two mechanical contracting businesses 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases with the results of their operations included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition 
in connection with the two mechanical contracting business acquisitions  we recorded definite life intangible assets equal to the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible assets of million in aggregate 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we hovnanian enterprises  inc 
table of contents determined that these intangible assets were impaired and wrote off the remaining asset balance of million 
prior to the impairment  we were amortizing the definite life intangibles over their estimated lives 
all fiscal acquisitions provide for other payments to be made  generally dependant upon achievement of certain future operating and return objectives  however  we do not expect to make any future payments based on our forecasts for these businesses

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit under our secured master repurchase agreement are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk except with respect to mortgage loans 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but we do not believe this risk is material

see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the exchange offer completed in december in addition  we have reassessed the market risk for our variable debt at october  under the terms of the may amended credit agreement  under which interest is based on one  two  three or six month libor  plus  a base rate equal to the greater of pnc bank  national association s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus  plus or an index rate based on daily libor  plus 
we believe that a increase in this rate would have resulted in an approximate million increase in interest expense for the twelve months ended october   assuming an average of million of variable rate debt outstanding from november  to october
