this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report 
we recycle  manufacture  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our business is organized into the following five segments americas recycling  americas mills  americas fabrication and distribution  international mills and international fabrication and distribution 
our domestic and international distribution business activities consist only of physical transactions and not speculation 
americas recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of texas  oklahoma  kansas  louisiana  alabama  arkansas  missouri  georgia  tennessee  florida  south carolina  and north carolina 
americas mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  and a copper tube minimill 
our copper tube minimill is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics 
americas fabrication and distribution operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut  fabricate  distribute and place steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce special sections for floors and support for ceilings and floors  
table of contents plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility 
additionally  our domestic distribution consists of our cmc dallas trading division which markets and distributes semi finished long and flat steel products into the americas from a diverse base of international and domestic sources 
international mills operations international mills includes our polish cmcz and croatian cmcs mills and have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of the market and the regulatory environment in which our international mills operate is different from our domestic minimills 
we conduct our international mill operations through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar and some merchant products  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  and an electronic arc furnace based steel pipe manufacturer 
international fabrication and distribution operations we conduct our international fabrication operations through three steel fabrication plants in europe primarily for reinforcing bar and mesh 
additionally  we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures internationally 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are received based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the calculated loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
we account for large fabrication projects in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we estimate our interim lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at quarter end and recording the resulting lifo expense in its entirety 
inventory cost for international and remaining inventories is determined by the first in  first out method  or fifo 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our domestic and international mills  fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo effect on net earnings per diluted share excludes the net sales of a division classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the years ended august in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda loss from discontinued operations ebitda from continuing operations 
table of contents ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to partially finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
the following events and performances had a significant financial impact during as compared to or are significant for our future operations we reported our highest net sales ever for the fifth straight year 
we recorded after tax lifo expense of million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in we experienced favorable foreign exchange rates during as compared to which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 
net sales of the americas recycling segment increased and adjusted operating income increased driven by higher scrap prices  primarily ferrous scrap 
net sales of the americas mills segment increased but adjusted operating income decreased primarily caused by lifo expense of million during as compared to expense of million during our americas fabrication and distribution segment s results were impacted by escalating steel prices and a margin compression due to fixed price contracts which resulted in an adjusted operating loss of million including lifo expense of million and job loss reserves of million 
our international mills segment reported adjusted operating income of million in as compared to million in prior year 
our polish mill experienced an increase in adjusted operating profit of offset by losses at our mill in croatia which continued to be saddled with start up costs 
our international fabrication and distribution segment set an all time record for adjusted operating profit of million  a increase from prior year  driven by strong pricing internationally 
seven acquisitions with a total purchase price of million were completed during expense of million and capital expenditures of million were recorded during as compared to expense of million and capital expenditures of million recorded during related to the global implementation of sap 
treasury shares purchased by the company during increased diluted earnings per share by 
our overall effective tax rate decreased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit is the sum of our earnings before income taxes and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for americas mills and americas fabrication and distribution segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication and distribution international mills international fabrication and distribution corporate eliminations discontinued operations adjusted operating profit loss americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication and distribution international mills international fabrication and distribution corporate eliminations discontinued operations lifo impact on adjusted operating profit lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from net income 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from net income 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve 
international mills is not included in this table as it uses fifo valuation exclusively for its inventory three months ended twelve months ended august  august  in thousands americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication and distribution international fabrication and distribution consolidated increase decrease to adjusted profit before tax lifo income or expense includes a division classified as discontinued operations 
compared to americas recycling this segment had record sales and adjusted operating profit in which was driven by higher scrap prices  primarily ferrous 
the record adjusted operating income of million was strong enough to overcome lifo expense of million in compared to million in spurred by ferrous price increases  our ferrous scrap operations accounted for three fourths of the segment s profitability 
the average ferrous scrap sales price increased and shipments increased compared to although lower than ferrous scrap  the average sales price of nonferrous scrap increased but shipments decreased due to 
table of contents continued weak residential markets and lower manufacturing output

the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per short ton and tons shipped in thousands for the years ended august increase decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped americas mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in this segment 
while resulted in record sales for this segment  adjusted operating profit decreased from resulting from a significant increase in lifo expense due to spiking ferrous scrap prices 
this segment had lifo expense of million  an increase of million over within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for as compared to million for the decrease in adjusted operating profit was mainly due to additional lifo expense of million recorded during as compared to metal margins were higher as weighted average sales prices barely stayed ahead of rapidly increasing ferrous scrap prices 
the price of ferrous scrap consumed rose compared to the increase in ferrous scrap prices drove the average selling price up per ton while the average selling price for finished goods increased per ton 
margins were negatively impacted by a increase in alloys and electrodes and a increase in energy cost during as compared to combined  these two costs accounted for an increase of million 
sales volumes increased to million tons  an all time record  while tonnage rolled increased to million tons

lifo expense was million for as compared to million in the prior year 
we also recorded job loss reserves of million during based on our estimate of fixed rate contracts 
the composite average selling price increased  however  the overall job mix represented by the backlog did not have sufficient time to rollover to higher prices to match the increase in steel finished goods 
these negative results were offset by an million litigation settlement we received during the third quarter of related to costs incurred on a large structural fabrication job in an operating unit we sold several years ago

we are near completion  with startup expected in october of  of our new finishing end to our wire rod block which will enable us to roll higher value products 
also  during  we began the installation of a completely new rolling mill in zawiercie designed to allow efficient and flexible production of an increased medium section product range 
this major strategic expansion captures the full advantage of the underutilized melting capacity of cmcz s two existing electric arc furnaces 
cmcs reported an adjusted operating loss of million during due to start up costs and regaining customer acceptance

international fabrication and distribution net sales for increased  impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 
adjusted operating income increased to million  this segment s all time record  driven by strong pricing in the middle east  north africa  and central europe  and with the german economy growing at its fastest rate in a decade 
our australian operations performed well as the domestic economy remains strong and commodity prices remain high 
our raw materials division set a record for sales and operating profit in with china reducing export tonnages  prices in southeast asia have risen and profits in inter asian trade remained positive 
in august  cmc s board approved the plan to offer to sell a division which is involved with the buying  selling and distribution of nonferrous metals 
the sale has not been completed as of august   however  we expect the majority of product lines of this division to be sold and the remaining product lines to be absorbed by our other divisions in see note  discontinued operations and impairments  to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate our corporate expenses for increased million over the prior year due primarily to an increase of million in costs incurred for our investment in the global installation of sap software

outlook fiscal will be a challenge to many businesses  including cmc 
the turmoil in global financial markets  the uncertainty of the effects of government intervention  the imminent change in the us administration and a loss of confidence by both consumers and investors clouds our outlook 
in the short term we will face headwinds until such time as confidence and credit liquidity issues are stabilized 
prices for our metals products have recently declined  some sharply 
in periods of declining prices  customers typically withhold orders waiting to see signals that the market has bottomed 
this will translate into lower volumes in most segments 
we will adjust our production to meet demand  manage inventories  and maintain metal margins  downtime will be devoted to maintenance and upgrades 
there are bright spots fabrication operations will benefit from lower finished goods prices  easing their margin compression 
forward order books for certain distribution operations should result in good profitability 
long term we continue to see strong demand for steel and related products as the emerging economies urbanize industrialize 
global infrastructure projects should continue to be a key driver of demand 
compared to americas recycling fiscal had record sales but adjusted operating profit in was lower as compared to as margins were squeezed 
the average selling price of ferrous scrap remained strong with a increase over the average selling price of nonferrous for increased over prices 
volume was also up in with a increase in ferrous tons shipped and a increase in nonferrous tons shipped

while set many benchmarks  record average selling prices and increased metal margins at the mills in helped to produce our second best year ever 
metal margins the difference between the average selling price and cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 
despite record high sales prices  increases in the scrap purchase cost and lower sales volume reduced our metal margins at our copper tube minimill 
lifo expense for was million as compared million for within the segment adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to  however slowing market conditions in the fourth quarter compelled the mills to curtail production in order to lower finished goods inventories 
higher selling prices did not fully offset lower tons shipped resulting in sales slightly decreasing in versus average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year as the world demand for ferrous scrap remained strong

on a full year basis  electricity costs decreased by million and natural gas costs decreased by million 
year over year costs for ferroalloys  graphite electrodes and other supplies increased  while transportation rates rose significantly 
electrode costs per ton were up with the largest increase at cmc steel south carolina 
our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million for the year ended august  compared to million for while selling prices set another record high  our results were adversely impacted by lower shipment volumes and lower metal margins compared to the decline in housing starts coupled with the extraordinary high price of copper reduced the demand for copper plumbing tube across the us we matched production and inventory levels to coincide with order intake levels 
we were able to increase the average selling price for the year to per pound  a historical high  however metal spreads narrowed to per pound due to the increase in the cost of copper scrap and lower production volumes

metal margins increased over driven by increases in prices but partially offset by increases in the ferrous scrap cost 
operating levels and shipments were also up compared to  including a increase in shipments 
a strong polish zloty encouraged steel imports and made exports difficult 
steel imports were particularly high in the second half of the year 
during fiscal our new scrap mega shredder in zawiercie was very successful and enabled us to sustain higher melt shop yields and lower melt shop costs 
in march of  we purchased all the shares of cmcz owned by the polish ministry of state treasury approximately of the outstanding shares

steel tonnage increased in most of our markets  especially sales into the us  although sales dollars were mixed in various markets 
us steel import volumes and operating profits were strong although varied by product line 
international steel markets remained vibrant with increased pricing from the prior year 
the increase in chinese exports gave us additional sourcing opportunities in inter asia carbon steel products

liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities we could be adversely affected if our banks  the buyers of our commercial paper or other of the traditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refused to honor their contract commitments or ceased lending 
while we believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially capable  recent events in the global credit markets  including the failure  takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions  have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades

we may sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
our domestic securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants that conform to the same requirements contained in our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we used million of net cash flows from operating activities as compared to generating million in this change is primarily the result of a decrease in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of million and an increase in cash used for working capital of million 
the increase in cash used for working capital mainly relates to the following increased accounts receivable increased sales and increased ferrous prices as compared to the same period last year and fewer sales of accounts receivable  increased inventories increased inventory on hand and higher inventory costs primarily due to increased ferrous prices  and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses provided a source of cash as these current liabilities increased due to higher volume 
during  we used million of net cash flows from investing activities as compared to million in we invested million in property  plant and equipment during  an increase of million 
the significant capital expenditures in related to the construction of the new micro mill in arizona  the installation of a new wire rod block and rolling mill at cmcz and capitalization of cost associated with the global implementation of sap 
additionally  we spent million for the acquisitions of businesses  an increase of million 
in comparison  during we used million of cash to acquire the minority shares of cmcz from the polish government and other minority shareholders 
net cash flow from financing activities provided million for as compared to million for the increase was mainly driven by an increase in documentary letters of credit and proceeds from short term borrowings and long term debt 
we issued million of long term notes in as compared to million in during  we used million to purchase million shares of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program  an increase of million over additionally  we increased our dividend rate to cents per share during which resulted in an increase of cash used of million over our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of billion are typically expenditures with normal revenue processing activities

contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 

table of contents environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at thirteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we had million accrued for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with eight of the thirteen cercla sites 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to reasonably estimate an amount for the five other cercla sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these thirteen sites for the years ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 

table of contents in  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
during  million of our capital expenditures related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the company or its subsidiaries 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
natural gas we enter into natural gas forward contracts as economic hedges of the company s americas mills operations based on anticipated consumption of natural gas 
interest rates if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt and the fair value of our long term debt would be approximately million and million  respectively
