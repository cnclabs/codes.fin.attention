overview we are a pioneer and market leader in internet protocol telephony systems for small to medium sized businesses 
we design  manufacture and market next generation  internet protocol phone systems and contact centers that use both the internet and the public telephone network to take advantage of the convergence of voice and data communications 
unlike traditional proprietary phone systems  our systems are designed with open architecture and are built on an industry standard platform 
this adherence to industry standards allows our products to play an important role in the small to medium sized business market by delivering phone systems that can integrate with other technologies and provide integrated voice and data solutions  which enables our customers to implement communication systems that have an increased return on investment 
we generated net revenue of million  for a net loss of million  during fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year we derive our revenue from sales of our telephone systems 
product revenue is comprised of direct sales to end users and resellers and sales to distributors 
revenue from product sales to end users and resellers are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we also provide a reserve for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right  in certain circumstances  to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we provide distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to the manufacturing of our products 
several factors that have affected and will continue to affect our revenue growth are the state of the economy  the market acceptance of our products  our ability to add new resellers and our ability to design  develop  and release new products 
we engage third party assemblers  which in fiscal year were all quality services in fremont  california and isis surface mounting  inc in san jose  california to insert the hardware components into the printed circuit board 
we purchase fully assembled chassis from advantech corporation  analog phones from fanstel corporation  internet protocol phones from bcm communications  inc  single board computers for our max product from aaeon electronics  inc and raw material components from avnet electronics 
we selected our manufacturing partners with the goals of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
we continue to focus on developing enhancements to our current products to provide greater functionality and increased capabilities  based on our market research  customer feedback and our competitors product offerings  as well as creating new product offerings to both enhance our position in our target market segment and enter new geographical markets 
additionally  we intend to continue selling our products to small to medium sized businesses  enterprise businesses  multisite businesses  corporate and branch offices and call centers 
also  we plan to continue to recruit additional resellers and distributors to focus on selling phone systems to our target customers 
we believe that the adoption rate for this internet telephony is much faster with small to medium sized businesses because many of these businesses have not yet made a significant investment for a traditional phone system 
also  we believe that small to medium sized businesses are looking for call center type administration to increase the productivity and efficiency of their contacts with customers 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
net sales consist primarily of revenue from direct sales to end users  including resellers  and sales to distributors 
we recognize revenue pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 

revenue from sales to end users is recognized upon shipment  when risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed and determinable 
we provide for estimated sales returns and allowances and warranty costs related to such sales at the time of shipment in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

net revenue consists of product revenue reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return and protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by the distributors 
upon termination of such distribution agreements  any unsold products may be returned by the distributor for a full refund 
these agreements may be canceled without cause for convenience following a specified notice period 
as a result of the above provisions  we defer recognition of distributor revenue until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the amounts deferred as a result of this policy are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the related cost of revenue is also deferred and reported in the consolidated balance sheets as inventory 
our total deferred revenue was million and  as of september  and september   respectively 
the million increase in deferred revenue in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to our service support plans  which added million to deferred revenue and an increase of  in deferred channel revenue 
the deferred channel revenue increase was due to the volume of products shipped to distribution as opposed to what was sold 
we work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and attempt to ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to resellers and end users 
service support programs 
in september  we introduced our software assurance program which provides our customers with the latest updates  new releases  and technical support for the applications they are licensed to use 
in fiscal  we initiated our premier service plan  which includes software assurance and extended hardware warranty 
these programs have an annual subscription and can range from one to three years 
sales from our service support programs are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the terms of their subscriptions 
the total number of customers who have enrolled in these service programs at fiscal year end increased to more than  and of the total enrollments added over the course of the year  approximately  came from our existing customer base  which we see as validation of the value of our new product and service releases 
software components are generally not sold separately from our hardware components 
software revenue consists of license revenue that is recognized upon delivery of the application products or features 
we provide software assurance consisting primarily of the latest software updates  patches  new releases and technical support 
in accordance with sop  revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based upon the relative fair value of the elements 
the revenue allocated on this element is recognized with the initial licensing fee on delivery of the software 
this software assurance revenue is in addition to the initial license fee and is recognized over a period of one to three years 
the estimated cost of providing software assurance during the arrangement is insignificant and unspecified upgrades and enhancements offered at no cost during software assurance arrangements have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  minimal and infrequent 
all estimated costs of providing the services  including upgrades and enhancements  are spread over the life of the software assurance term 
cash and cash equivalent 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in various investment grade institutional money market accounts  bank term deposits  us agency securities and commercial paper 
the company s investment policy requires investments to be rated single a or better 
as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million to million as of september  we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal year with positive cash flow from operations 
short term investment 
the company s policy is to invest in highly rated securities with strong liquidity and requires investments to be rated single a or better 
short term investments are comprised of us agency securities  corporate bonds and notes and commercial paper 
short term investments are highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and are classified as available for sale investments 
we classify our available for sale securities as current assets and report them at their fair value 
further  we recognize unrealized gains and losses related to these securities as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity 
we evaluate our available for sale securities for impairment quarterly 
during fiscal year  we did not record any impairment on outstanding securities 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our inventory balance was million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
we perform a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter  with consideration given to future customer demand for our products  obsolescence from rapidly changing technology  product development plans  and other factors 
if future demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our estimates prove to be inaccurate due to unforeseen technological changes  we may be required to record additional inventory provision which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs were recorded 
in prior periods  we had established a reserve to write off excess inventory that management believed would not be sold 
in fiscal year  we disposed of fully reserved inventory with a carrying value of zero and an original cost at million 
we attribute this overall reduction in obsolete inventory to physically disposing of a portion of the reserved inventory 
the disposal of such inventory had no material impact on our revenue  gross margins and net loss 
for the year ended september   we recognized a provision of  for excess and obsolete inventories as compared to  for fiscal year ended september  inventory allowance was  and million as of september  and  respectively 
warranty cost 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if actual products return rates  repair cost or replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  then our gross margin could be adversely affected 
the reserve for product warranties was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
this change was the result of a significant decline in the product return rate caused by changes in our management of the return programs 
as a consequence of the company s standardized manufacturing processes and product testing procedures  returns of defective product are infrequent and the quantities have not been significant 
accordingly  historical warranty costs have not been material

in the americas segment  non system related revenue was million in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal year non system related revenue is primarily generated from our service support plans 
the change in net revenue excluding non system related revenue was a decrease of approximately 
this decrease in the americas segment was primarily attributable to a change in our product mix 
the number of systems shipped in fiscal year was approximately lower than the previous year and the average revenue per system was lower by approximately because our smaller systems decreased approximately while larger systems increased 
the increase in net revenue in the international segment was primarily attributable to our efforts to develop and expand our international operations 
although we intend to focus on increasing international sales  we expect that sales to enterprise customers in the united states will continue to comprise the significant majority of our sales 
cost of revenue our cost of product revenue consists primarily of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to the manufacturing of our products 
the majority of these costs vary with the unit volumes of product sold

accordingly  we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields  including voice and ip communications  unified communications network design  data networking and software engineering 
our principal research and development activities are conducted in fremont  california and shanghai  china

sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million  or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the expense increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in absolute dollars  was primarily related to an increase in personnel related and overhead expenses of approximately million due to an increase in headcount of approximately 
other factors included an increase in share based compensation expense of  an increase in promotional and lead generation programs of  an increase of  in advertising   increase in partner conference expenses 
additionally  travel expenses  consulting expenses and sales and marketing expenses in china accounted for  the expense increase in our china operations was primarily due to our efforts to develop and expand our international operations to help increase international sales 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods over the long term due to increased staffing levels  particularly in sales and increased marketing activities and as we face increasing commission expense to the extent we achieve higher sales levels 
general and administrative g a general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  facilities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and other general corporate expenses

r   increase in service and bank related expenses and  increase in general and administrative expenses in china 
approximately  in service and bank related expenses were attributable to increased bank fees due to an increase in our online sales activities such as the service support plans 
the increase in personnel related and non cash stock based compensation expense are directly tied to the hiring of our new president and chief operating officer 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we continue efforts to expand our business 
although we recognized the majority of costs associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley section in fiscal  we believe continuing compliance will be a significant expense 
we intend to continue to focus on controlling general and administrative expenses

the cash impact of the loss for the twelve months ended september  was partially offset by non cash adjustments of  in depreciation and amortization costs and non cash stock based compensation expense of  the decrease in accounts receivable during this period was the result of routine period to period fluctuations 
the change in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase of million in our service support plans as well as an increase of  in deferred channel revenue 
the deferred channel revenue increase was due to the volume of products shipped to distribution as apposed to what was sold 
we work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and attempt to ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to resellers and end users 
net cash used in operating activities of  for fiscal year  was based on a lower net loss of  an increase of  in net inventories  an increase of  in accounts receivable and  increase in prepaid and other current assets 
the cash impact of the loss for the year was partially offset by non cash adjustments of  in depreciation and amortization costs  and non cash stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal year  net cash provided by investing activities was million as compared  in fiscal this increase was related to proceeds from maturities of short term investments of approximately million and purchases of short term investments of approximately million during fiscal as compared to proceeds from maturities of short term investments of approximately  million and purchases of short term investments of approximately  million during fiscal net cash used in financing activities for the twelve months ended september  was approximately  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal this change was primarily attributable to the repurchase of treasury stock of approximately  and an increase of  in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options

net accounts receivable decreased to million at september  from million at september  our days sales outstanding dso decreased at days as of september  from days at september  this decrease in net accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in sales excluding non system related revenue and routine period to period fluctuations 
as we continue to focus on developing products that allow us to enhance our position in our target market segment and enter new markets  we expect to achieve our goal of revenue growth for fiscal year we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal year with a cash conversion cycle of days as compared to days for the fourth quarter of fiscal the cash conversion cycle is the duration between purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash from the sale of our products and services and is a metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets 
the cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of days of sales outstanding dso added to days of supply in inventories dos  reduced by days of payable outstanding dpo 
net inventories was million in both fiscal years and and our annualized inventory turn rate decreased to times as of september  as compared to times as of september  our annualized inventory turn rate represents the number of times inventory is replenished during the year 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of finished goods inventory to meet our forecasted product sales with limited levels of inventory to compensate for unanticipated shifts in sales volume and product mix 
inventory management will continue to be an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
accounts payable increased to million at september  from  at september   this increase was primarily attributable to increased purchasing activity of approximately  required to support our general business operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
the maturities of our short term investments are staggered throughout the year to ensure we meet our cash requirements 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our products  our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products  the prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase  as well as other factors 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or if sales from our new products or enhancements are lower than expected  we will be required to make additional reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations 
additional financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we also may require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we cannot raise needed funds in the future on acceptable terms  we may not be able to further develop or enhance our products  take advantage of opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may or may not be able to obtain 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of investing in our securities 
we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of september  we had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable capital and operating leases of  as of september  our lease terms range from three to nine years 
we believe  we have sufficient cash reserves to allow us to continue operations for more than a year 
our cash and short term investments totaled approximately million as of september  the following table presents certain payments due by us under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september  fiscal year ended september  contractual obligations total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due in more than years in thousands operating leases obligation capital leases obligation total contractual lease obligation recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified fsp no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  the value of those investments 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and investments  we have concluded that a change in interest rates does not pose a material market risk to us 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in non us currencies  primarily the chinese yuan renminbi 
in the short term  we do not foresee foreign exchange currency fluctuations to pose a material market risk to us 
in future periods over the long term  we anticipate we will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary
