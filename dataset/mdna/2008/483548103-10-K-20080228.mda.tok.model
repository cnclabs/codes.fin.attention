table of contents we sold our music segment on december  for million to fender and recorded a pre tax gain of million 
we also sold the assets of our fuzing segment s mm product line on december  to dse  inc and recorded a pre tax gain of million 
in december  we redeemed the last of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
we increased our quarterly dividend by percent to per share  reflecting the continuing progress we have made over the past several years and our confidence in the company s competitive position in the principal markets we serve 
the aerostructures  fuzing and specialty bearings segments continued to improve profitability through operating efficiencies and further developing relationships with many key customers including sikorsky  boeing and airbus  which resulted in the broadening of our business base 
our industrial distribution segment continued to win new national account contracts that have allowed us to increase our business base and further diversify our broad array of products 
our net sales from continuing operations for were billion  an increase of percent over  with our specialty bearings segment and the industrial distribution segment generating record sales for net earnings from continuing operations were million  or per share diluted  compared to net earnings from continuing operations for of million  or per share diluted 
the increase was due in significant part to higher sales volume  increased gross profit and continued focus on controlling operating expenses 
iii 
results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales in thousands aerostructures fuzing helicopters specialty bearings subtotal aerospace segments industrial distribution total change change vs 
the growth in consolidated net sales for compared to was primarily due to increased shipments on several key product lines in our aerostructures  fuzing and specialty bearing segments  which was driven by the currently strong commercial and military aerospace markets 
our industrial distribution segment experienced sales growth during as a result of several new national accounts and continued strength in the central and west regions 
vs 
the increase in sales was mainly due to higher organic sales  attributable to a variety of factors including an improved economic environment in the aerospace industry as well as stability in most of the markets in which the industrial distribution segment participated 

table of contents gross profit in thousands gross profit change change of net sales vs 
the increase in the consolidated gross profit for was primarily attributable to sales growth in the industrial distribution and specialty bearings segments 
in addition  the accrued contract loss charge related to additional anticipated cost growth on our helicopters segment s australia program was million for as compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin has improved slightly due to higher sales volume  increased efficiencies and a growing business base at all of our aerospace reporting segments 
vs 
the gross profit included million in charges for our helicopters segment s australia helicopter program as compared to million in both the and charges were offset by an increase in overall gross profit  primarily due to higher sales volume  at the other aerospace segments and the industrial distribution segment 
the gross profit includes a recovery of million related to certain amounts due from md helicopters  inc mdhi that were previously written off 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin improved during primarily as a result of increased efficiencies  higher sales volume and a growing business base at our aerostructures  fuzing and specialty bearings segments as well as continued focus on gross margin improvement in our industrial distribution segment 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a in thousands s  g a change change of net sales vs 
the increase in s  g a for compared to was primarily driven by our industrial distribution segment and corporate expenses 
our industrial distribution segment experienced higher operating expenses due to additional costs incurred for new branch openings and overall increased personnel costs 
corporate expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in stock compensation expense and higher group insurance expense 
total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased percentage points in compared to this was primarily due to greater sales volume as well as continued cost control efforts 
vs 
s  g a expense incurred by our reporting segments increased million  however this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in corporate expense 
our combined aerospace segments s  g a increased percent primarily due to higher operating expenses as a result of higher sales volume in our aerostructures  fuzing and specialty bearings segments  and higher personnel costs due to an increase in headcount 
during our helicopters segment recorded a recovery of million of bad debt expense related to mdhi 
industrial distribution segment s  g a expense increased percent primarily due to expenses related to higher sales volume  an increase in pension expense and higher personnel costs partially attributable to an increase in 
table of contents headcount due to new branch openings 
the decrease in corporate expense was primarily driven by a million decrease in stock appreciation rights sar expense due to a fewer sars outstanding at the end of compared to and b less volatility in the company s stock price during as compared to additionally  during the company incurred legal and financial advisory fees of million related to the recapitalization as compared to an insurance recovery related to this matter of million in the decreases in these expenses were slightly offset by higher personnel costs as well as higher stock compensation expense of million due to the adoption of sfas r 
operating income in thousands operating income change change of net sales vs 
the increase in operating income for was primarily attributable to stronger operating results in all of our reporting segments within the aerospace industry as further discussed in the following sections 
our industrial distribution segment s operating income was lower in compared to partially as a result of a variety of expenses incurred for start up costs relative to several new national account contracts 
vs 
the improvement in operating income for was primarily attributable to stronger operating results in our combined aerospace segments driven by the strong aerospace industry  as well as lower charges related to the australia program 
our industrial distribution segment s moderate sales growth  resulting from further market penetration and a stable economy  was also a primary driver in the increased operating income 
the decrease in corporate s  g a expense discussed above also contributed substantially to the improvement in operating income in the operating income includes the recovery of million of previously written off mdhi program investments 
additional consolidated results net interest expense for remained relatively flat compared to primarily due to similar borrowings during as compared to net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and the convertible debentures offset by interest income 
net interest expense increased percent to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings  as well as higher interest rates charged on borrowings during as compared to additionally  net interest expense for included receipts of million for interest payments from mdhi on past due amounts 
the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for was percent 
for  the effective income from continuing operations tax rate was percent as compared to the effective tax rate of percent for the higher tax rate in arose principally from the non deductibility of expenses associated with sars and the company s recapitalization 
the effective tax rate represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
other matters in connection with our sale of the music segment  we assumed responsibility for meeting certain requirements of the connecticut transfer act that apply to the leased guitar manufacturing facility ovation located in new hartford  connecticut  which was transferred as part of the sale 
under the act  we are required to assess the 
table of contents environmental conditions of the site and remediate environmental impairments  if any  caused by ovation s operations 
the site consists of a multi tenant industrial park  in which ovation and other unrelated entities lease space 
we are in the process of assessing the environmental conditions at the site and determining our share of the cost of whatever environmental remediation may be required 
we currently estimate our portion of the cost to assess the environmental conditions and remediate this property will be approximately million  which has been included in the determination of the net gain on the sale of music 
in preparation for disposal of the moosup  connecticut  facility  ctdep has given us conditional approval for reclassification of groundwater in the vicinity of the facility consistent with the character of the area 
we have substantially completed the process of connecting neighboring properties to public drinking water in accordance with such approval and in coordination with the ctdep and local authorities 
we anticipate that this project will be completed in combined aerospace segments results the following table presents selected financial data for our combined aerospace segments net sales aerostructures fuzing helicopters specialty bearings total aerospace segments change change operating income aerostructures fuzing helicopters specialty bearings total aerospace segments change change aerospace trends the market both the commercial and military aerospace markets were strong during and it is anticipated that this positive trend will continue through several major prime contractors  including boeing  are anticipating a large number of shipments of commercial and military aircraft over the next few years 
our strategy before  our kaman aerospace corporation subsidiary was one in which many of our activities were designed to support our prime helicopter operations 
we were not able to compete effectively in our target markets in part due to higher operating expenses as a result of a lower than sufficient business base 
in  we realigned kac and created separate divisions to provide a more focused organizational structure  separating the operating units that were subject to larger prime contractor overheads from the other operating units 
this realignment allowed for greater transparency and accountability through a more focused management structure 

table of contents this realignment along with upgrades to our facilities  lean initiatives and strategic positioning as a subcontractor to the prime aerospace contractors has allowed us to build our business base and develop our reputation as a lower cost  high quality domestic partner 
we have been able to successfully build upon several key programs  which are discussed in the following paragraphs 
kaman s strategies for our reporting segments in the aerospace industry are aerostructures take advantage of the trend toward increased outsourcing by both the aircraft prime manufacturers and tier suppliers 
fuzing become the leading producer of fuzing systems for the us military and allied militaries 
helicopters take advantage of increasing opportunities in subcontracting as the major producers move from manufacturing to final assembly and systems integration 
specialty bearings maintain leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support while staying ahead of the curve in product technology enhancement  lean manufacturing techniques and lead time reduction 
aerostructures segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract this information is not available  as we did not realign kaman aerospace corporation until the beginning of the growth in net sales in compared to was primarily due to higher production levels and increased shipments to sikorsky for the black hawk helicopter program 
during  we delivered cockpits as compared to the delivered in additional sikorsky offload work  boeing shipments and other boeing commercial work also contributed to the increase in sales in operating income increased primarily as a result of greater sales volume for the sikorsky black hawk programs 
these positive operating results were offset partially by certain adverse adjustments resulting from a rapid increase in manpower  production inefficiencies and excess inventory experienced at the wichita facility during the ramp up of several new programs 
we continue to work on these programs as more fully discussed below 
the largest driver of the increase in sales for compared to was the contract with sikorsky for the production of cockpits for the black hawk helicopter 
other key drivers included higher shipments to boeing  most notably for the program  based on an increase in boeing s commercial aircraft production 
our jacksonville facility continued to expand its business base principally as a result of the sikorsky cockpit program which resulted in the majority of the increase in operating profit for this segment in compared to 
table of contents aerostructures major programs at the wichita facility we have continued to work on ramping up contracts awarded during by spirit aerosystems and shenyang aircraft corporation associated with the boeing dreamliner program  as well as a new program to manufacture and assemble composite tail rotor pylons for sikorsky s canadian mh helicopters 
this ramp up process has proceeded at a significantly slower pace than originally anticipated due to a variety of factors  including our development of personnel and processes needed for each program and  particularly with respect to the mh program  the product s design evolution  delayed receipt of certain customer provided components  and development of quality control inspection processes 
as a result  the wichita operation has experienced increased manpower and production costs  production inefficiencies  and higher inventory obsolescence reserves 
during  we will continue to work through these issues and address and mutually resolve the expressed concerns of our customers  with the expectation of normalizing production flow for these programs 
in the fourth quarter of  we signed a memorandum of agreement with sikorsky for a multi year contract to manufacture several models of the black hawk helicopter cockpits through at the jacksonville facility 
this program includes the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for cockpits on several models of the black hawk helicopter 
this program has a total potential value of approximately million 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we also signed a year follow on contract with boeing for the production of wing fixed trailing edge assemblies on the boeing and aircraft 
both of these programs are important to this segment s continued growth 
during we continued to make significant progress on our current orders for the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit 
to date  sikorsky has placed orders for cockpits  for various models of the helicopter 
we anticipate that deliveries on these orders will continue through a total of cockpits have been delivered under this contract from inception through the end of during work also continued on the production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c the program was originally scheduled to conclude in mid with the completion of the th aircraft 
as previously reported  boeing informed the company that the program will continue for a minimum of additional shipsets  extending deliveries through the end of we continue to work with the customer that could lead to additional work extending beyond this long term program has been an important element in helping to maintain a sufficient business base at the jacksonville facility 
aerostructures segment warranty matters in december  we reversed a warranty accrual established in in anticipation of costs to be incurred in connection with the replacement of certain non conforming aircraft panels manufactured by our wichita facility 
the original accrual was for million  of which million was spent during and early we have continued to do work for both the customers affected by this warranty matter and are currently negotiating a long term agreement to produce this same part in the future for one of those customers 
based on the information currently available  we believe it is unlikely that we will incur any additional costs for this warranty matter 
therefore  during december  we reversed the remaining million balance of the reserve 

table of contents fuzing segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract this information is not available  as we did not realign kaman aerospace corporation until the beginning of the increase in sales for as compared to was primarily due to the higher volume of jpf program shipments to both us and foreign militaries as well as greater shipments of mm products 
the increase in operating income for was primarily due to the increased shipments to foreign allied militaries for the jpf program  greater sales on the jpf facilitization program as well as higher sales volume on several mm contracts 
the increase in sales and operating income for was primarily due to higher production volume and shipments at the middletown  connecticut facility for its legacy fuzing programs  higher shipments on the jpf program at the dayron facility  and sales generated by the jpf facilitization program 
these positive operating results were partially offset by a decrease in sales on the mm programs due to production interruptions in early that continued through mid fuzing major programs our fuzing segment continued to produce fuzes under its contract with the us air force for the advanced fmu a b jpf 
the current total value of jpf contracts awarded by the us government usg from inception through december  is million 
this value primarily consists of options through under the original contract and various contract modifications  including a two phase facilitization contract modification and additional foreign military sales facilitated by the us government  as well as a variety of development and engineering contracts  along with special tooling and test equipment 
deliveries under option were completed during the second quarter of production under option commenced during the second quarter of and we expect that deliveries under this option will be completed by mid we project that work currently under contract relative to this program will extend until mid in february  the usg released production for option of the program  which has a value of million 
profits to date on the usg portion of the program have been essentially at break even 
as the jpf product has continued to develop in the market  we are focused on further marketing the jpf to foreign allied militaries 
we have begun to make shipments to foreign allied militaries under both the usg contract as well as separate direct sales 
foreign sales are important to the ultimate success of the program  as this will allow for further market penetration and increased sales 
overall  we believe that profitability will improve as progress is made relative to operating efficiencies  as we negotiate further price increases with the usg  as deliveries to the us military increase and as further orders are received from foreign militaries 
during  we continued to make progress on production improvements and enhancements of the jpf fuze system  yet the line remains subject to periodic production interruptions 
the line has been subject to several shut downs during the year  which has resulted in irregular shipments and increased costs due to the inefficiencies 
table of contents associated with the interruptions 
although we currently believe that resolution of production issues is progressing  continued work and improvement is necessary 
we were able to significantly increase production on this program during the year and expect that as these issues are resolved the program will continue to ramp up to full capacity 
the facilitization program that is currently underway is another important element of our strategy to improve our quality and efficiency and increase production on the jpf program 
this facilitization program provides us an opportunity to review production workflow to create greater efficiencies  qualify a second kaman site middletown for full production of jpf fuzes  and create a new fuze design 
completion of testing of this new design is expected in the first quarter of the new design is expected to significantly reduce the number of technical issues so that a more steady state of production can be achieved 
we expect that the program will be completed in mid and believe that the value of these initiatives will be more fully realized in and beyond 
on december   we sold the assets related to the mm product line for a pre tax gain of million 
this divestiture was considered necessary to allow us to focus our attention and resources on our core programs  which include the jpf program 
we believe the work under the current contracts awarded as well as future work that could be developed based on the jpf platform is an essential element of the segment s future success 
warranty and contract related matters there continue to be two warranty related matters that primarily impact the fmu program at our fuzing segment s orlando operation 
the items involved are an impact switch embedded in certain bomb fuzes that was recalled by a supplier and an incorrect part  called a bellows motor  found to be contained in bomb fuzes manufactured for the us army utilizing systems which originated before the orlando operation was acquired by kaman 
the us army sustainment command usasc  the procurement agency that administers the fmu contract  had authorized warranty rework for the bellows motor matter in late early  however  we were not permitted to finish the rework due to issues raised by the usasc primarily related to administrative matters and requests for verification of the accuracy of test equipment which accuracy was subsequently verified 
in late  the usasc informed us that it was changing its remedy under the contract from performance of warranty rework to an equitable adjustment of million to the contract price 
we responded  explaining our view that we have complied with contract requirements 
in june the usasc affirmed its position but rescinded its million demand stating that its full costs had not yet been determined and gave instructions for disposition of the subject fuzes  including both the impact switch and bellows motor related items  to a navy facility 
in september  the usasc informed us that it was considering termination of the contract for default  alleging that there was a latent defect in some fuzes produced due to allegedly unauthorized rework during production 
the usasc also purported to revoke acceptance of fuzes in over twenty lots delivered over several years for this reason and was reportedly continuing to review other lots of previously accepted fuzes  to date  the usasc has not made a demand for any specific amount of reimbursement from the company 
management responded to the usasc s allegations and continues to believe that the segment has performed in accordance with the contract  a termination for default is inappropriate  and it is the government rather than the company that has materially breached the contract 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the segment initiated cancellation of its contract with the usasc due to the usasc s material breaches of the agreement and requested a final decision from the usasc regarding its purported revocation of acceptance 
the usasc did not respond to this request 
therefore  in january  the company commenced litigation before the armed services board of contract appeals the board requesting a declaratory judgment that we used permissible rework procedures  the usasc s revocation of acceptance of fuzes is improper  and the usasc s breaches of the 
table of contents contract are material  justifying our cancellation of the contract 
at about the same time  the usasc notified us that it is terminating the contract for default  pursuant to its september letter described above 
the company thereafter filed a second complaint with the board appealing the usasc s termination decision 
these matters are now in the litigation process 
in february  management received notification from the us attorney s office for the middle district of florida that it has closed the investigation initiated two years ago in conjunction with the defense criminal investigative service and will not prosecute the company or any of its employees for conduct that was the subject of the investigation the bellows motor warranty matter 
helicopters segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract this information is not available  as we did not realign kaman aerospace corporation until the beginning of the higher sales for our helicopters segment during were a result of a greater volume of work on the depot level maintenance and upgrade program for the egyptian sh g e aircraft and the sikorsky black hawk helicopter program 
the sikorsky program involves fuselage joining and installation tasks along with various mechanical subassemblies 
the increase in operating income for was primarily driven by lower charges on the australian program during as compared to as well as increased sales volume 
total charges on the australian program in were million as compared to million for the decrease in net sales for compared to was primarily attributable to lower k max aircraft sales 
in  we sold only one k max aircraft  the last available as compared to four aircraft having been sold in the sale of the last k max also signaled the end of our aircraft lease revenue stream 
this decrease was partially offset by new work that we performed for sikorsky during total charges on the australian program for were million compared to million in the charges were offset partially by the recovery of million of previously written off mdhi program investments 
helicopters sh programs work continued on the sh g a program for australia during this program involves the remanufacture of eleven helicopters with support  including a support services facility  for the royal australian navy 
following a review of the program and possible alternatives initiated by the commonwealth s minister of defence in mid  the minister announced in may that the commonwealth would proceed with the program  subject to satisfactory contract arrangements 
since that time  in addition to ongoing program activities  the parties have been engaged in discussions aimed at developing a mutually acceptable path forward to complete the program 
among the matters being discussed are a the approach that will be taken regarding completion of formal qualification testing of the integrated tactical avionics system itas software and payment responsibility for additional work that the commonwealth may want to pursue  
table of contents b the approach to conducting additional work scope that would assist the commonwealth in preparing for current australia aircraft certification requirements and for which the commonwealth would have payment responsibility 
the company has previously reported on the potential for an additional effort that would involve development and testing of new software and hardware requirements for the aircraft s automatic flight control system at an estimated contract value of million 
the parties are continuing discussions to initiate a portion of such work that would consist of analysis and definition of the nature of the software and hardware revisions described above  however the value and specific scope of this initial effort have not yet been agreed upon  and c development of a mutually agreed payment and performance schedule addressing these and other remaining program tasks 
in november  the commonwealth held elections and the labor party the opposition party was successful  one result has been the appointment of new ministers of defence and procurement 
management has been advised by the commonwealth that these officials are reviewing the sh g a program among several other defense programs and a determination will be made about its continuation 
management believes that the company has performed its obligations under the program and that the sh g a helicopter is the most efficient and cost effective method to achieve the commonwealth s operational needs 
the contract dispute resolution process initiated by the commonwealth in january  which the parties subsequently agreed to suspend with a mutual waiver of applicable statutes of limitation periods  continues to be outstanding 
the commonwealth s principal assertions are that the helicopters have not been delivered in a timely manner and the design of the helicopter  particularly the automatic flight control system  is inadequate from a safety perspective 
management believes that our obligations to the commonwealth under the program are being performed and the design of the sh g a is safe and proper as demonstrated by the significant operational history of this aircraft type with several countries  including the united states  egypt  new zealand  and poland 
the combined contracts have a current anticipated value of million 
the helicopter production portion of the program is valued at million  essentially all of which has been recorded as sales 
the associated in service support center contract has a current anticipated value of million  of which percent has been recorded as sales through the end of continued cost growth on the production contract has required additional charges to the contract loss reserve including a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of this production contract has been in a loss position since the remaining accrued contract loss as of the end of was million 
this contract loss accrual continues to be monitored and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current anticipated cost of completing the contract 
at the conclusion of this contract  we anticipate filing a claim for a refund with the irs for look back interest  which we believe may be in excess of million pre tax 
look back interest income relates to the timing of taxes paid on contract profit recognized in prior periods 
our policy is to record this interest income or expense when the contract is completed as defined under irs regulations 
we continued our work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine sh g e helicopters delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
the total work scope is planned to include depot level maintenance and upgrades for all nine aircraft 
through december   we are on contract for approximately million of work related to maintenance and upgrades 
to date  work for depot level maintenance on four of the aircraft has been completed 
helicopters other major programs and contract related matters during  we continued to work under a contract from the army material research development and engineering command for follow on work associated with development of the burro unmanned resupply helicopter  utilizing the k max helicopter 
the contract currently covers work to enhance features of the flight 
table of contents and mission management system and to support burro participation in army demonstrations 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement with lockheed martin systems integration which will provide an opportunity for the parties to work together to develop potential government programs foreign and domestic  involving the k max helicopter and the burro aircraft 
in january  the segment and lockheed jointly acquired three k max helicopters from a us government general services administration auction for an average cost of million 
the aircraft are expected to be used to further develop the burro program 
we continue to support k max helicopters that are operating with customers 
at the end of  we maintained million of k max inventory  which consisted principally of spare parts 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to install the redesigned clutch into k max aircraft 
the installation of the new clutch into all k max aircraft will occur gradually over the next several years  as the aircraft are brought in by our customers for their routine maintenance 
in december  the company and the us navy air systems command navair agreed upon the terms for our purchase of the portion of the bloomfield campus that kaman aerospace corporation of which the helicopters segment forms a part currently leases from navair and has operated for several decades 
it is now expected that  in the next several months  various government required processes for approval of the transaction will be undertaken 
once formal government approval has been obtained and the title transfer documentation has been prepared by the general services administration  transfer of title to the property can take place 
our lease of the facility has been extended through september  as the process continues 
upon transfer of the property and as part of the purchase price  we will assume responsibility for environmental remediation at the facility as may be required under the connecticut transfer act 
in anticipation of the transfer  we continued our efforts to define the scope of the remediation that will be required by the ctdep 
management believes that the present value of the cost of the environmental remediation  which is estimated at million  approximates the fair value of the property 
this remediation process would take many years to complete 
specialty bearings segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract our specialty bearings segment achieved record sales and record backlog for the increase in net sales during was primarily attributable to higher shipments for our bearings product lines  specifically to customers principally in the regional jet market and military aircraft market 
we also experienced strong growth in sales to customers that participate in the commercial aftermarket and engine market 
the largest market that we sell to  commercial jetliners  had moderate growth as our two major customers were in the process of bringing new aircraft to market 
to a lesser extent  the increase in sales was also attributable to the currency translation effect on the euro  which positively affected the us dollar value of sales reported by our germany facility 
operating income increased primarily due to the increased sales volume  continued lean improvements on the production line and higher absorption of s  g a expenses during as compared to 
table of contents the increase in net sales for compared to was a result of a higher volume of shipments to our customers in the commercial aircraft original equipment market and aftermarket  regional jet market and the commercial engine market 
the increase in operating income for compared to was primarily due to the increased sales volume 
specialty bearings major programs over the past several years  specialty bearings has benefited significantly from our strategy to provide a high quality product with shorter lead times than our competitors  to customers in both the commercial and military markets 
increased orders in the regional jet market  combined with large orders from significant customers  including boeing  continued throughout and are expected to remain strong during as evidenced by results  we have sustained our focus on process improvement and increasing operating efficiencies and these efforts have allowed us to maintain customer service levels even with the higher level of order activity 
we continue to target the most demanding applications early in the aircraft design process as part of prime contractors problem solving teams 
we then apply innovative technology to develop and manufacture proprietary products to address our customers needs while providing exemplary performance and service 
we believe technological enhancements we make to our current products  as well as the development of new products  will preserve our competitive advantages and increase our customer base  and lead to further penetration of both domestic and foreign markets 
industrial distribution segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales our industrial distribution segment generated record sales for the fourth consecutive year despite an increasingly difficult industrial market 
the increase in sales is primarily due to the ramp up of national account business  as well as continued strength in the energy and power generation  mining and oil exploration and food processing industries 
during  despite the increase in sales volume and the associated increase in gross margin  we experienced a decrease in operating income compared to the decrease was partially attributable to additional start up costs for new branch openings and other implementation costs we have incurred to support several new national account contracts that were awarded in and late additionally  during we experienced an increase in overall operating expenses and higher personnel costs primarily driven by increased headcount necessary to support our growing business base 
the increase in sales during compared to was primarily due to steady growth in all the regions and most of the markets in which we participate 
specifically  the strongest performance resulted from the mining  chemical and energy sectors in the west region 
the central and east region generated steady growth throughout the year specifically in the food processing industry and the original equipment manufacturing oem sectors 
the increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in sales volume 
further margin improvements as a result of a variety of margin control programs and higher rebate income for also contributed to the increase year over year 
these improvements were offset to some extent by higher personnel costs related to salary increases as well as additions to headcount due to branch openings  and increased pension expense 

table of contents industrial distribution trends the market because of our diverse customer base  our performance tends to track the us industrial production index 
we are therefore affected  to a large extent  by the overall business climate for our customer industries  which includes plant capacity utilization levels  and the effect of pricing spikes and or supply interruptions for basic commodities such as steel and oil 
the strength of certain markets varied considerably by industry type in  and industries such as food processing  mining  oil exploration and electrical power generation continued to perform well 
other industries have experienced a decline  including the building materials industry with respect to new home construction  oems and the automotive industry 
our business will continue to be impacted by the slowing of the economy that occurred during the later part of and into our strategy the strategy for the industrial distribution segment is to expand our geographic footprint in major industrial markets to enhance our position in the competition for regional and national accounts 
in order to increase our geographic footprint  we continue to explore potential acquisition candidates as well as establish branches in locations that are consistent with our strategic objectives 
by so doing  we will more clearly establish our business as one that can provide comprehensive services to our customers who are continually focused on streamlining their purchasing operations and consolidating supplier relationships 
during  we were able to successfully renew our contract for a four year period with procter gamble  one of our largest national accounts 
additionally  we worked to bring our new national account contracts online 
this process was essentially completed during late we expect the benefits from these contracts to be more fully realized during and beyond 
broaden our product offering to gain additional business from existing customers and new opportunities from a wider slice of the market 
in recent years  we have worked to increase market share in several growing markets including the mining  energy and food and beverage industries 
we believe that we have been successful in this endeavor  as evidenced by our recent national account wins  and continue to focus on these industries 
in order to meet the needs of current and new customers  we are focused on maintaining competitive pricing as well as providing value added services that save our customers money and time while helping them improve operating efficiency 
further enhance operating and asset utilization efficiencies throughout the enterprise

liquidity and capital resources discussion and analysis of cash flows we assess the company s liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund working capital  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from or used by operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in our business segments and their programs  acquisitions  divestitures  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and factors that might otherwise affect the company s business and operations generally  as described under the heading forward looking statements in item a of part i of this form k 
for most of  we continued to rely significantly upon borrowings in order to fund our working capital requirements as well as certain investing and financing activities 
our working capital needs continued as we ramped up new programs  made strategic inventory purchases for the industrial distribution segment  and continued to experience delays in the completion of the australian sh g a program 
on december   we received cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the music segment  a portion of which we used to pay down a substantial amount of our revolving line of credit 
ultimately we expect to use the remaining cash primarily to fund our strategic objectives  including acquisitions 
going forward  we will rely upon the balance of the sale proceeds as well as bank financing as important sources of support for our business activities 
we believe these  when combined with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to support our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
the resolution of any of the matters described in management s discussion and analysis  including the fmu warranty matter  the australian sh g a program  the purchase of the navair property and associated environmental remediation  and the sikorsky tail rotor pylon matter  could have an impact on our future liquidity 
however  we do not believe any of these matters will lead to a shortage of capital resources or liquidity that would prevent us from continuing with our business operations as expected 
a summary of our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations is as follows in thousands vs 
vs 
total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities vs 
the primary drivers of our working capital are accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
we generated a significant amount of cash from accounts receivable in compared to  primarily due to considerable cash collections in our aerostructures and helicopters segments for several key programs 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable at our fuzing and industrial distribution segments  primarily due to increased sales volume in the latter portion of the year 
inventory has increased significantly over the past year  most notably in our aerostructures segment as it ramps up for new programs and continues to perform work on the sikorsky cockpit program 
accounts payable remained relatively flat 
total investing activity for included cash proceeds from the divestiture of our music segment of million as well as cash proceeds from the sale of the mm assets of million 
cash outflows for financing activities related primarily to capital expenditures within all the reporting segments 
each segment s capital expenditures were considered essential to continue to ramp up for new programs  have the tools necessary to effectively compete in the marketplace and have the capacity necessary to meet our customers expectations 
additionally  the industrial distribution segment purchased the final percent interest in delamac de mexico sa de cv in the first quarter of for million 

table of contents we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the music transaction to pay down all of our revolving credit arrangement  except for our euro note  at the end of the year 
other financing cash outflows related primarily to payment of the quarterly dividend 
vs 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the increase in cash used for working capital requirements 
our helicopters and fuzing segments were primarily responsible for the incremental working capital requirements for additionally  there was an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as well as a higher level of uncollected progress billings for certain aerospace contracts 
additional uses of cash reflected in cash provided by operating activities related to the payment of costs associated with the australian sh g a program and other loss contracts  including the boeing harbour pointe contract  on which the company worked during in  the company paid approximately million for the acquisition of musicorp whereas there were no acquisitions during this decrease was offset to some extent by a greater amount of capital expenditures during  principally as a result of the expansion of our specialty bearings facility in bloomfield  connecticut  as well as additional machinery and equipment capital expenditures by the other aerospace segments 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid million to certain former class b common shareholders in connection with the recapitalization 
our net borrowings at december  were million  which consisted of long term debt and notes payable  as compared to million at december  the borrowings were primarily to fund working capital requirements whereas the borrowings were primarily to fund the acquisition of musicorp and the recapitalization 
financing arrangements as of december   we had a million revolving credit facility revolving credit agreement expiring august  the facility includes the availability of funding in foreign currencies as well as an accordion feature that provides the company the opportunity to request  subject to bank approval  an expansion of up to million in the overall size of the facility 
our letters of credit are generally considered borrowings for purposes of the revolving credit agreement 
a total of million in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at december   million of which is related to the australian sh g a program 
the letter of credit for the production portion of the australian program currently has a balance of million 
total average bank borrowings for were million compared to million for and million for as of december   there was million available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement 
facility fees and interest rates under the revolving credit agreement are determined on the basis of the company s credit rating from standard poor s 
in february  standard poor s re affirmed the company rating as investment grade bbb with an outlook of stable 
we believe this is a favorable rating for a company of our size 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  if this rating should decrease  the effect would be to increase facility fees as well as the interest rates charged 
the financial covenants related to the revolving credit agreement include a requirement that the company have i ebitda  at least equal to percent of net interest expense  on the basis of a rolling four quarters and ii a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization of not more than percent 
the agreement also incorporates a financial covenant which provides that if the company s ebitda to net interest expense ratio is less than to  the ratio of i accounts receivable and inventory for certain kaman subsidiaries to ii the company s consolidated total indebtedness cannot be less than to we remained in compliance with those financial covenants as of and for the year ended december  
table of contents other sources uses of capital we plan to record pension expense and make a cash contribution of approximately million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan for the plan year 
this is based upon the asset value of the pension trust fund as of december  additionally during  we plan to pay approximately million in serp payments 
for the plan year  we expensed approximately million and made a contribution of million  of which million was paid in january  to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan 
this was based upon the asset value of the pension trust fund as of december  in  we made serp payments of million 
on november  we issued a redemption notice calling for full redemption on december  of all million of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due at a redemption price of of principal amount plus accrued interest to december  the debentures were convertible until the close of business on december  into shares of our common stock at the conversion price of 
from the date of the announcement to december   holders converted a total of  debentures  with a value of million  into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
there were additional conversions during prior to the redemption announcement of  debentures for a total of  shares of common stock 
on december   we paid million for the redemption of the remaining debentures 
additionally  as a result of this redemption  we immediately expensed the million remaining balance of the deferred charges associated with the debentures 
in november  our board of directors approved a replenishment of the company s stock repurchase program  providing for repurchase of an aggregate of million common shares for use in the administration of our stock plans and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   a total of  shares had been repurchased since inception of this replenishment program 
there were no shares repurchased during v 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and related disclosures based upon historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant 
we are also responsible for evaluating the propriety of our estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the most significant areas currently involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
long term contracts methodology for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based upon either the cost to cost method  in which profit is recorded based upon a ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our long term contracts 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 

table of contents judgment and uncertainties the percentage of completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract 
revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price  with consideration being given to exercised contract options  change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers  engineers  and financial professionals 
estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
the complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company s ability to estimate future contract costs 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology relative to long term contracts during the past several years 
while we currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate our long term revenues and costs  certain programs tend to be more complex relative to estimating the percentage of work complete 
as a result  changes to these programs could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
these include the australian sh g a helicopter program with the royal australian navy ran  the jpf program  the sikorsky black hawk program  the sikorsky tail rotor pylon program and several other new programs including the new boeing programs 
estimating the ultimate total cost of these programs has been challenging partially due to the complexity of the programs  the ramping up of the new programs  the lack of materials needed to complete these programs  change orders related to the programs and the need to manage our customers expectations 
these programs are an important element in the continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base 
management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company has three types of accounts receivables a trade receivables  which consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers  b us government contract receivables  which consist of amounts billed and costs and accrued profit earned but not yet billable under the terms of the contract  and c commercial and other government contract receivables  which also includes amounts billed and costs and accrued profit earned but not yet billable under the terms of the contract 
contract receivables typically relate to balances due under long term contractual arrangements under which there are progress or milestone billings in accordance with the terms of a contract 
trade receivables typically relate to products sold by the industrial distribution segment for which the sales occur generally upon shipment of the product 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable balance 
these estimates are based on known past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors impacting the credit risk associated with specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends for trade receivables  we perform ongoing reviews of account balances and the aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within a pre determined time frame based upon the credit terms extended 
for our government and commercial contracts  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of recoverable costs 
the recoverability of costs is evaluated on a contract by contract basis based upon historical trends of payments  program viability and the customer s credit worthiness 
judgment and uncertainties as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was percent of gross receivables for both years 
receivables written off  net of recoveries  in and were both million 
write offs are 
table of contents charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks associated with specific customers 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions currently we do not believe that we have a significant amount of risk relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a increase in the allowance would have a million effect on pre tax earnings 
there is additional exposure relative to amounts that we have earned but not billed relative to the sh g a program 
as of december   we had million of costs not billed that will be due and payable as the helicopters segment satisfactorily completes the australian sh g a program 
when these costs are ultimately billed to the ran  they will be offset by the application of million of contract advances previously paid to the company by the ran 
if the australian program is not resolved satisfactorily for both parties  we may not be able to collect the remaining amount unbilled 
we are working with the ran on the program and currently believe that these amounts are collectible 
inventory valuation methodology we have four types of inventory a merchandise for resale  b contracts in process  c other work in process  and d finished goods 
merchandise for resale is stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value 
contracts in process  other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material  labor and overhead  including general and administrative expenses on certain government contracts 
contracts in process  other work in process  and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we include raw material amounts in the contracts in process and other work in process balances 
raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date 
the total amount of raw material included in these in process amounts is less than percent of the total inventory balance for both and judgment and uncertainties the process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value issues often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
we adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value 
changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write downs of inventory value 
overall  management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued and not subject to further obsolescence in the near term 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation at our industrial distribution segment generally requires less subjective management judgment than the valuation of certain inventory in the four reporting segments that comprise the aerospace businesses 
based upon a market evaluation performed in we wrote down our k max inventory by million in that year 
the k max inventory balance  consisting of work in process and finished goods  was million as of december  we believe that it is stated at net realizable value  although lack of demand for spare parts in the future could result in additional write downs of the inventory value 
management reviews the k max inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write downs are necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down in this inventory at december   would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in vendor incentives methodology our industrial distribution segment enters into agreements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates that are generally earned upon achieving specified volume purchasing 
the rebate percentages may 
table of contents increase or decrease based upon the amount of inventory purchased or sold annually 
each program is analyzed and reviewed each quarter to determine the appropriateness of the projected annual rebate 
historically  differences between our estimates and actual rebates subsequently received have not been material 
we recognize rebate income relative to specific rebate programs as a reduction of the cost of inventory based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress toward earning the rebate  provided that the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
judgment and uncertainties our participation in these types of programs is an important element of our industrial distribution segment business 
these types of programs are common in distribution businesses 
although we believe that we will continue to receive vendor incentives  there is no assurance that our vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of rebates in the future 
also  we cannot estimate whether we will continue to utilize the vendor programs at the same level as in prior periods 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if we were to reduce our participation in vendor incentive programs  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets methodology goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
all intangible assets are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in conditions indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the annual evaluation is performed during the fourth quarter  based on the initial annual forecast information 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing discounted cash flow models 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon factors such as projected sales and growth rates  discount rates to reflect the risk inherent in future cash flows  and other elements requiring significant judgments 
we utilize currently available information regarding present industry and economic conditions and future expectations to prepare our estimates and perform impairment evaluations 
the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
based upon its annual evaluation  management has determined that there has been no impairment 
judgment and uncertainties we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow 
these types of analyses involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
as a result  actual results could differ significantly from the most recent forecasts  which might result in the future impairment of recorded goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
based upon our analysis  a percentage point increase in the discount rate used would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment 
additionally  a percent decrease in the fair value of our reporting units also would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment 

table of contents long term incentive programs methodology the company maintains the stock incentive plan plan  which provides for share based payment awards  including principally incentive and non statutory stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  and long term incentive program ltip awards 
in addition  the plan contains provisions intended to qualify the plan under section m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option pricing models 
non qualified stock option awards were valued using a black scholes model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted share awards at the date of grant using the closing market price of our stock 
ltip awards provide certain senior executives an opportunity to receive award payments  in either stock or cash as determined by the personnel and compensation committee of the company s board of directors in accordance with the plan  at the end of a three year performance cycle 
for each performance cycle  the company s financial results are compared to the russell indices for the same periods based upon the following a average return on total capital  b earnings per share growth and c total return to shareholders 
no awards will be payable unless the company s performance is at least in the th percentile of the designated indices 
the maximum award is payable if performance reaches the th percentile of the designated indices 
awards for performance between the th and th percentiles are determined by straight line interpolation 
awards will be paid out at at the th percentile 
in order to estimate the liability associated with ltip awards  management must make assumptions as to how our current performance compares to current russell data based upon the russell s historical results 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
when sufficient russell data for the current year is available  which typically will not be until april or may of the following year  management will adjust the liability to reflect the current best estimate of the total award 
actual results could significantly differ from management s estimates 
the total liability as of december  is million 
judgment and uncertainties option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
our long term incentive plan requires management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving long term company goals as well as estimate the impact the external russell results may have on our accrual 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million in due to the timing of availability of the russell data  there is a risk that the amount we have recorded as ltip expense could be different from the actual payout 
a percentage point increase in the total performance factor earned for our ltip would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings by million 

table of contents pension plans methodology we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan for our full time us employees with the exception of certain acquired companies that have not adopted the plan as well as a non qualified supplemental employees retirement plan serp for certain key executives 
expenses and liabilities associated with each of these plans are determined based upon actuarial valuations 
integral to these actuarial valuations are a variety of assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels 
we regularly review these assumptions  which are updated at the measurement date  december st  and disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of differences between actual results and the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods  which will affect expense recognized in future periods 
we believe that two assumptions  the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
judgment and uncertainties the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension obligation 
for  management reviewed the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index to determine the appropriateness of our discount rate assumptions 
this index was designed to provide a market average discount rate to assist plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities associated with postretirement obligations 
the citigroup index is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates 
each bond issue underlying the citigroup index is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody s investors services  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s 
additionally  we reviewed the change in the general level of interest rates since the last measurement date noting that overall rates had increased since based upon this information  we used a percent discount rate as of december  for the qualified benefit pension plan 
this rate takes into consideration the population of our pension plan and the anticipated payment stream as compared to the citigroup index and rounds the results to the nearest fifth basis point 
for the serp  we used the same methodology as the pension plan and derived a discount rate of percent for the benefit obligation 
the difference in the discount rates is primarily due to the expected duration of serp payments  which is much less as compared to the overall population of the pension plan 
the qualified defined benefit pension plan and serp used discount rates of percent and percent  respectively in for purposes of calculating the benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed based upon several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  our historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium and an inflation estimate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension expense in by million 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
the expected return on plan assets was percent for both december  and a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed return on pension plan assets assumption would have changed pension expense in by approximately million 

table of contents income taxes methodology tax laws in certain of our operating jurisdictions require items to be reported for tax purposes at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are never deductible on our tax returns  an example being the recapitalization costs incurred during  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment is not yet due or the realized tax benefit of expenses we have already reported in our tax returns  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
as of december  we had recognized million of net deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those foreign countries or us states where the expiration of tax loss or credit carry forwards or the projected operating results indicates that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
judgment and uncertainties management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was percent for our effective tax rate is based on expected or reported income or loss  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are valid and defensible  we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or changes in tax legislation 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions on january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin was a decrease of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding increase to retained earnings 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits upon adoption was million  including interest and penalties of million 
included in unrecognized tax benefits upon adoption were items approximating million that  if recognized  would favorably affect our effective tax rate in future periods 
currently we do not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months 
we file tax returns in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions  with returns subject to examination for varying periods  but generally back to and including it is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes 
a discussion of the effect of the adoption of fin is included in note self insured retentions liabilities methodology we have varying levels of deductibles for losses related to health  workers compensation  auto and general liability claims 
to limit our exposure to these claims we obtain third party insurance coverage 
our total liability deductible for workers compensation is limited to million per claim and for general liability and auto liability  we are limited to million per claim 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each 
table of contents reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period ibnr 
the estimates for the cost of the claims are based upon information provided to us by the claims administrators and are periodically revised to reflect changes in loss trends 
our ibnr estimate is based upon historical trends 
judgment and uncertainties liabilities associated with these claims are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions 
such self insurance accruals will likely include claims for which the ultimate losses will be settled over a period of years 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserve would affect our pre tax earnings by million

b this category includes purchase commitments with suppliers for materials and supplies as part of the ordinary course of business  consulting arrangements and support services 
only obligations in the amount of at least fifty thousand dollars are included 
c this category includes obligations under the company s long term incentive plan  deferred compensation plan  a supplemental disability income arrangement for one former company officer and unrecognized tax benefits under fin d this category includes planned funding of the company s serp and qualified defined benefit pension plan 
projected funding for the qualified defined benefit pension plan beyond one year has not been included as there are several significant factors  such as the future market value of plan assets and projected investment return rates  which could cause actual funding requirements to differ materially from projected funding

these letters of credit were issued to secure payments received in advance on the contract from the customer  the royal australian navy 
the letters of credit that relate to the production portion of the contract  approximately million  will remain in place until final acceptance of the first fully capable aircraft occurs 
the remaining million relates to letters of credit associated with the company s estimate of workers compensation claims incurred
