item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our tools  technologies and expertise are enablers in the semiconductor industry s transition to larger mm wafers  sub nm design rules and the use of new materials  such as copper  low capacitance low k dielectrics and barrier metals 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
in  revenues decreased by to million from million in gross profit increased year over year by million  primarily as a result of the net recognition of million in previously deferred systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy and an increase of million in royalty revenue received from dns 
we also increased our research  development and engineering rd e activity in to expand our product portfolio to accommodate sub nanometer design rules  driving an increase in rd e expenses of million  or 
income before taxes was million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in part of our strategy is to outsource selected non critical functions in manufacturing  spare parts logistics  subsystem design and other areas to third parties specializing in these areas 
this allows us to concentrate our resources on our core technologies in strip and rtp and leverage our expertise into new markets  reduce our fixed costs and achieve greater flexibility to expand and contract capacity as market conditions require 
although we have implemented cost cutting and operational flexibility measures  we are largely dependent upon increases in sales and decreases in cost of sales in order to improve our profitability 
we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no long term debt at december  with our continued strong operating results and our current cash position  we believe we are in a healthy position in terms of liquidity and capital resources 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s shares of common stock through open market purchases or private transactions 
in  million shares were repurchased under this program for million 
we have adopted this program because we believe that our available cash has exceeded the amount required to run our operations  and we also believe that the repurchases should be accretive to earnings as we execute to our business plan 
in the second half of  we experienced weakness in the overall semiconductor market  and we expect that weakness to continue into our customers are decreasing their requested delivery times  which has reduced our backlog as of december  and made our projections of future earnings more difficult 
further  due to the overall market weakness  we may experience cancellations or delays of orders that were previously included in backlog 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment  and our ability to a significantly grow the company  either organically or through acquisitions  in order to enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles and e generate the gross profits necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit  operating expenses research  development and engineering  selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles gain on disposition of wet business impairment of intangibles total operating expenses  income from operations    interest income    interest expense other income  net  income before income taxes   provision for income taxes  net income  sales 
the decrease in net sales in compared with was primarily due to an million decrease in system sales  or  and a million decrease in service and spare parts sales  or 
our net sales for also included million of royalty revenue from dainippon screen co 
dns  compared with million for the sales decline in reflected the overall decline in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in  we received business from leading semiconductor manufacturers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for of net sales in  compared to for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to net recognition of million in previously deferred systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
our gross profit for included million of royalty revenue received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of sales 
gross profit margin increased by percentage points in compared to  percentage points of which was due to net recognition of previously deferred systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  percentage point of which was due to higher gross profit margin related to systems sales  percentage points of which was due to dns royalties and percentage point of which was due to higher gross profit margin from service and spare parts sales 
due to intense competition  we continue to face pricing pressure that can affect our gross profit margin 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale  material costs and other costs  overhead absorption levels and our revenue recognition requirements 
research  development and engineering 
rd e expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our rd e staff as well as contractors fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and development of new products 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand our portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process  outside service costs  sales commissions  advertising and promotional materials  sales facilities expense  trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administration  operations and general management  headquarters and general office facilities costs  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
in  we continued to adjust our resources through outsourcing in an effort to maintain a more flexible organization that can operate profitably through changing industry cycles 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a million increase in employee compensation and a million increase in stock based compensation as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which were partially offset by a million decrease which related to the release of amounts previously accrued as we completed all remaining obligations under a foreign government funded capital development project  a million decrease related to the release of previously reserved accounts receivable that were collected during the period  a million decrease in outside services and a net decrease in other miscellaneous expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses increased in compared to because of the increased sg a spending in and a decrease in net sales in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses in and were due to our acquisition of vortek in october we estimate our annual amortization expense to be million for the years through gain on disposition of wet business 
in  we concluded all activities related to the disposition of the wet business  and released a remaining accrual of million  which was previously established as an estimate of a portion of the projected costs to fulfill our obligations under the sale of the wet business 
impairment of intangibles 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the book value of certain intangible assets  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the write down represented the remaining book value of certain technology acquired from vortek in october of interest and other income  net 
interest income increased in compared with due to higher cash investment balances in interest expense for and remained minimal 
the million increase in other income  net in compared with was primarily due to a million increase due to foreign currency translation and a million increase in net gains on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes and a million provision for foreign taxes  which includes an incremental million in income tax expense related to a ruling on the applicability of tax law in one of our foreign locations 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes and a million provision for foreign taxes 
in and  we reduced our current tax liability by million and million  respectively  through the utilization of certain acquired tax assets  largely consisting of net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the acquisition of steag in the federal and state tax provisions for and  however  do not reflect a benefit for the utilization of these net operating losses  as it was used to reduce the goodwill originally recorded in the acquisition 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance for all jurisdictions except germany as we have determined that  due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted during if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
such a change in management s expectations could result in a material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting income tax provision

the increase in net sales in compared with was primarily due to a million increase in system sales  or  and a million increase in service and spare parts sales  or 
sales in represented strong growth in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers due to increasing demand in for consumer electronics 
our net sales for included million of royalty revenue from dns  compared with million for international sales accounted for of net sales in  compared to for gross profit and gross profit margin 
the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to our overall increase in sales 
our gross profit for included million of royalty revenue received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of sales 
gross profit margin decreased by percentage points in compared to  percentage points of which decline was due to net deferral of systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  percentage points of which was due to lower gross profit margin from dns and percentage points of which was due to lower gross profit margin from service and spare parts sales  which was partially offset by higher gross profit margin of percentage points which was due to systems sales 
research  development and engineering 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand our portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a million increase in outside service expenses  which related to higher levels of business activity and to the additional audit  legal and other professional expenses efforts needed to complete our form k and restate certain financial statements  a charge of million for stock based compensation in due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  other increased salary and benefits expenses of million primarily due to increased benefits costs  increased travel expenses of million due to higher levels of business activity  and increased support costs for evaluation equipment of million  partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expenses

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes  a million provision for taxes in germany and a provision of million for other foreign taxes 
the tax benefit in primarily consisted of a million benefit due to a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a million benefit from the release of certain foreign tax reserves 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period for the employee 
we previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  in and we recorded stock based compensation cost totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method been applied since the effective date of sfas no 
we did not restate previously reported amounts 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation related to stock options 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation  after estimated forfeitures  related to stock options  which will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation related to our employee stock purchase plan and million and million  respectively  of compensation cost related to restricted stock units 
compensation cost for restricted stock units is determined based on the grant date fair value of the shares of common stock  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation  after estimated forfeitures  related to non vested restricted stock units granted under the equity incentive plan 
we expect to recognize that cost over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million held as of december  stockholders equity at december  was million 
credit arrangements in june  we renewed our million revolving line of credit with a bank  which may be increased to million at our option 
the revolving line of credit now expires in june and has an annual commitment fee of  at december   we were in compliance with all covenants and we had no borrowing under this credit line 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table operating vendor commitments sublease lease payments subcontractor inventory other total income thousands thereafter  other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as discussed in note  on january  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
at december   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  is million related to tax positions and estimated interest and penalties for which it is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations will expire in various foreign jurisdictions within the next twelve months 
in connection with the acquisition of vortek  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under that agreement  as amended  we or vortek agreed to various covenants  including a payment by us of a royalty to the minister of of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million at december   and b vortek maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october  if we  or vortek  do not satisfy our obligations  the minister may demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  less any royalties paid by vortek or us to the minister 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs  and license fees 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   dns has made payments aggregating million under the terms of the settlement and license agreements 
for the years ended december  and december   dns paid us minimum annual royalty payments of million each year 
we have received all scheduled minimum annual royalty payments 
in  and  dns made additional payments of million  million and million  respectively  based on sales by dns for their fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
these additional payments were recorded as royalty revenue when we received notification of the amounts to be paid 
the remaining royalty payment to be paid by dns under the license agreement will be due in june  based on sales by dns through january  the company recognized million  million and million of royalty revenue from dns for the years ended december   and  respectively  which is recognized as net sales in the consolidated income statements 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million increase in other liabilities  a million decrease in inventories delivered systems  million in depreciation and million in stock based compensation  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a million reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash charges of million for impairment of intangibles and million for stock based compensation  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to record sales in the fourth quarter and an increase in inventories of million 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  a decrease in advance billings of million  a decrease in inventories of million and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and noncurrent assets of million 
a significant portion of the change in our balance sheet accounts resulted from a higher level of sales at the end of  which had required increased working capital 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities of million in was primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million

net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for all sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally of the total invoice price  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and title transfer of the tool  and the remaining portion of the total invoice price  generally of the total invoice price  which is due once installation services have been accepted  is not recognized as revenue until final customer acceptance of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customers 
in and earlier periods  revenues associated with sales to customers in japan were recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurred upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of rtp products through our distributor in japan  where we recognized revenues upon title transfer to the distributor 
in december  we expanded our distributor relationship in japan to cover all our products 
under the new distributor agreement  revenues are recognized upon title transfer  which occurs upon shipment to the distributor 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
we recognize service and maintenance contract revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
in  we transitioned our warranty period to months for most systems sales  except where previous customer agreements stated otherwise 
in  we also changed the coverage provided by the warranty to exclude certain consumable maintenance items 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
in  we experienced lower warranty settlements than in prior years  primarily due to a shorter average warranty period in due to the change to a month warranty  a higher proportion of systems under warranty during being second generation mm systems  which have had better performance history and the exclusion of certain consumable maintenance items from warranty in the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with business acquisitions 
the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
a severe decline in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not to be impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
there were no events or changes in circumstances during the first three quarters of that triggered an impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the first step of our annual impairment test based on management estimates and fair value assessments  which did not indicate any impairment  thus  the second step was not necessary 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in and  we did not record any impairment charge 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the book value of an intangible asset  as required by sfas no 
the write down represented the remaining book value of the radiant technology acquired from vortek in october of sabbatical leave benefits 
pursuant to the emerging issues task force eitf conclusion on issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences  we accrue for employee sabbatical leave over the service period in which employees earn the right to sabbatical leave 
we adopted eitf no 
on january  as a change in accounting principle  and we have recorded the cumulative effect of adoption of approximately million as an increase in our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of  as permitted by the transition provisions of eitf no 
income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin became effective for mattson beginning in fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin resulted in a cumulative effect of adoption of million  which was recorded as an increase in our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of at december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of nil and million  respectively  related to our german operations  as we expected that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from the german net deferred tax asset as of december  and for all other tax jurisdictions  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of adjustment 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
total share based compensation for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
for more information on stock based compensation costs for and  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options  restricted stock awards and rights to purchase shares under employee stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value 
we use historical volatility based on past performance of our common stock to estimate expected volatility as we believe historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected future volatility 
if we determine that another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life is more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for share based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected lives result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in and was insignificant 
the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this election is irrevocable 
sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of december  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  because of the short term nature of our portfolio  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates could harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio in the future as securities mature 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments 
foreign currency risk historically  much of our revenues and capital spending has been transacted in us dollars 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period  and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated income statements as they are incurred 
we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during and  we employed a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency fluctuations associated with japanese yen denominated firm purchase commitments and accounts receivable balances 
the goal of the hedging program was to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations associated with the sales of systems to japan and the revaluation gains losses of foreign denominated accounts receivable 
no forward foreign exchange contracts exceeded one year 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these forward contracts did not qualify as designated hedges 
all outstanding forward foreign currency contracts were marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains losses recorded in other income expense  net 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 
at december   we had one outstanding forward foreign exchange contract for the purchase in total of million in exchange for billion japanese yen 
recording the fair value of this contract as of december  resulted in an unrealized gain of million  which was charged to the consolidated income statement in with respect to forward foreign currency exchange contracts  we recorded a net gain of million for  a net gain of million in and a net loss of million for in other income expense  net
