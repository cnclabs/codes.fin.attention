this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview and recent developments since our inception in  we have been engaged in the research and development of technologies related to the formulation of polyurethane compounds and the manufacturing process for producing tires constructed of polyurethane 
we believe that we have developed unique polyurethane formulations that  when used in tire applications  substantially simplify the production process and allow for the creation of products with superior performance characteristics  including abrasion resistance and load bearing capabilities  than conventional rubber tires 
we also believe that the manufacturing processes we have developed to produce polyurethane tires are more efficient than traditional tire manufacturing processes  in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps  extreme heat  and high pressure that are necessary to cure rubber 
using our polyurethane technologies  we believe tires can be p roduced that last longer  are less susceptible to failure and offer improved fuel economy 
our aggregate revenues for the year ended june   june  and june  were million  million and million  respectively  and our aggregate cost of revenues during those same periods were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended june   june  and june   we had net losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to incur significant additional expenses as we expand our business due to increased selling  general and administrative expenditures related to the commercialization of our proprietary polyurethane elastothane or amerifill products 
we expect the increase in revenues from the expanded commercialization activities should reduce net loss in the near term and move us closer to profitability 
while the sale of polyurethane foam tires to original equipment manufacturers  distributors and retail stores continues to account for most of our revenue at this time  elastothane and amerifill are significant to our potential future growth 
we are concentrating on five principal product areas tire fill  low duty cycle tires  solid tires  composite tires and pneumatic tires 
our most recent activities in these areas are set forth below tire fill through research and testing  we have found that our amerifill material is not compatible with most tire fill equipment in use today  therefore our customers must also acquire the necessary tire fill equipment to use our materials 
in order to penetrate this market we are supplying our customers with tire fill equipment at our cost 
profits from this initiative will be derived from the sale of amerifill to our customers 
since launching this program in the spring of  we have supplied a number of fill machines and have now begun to supply the amerifill material 
low duty tires in march  we acquired the manufacturing assets of a well known manufacturer of polyurethane foam tires  kik technology  inc kik 
the acquisition of the kik manufacturing assets gives us the ability to produce a broader range of products for the low duty cycle tire market 
we anticipate this transaction will have positive impact on our future foam tire product revenues 
during the last quarter of fiscal we have focused on integrating the kik products into our product line up 
solid tires on may   we announced we have initiated commercial production of solid polyurethane elastomer tires 
we announced that we have been awarded the production business by oxbo international corporation to supply x solid polyurethane elastomer gage tires for use in farm implements employed in chopping or baling alfalfa or hay 
we estimate the first year volume for the lb 
gage tire is estimated to be  units or approximately  in revenue 
the gage tire represents the first of several solid polyurethane elastomer tire products that we have been developing for the commercial markets 
other potential commercial applications for the solid polyurethane elastomer tires include forklift and aperture tires used in the construction and material handling industry 
we have recently demonstrated the capability of making solid polyurethane elastomer forklift tires at the rate of one tire per minute  using our advanced production technology and hope to see these products go commercial in our fiscal year 
composite tires there are multiple applications for use of our polyurethane elastomer material as treads for new or retread tire casings 
the first commercial application for this technology is being initiated by desert research technology drt  to manufacture paddle type sand tires 
drt has recently commenced commercial production of this product and we have begun to supply drt with the chemical system necessary to produce the tires 
our licensee  qingdao qizhou rubber company  ltd 
qingdao has told us they will not meet their original september deadline for commencing otr tire retreads and we cannot estimate the extent of the delay at this time 
however  once qingdao s otr tire retread facility is operational  qingdao will purchase the polyurethane elastomer chemical systems necessary to produce the otr tire retreads directly from us 
pneumatic tires our arcus run flat tire design successfully completed all testing requirements under federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss successful completion of fmvss testing on our arcus passenger car tire design has been a high priority 
we continue to manufacture prototype passenger car tires to evaluate the properties of the tires in the laboratory and on vehicles 
we have also provided prototype tires to other tire or automotive manufacturers for performance evaluation  which may include uniform tire quality grading or other performance testing and or testing to non us safety standards 
in addition  we have been working to finalize the elements of the manufacturing process that is intended to achieve a production rate of one tire per minute 
we are discussing the construction and installation of a pilot manufacturing facility capable of demonstrating this production capability with potential stra tegic partners 
factors affecting results of operations historically  our operating expenses have exceeded our revenues resulting in net losses of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in each of these periods  our operating expenses consisted primarily of the following cost of sales  which consists primarily of raw materials  components and production of our products  including applied labor costs and benefits expenses  maintenance  facilities and other operating costs associated with the production of our products  selling  general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related benefits paid to our employees and related selling and administrative costs including professional fees  research and development expenses  which consist primarily of equipment and materials used in the development of our technologies  consulting expenses  which consist primarily of amounts paid to third parties for outside services  depreciation and amortization expenses which result from the depreciation of our property and equipment  including amortization of our intangible assets  and amortization of deferred compensation that results from the expense related to certain stock options to our employees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventory valuation  deferred compensation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following accounting policies are our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that may be uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition revenue for products is recognized when the sales amount is determined  shipment of goods to the customer has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship all of our products fob origination 
license fee revenue is recognized as earned  and no revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill at june   we had capitalized patent and trademark costs totaling  the patents which have been granted are being amortized over a period of years 
patents which are pending or are being developed are not amortized until a patent has been issued 
amortization expense for the fiscal years ended june   and was   and  respectively 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangibles and review the amortization period on a continual basis utilizing the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test our patents and trademarks for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we consider the following indicators  among others  when determining whether or not our patents are impaired any changes in the market relating to the patents that would decrease the life of the asset  any adverse change in the extent or manner in which the patents are being used  any significant adverse change in legal factors relating to the use of the patents  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with our history of operating or cash flow losses  future cash flow values based on the expectation of commercialization through licensing  and current expectations that  more likely than not  the patents will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost computed on a first in  first out basis or market 
the inventory consists of chemicals  finished goods produced in our plant and products purchased for resale 
stock based compensation equity securities issued for services rendered have been accounted for at the fair market value of the securities on the date of authorization 
on july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share based payments to employees and directors  including employee stock options and stock purchases related to our employee stock option and award plans 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for periods beginning in the fiscal year ended june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of july   the first day of our fiscal year ended june  our financial statements as of and for the period ended june    and reflect the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ending june  was  related to employee stock options granted during the year 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ending june  and june  was  and  respectively 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our statement of operations 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
at june   we had no unvested share based payment awards that required the recognition of compensation expense during the fiscal year ended june  stock based compensation expense recognized in our statement of operations for the fiscal years ended june    and is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r  and only includes compensation expense for share based payment awards that were granted after july  and vested during the fiscal year ended june    and stock based compensation expense recognized in our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june    and assumes all awards will vest 
therefore  no reduction has been made for estimated forfeitures 
the valuation of options and warrants granted to unrelated parties for services are measured as of the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached  or the date the counterparty s performance is complete 
pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force no 
 the options and warrants will be revalued in situations where they are granted prior to the completion of the performance 
seasonality a substantial majority of our sales are to customers within the united states 
we experience some seasonality in the sale of our closed cell polyurethane foam tires for bicycles and lawn and garden products because sales of these products generally decline during the winter months in the united states 
sales of our closed cell polyurethane form tire products generally peak during the spring and summer months  typically resulting in greater sales volumes during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
results of operations our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our revenues and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include sales revenue  net of returns and trade discounts  which is an indicator of our overall business growth and the success of our sales and marketing efforts  gross profit  which is an indicator of both competitive pricing pressures and the cost of sales of our products  growth in our customer base  which is an indicator of the success of our sales efforts  and distribution of revenue across our products offered 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and with respect to certain key financial measures 
the comparisons illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below

year ended june  compared to the year ended june  net revenues 
sales of our closed cell polyurethane foam products accounted for of all of our sales revenue during the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june  we had  of net polyurethane foam product sales compared to  for net polyurethane foam product sales for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  as compared with due primarily to a slightly lower demand resulting primarily from weakness in the consumer markets reflecting uncertainty in global economic conditions 
our number of product units sold to our original equipment manufacturer  retail chain and distributor customers increased only over the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   we had  and  of returns of our products and trade discounts  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for t he fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   we had  of revenues derived from licensing fees  or of total net revenues  compared to  of revenues derived from licensing fees  or of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  also  during the fiscal year ended june   we had  of revenues derived from sales of equipment  or of total net revenues  compared to  of revenues derived from sales of equipment  or of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  the substantial decrease in sales of equipment for fiscal as compared to fiscal is entirely related to the sale of pouring equipment to qingdao during fiscal  while equipment sales during fiscal all relate to the sale of tire fill equipment 
cost of revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   our cost of revenues related to our closed cell polyurethane foam products increased  compared to due to a substantial increase in raw material costs 
as a result of these cost increases  our gross margin for products sales decreased slightly to from the prior year 
we have revised the selling prices for our products to pass raw material increases to our customers 
we believe that our product sales margin can continue to improve as our increased sales efforts generate additional product orders to take further advantage of manufacturing efficiencies 
we believe we currently have sufficient foam product manufacturing equipment and employees to put into affect a substantial increase in production without incurring proportionately equivalent increases in labor costs or manufacturing equipment overheads 
in fiscal  we began supplying fill equipment to our customers on a break even basis to penetrate the tire fill market 
due to some unexpected ancillary expenses  this initiative has cost us  for the fiscal year ended june   we had  in revenues from the sale of equipment but  in cost of revenues related to specialized one of a kind pouring equipment sold to qingdao 
this cost of this equipment also exceeded our estimate due to the unique characteristics of the equipment 
based on our experience to date  we intend to plan for cost contingencies and change orders when providing customers with equipment quotes on new or specialized equipment 
gross profit 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had  of total gross profit compared to  for the gross profit related to our closed cell polyurethane foam products represents  or  of the total gross profit 
the additional gross profit of  resulted from licensing fees and equipment sales 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  as compared with due primarily to a decrease in licensing fees and a small decrease in net sales from our closed cell polyurethane foam products 
however  our gross profit margin increased to in from in due primarily to the decrease in loss associated with sales of equipment as explained above 
for the fiscal year ending june   we believe that the contingency measures relating to equipment costs described above coupled with an improving consumer market should enab le us to increase our product and equipment sales while maintaining the gross margins we experienced during the fiscal years ended june  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had  of sg a expenses  including the amortization of deferred compensation  compared to  for as we focused our commercialization efforts  our sg a for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  as compared with due primarily to decreased expenses in the following areas approximately  in payroll and payroll taxes  approximately  in sales and marketing expenses  approximately  in travel entertainment not associated with product development and marketing expenses  the decreases were offset by increases of approximately  in facilities related expenses  approximately  for office related expenses  and approximately  in professional fees  and approximately  in insurance expenses in addition to the sg a expenses listed above  we had deferred compensation  which is primarily related to the grant of options to our employees for the purchase of restricted stock 
we adopted sfas r on july  and as a result  we amortized  of deferred compensation compared to  for in the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses 
for the fiscal year ended june  we had  of research and development expenses compared to  for our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  as compared with due primarily to us not have to make significant cash investments in research and development tooling and equipment 
we expect research and development expenses to maintain during the fiscal year ending june  as we continue to identify and pursue additional applications for our polyurethane technology outside the tire industry 
consulting expenses 
for the fiscal year ended june  we had  of consulting expenses compared to  for during the fiscal year ending june   our consulting expenses increased primarily due to our entering into a consulting agreement with our former chief executive officer  effective september   and a consulting agreement with our former chief chemical systems formulator  effective may  we incurred  in consulting expenses for the fiscal year ended june  due primarily to costs associated with outside consulting services with our marketing and capital raising efforts and on other operational strategies 
in additional  we incurred  in outside consulting expenses associated with our search for a new chief executive officer 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
for the fiscal year ended june  we had  of depreciation and amortization expenses compared to  for our depreciation and amortization expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  as compared with due primarily to no longer expensing fully depreciated assets  partially offset by the depreciation expense for newly acquired assets during the period 
net loss 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for our net loss for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  as compared with due primarily to the reduction in payroll and payroll taxes  sales and marketing  research and development  and other general and administrative expenses partially offset by the increase in professional fees  facilities related expenses  office related expenses  and consulting services 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  net revenues 
sales of our closed cell polyurethane foam products accounted for of all of our sales revenue during the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june  we had  of net revenues compared to  for net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or  as compared with due primarily to a increase in the number of product units sold to our original equipment manufacturer  retail chain and distributor customers through increased sales activities of our sales staff 
during the fiscal year ended june   we had  and  of returns of our products and trade discounts  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   we had  of revenues derived from licensing fees  or of total net revenues 
also  dur ing the fiscal year ended june   we had  of revenues derived from sales of equipment  or of total net revenues 
there were no revenues derived from licensing fees and sales of equipment during the year ended june  cost of revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   our cost of revenues related to our closed cell polyurethane foam products increased  or  compared to due to a substantial increase in product sales 
in  our gross margin increased to from the prior year due primarily to our successful efforts to obtain reduced raw materials pricing 
we obtained reduced raw material pricing during the second half of fiscal year ended june  and did not experience material increases in raw material pricing in fiscal for the fiscal year ended june   we had  in cost of revenues related to specialty pouring equipment supplied to one of our foreign licensees 
the cost was greater than the sale price for the equipment quoted by us to our customer  in part because the equipment was unique and had to be custom fabricated 
the cost of the equipment exceeded our original estim ates due to modification and unexpected expenses incurred during the production of the equipment 
gross profit 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had  of total gross profit compared to  for the gross profit related to our closed cell polyurethane foam products represents  or  of the total gross profit 
the additional gross profit of  resulted from licensing fees and equipment sales

our gross profit margin increased to in from in due to the improvement in our closed cell polyurethane foam product sales margin and the receipt of licensing revenues with no associated cost of sales  offset by a small loss associated with sales of specialty equipment 
during the fiscal year ending june   we believe that the foregoing mea sures may allow us to maintain the gross margin we experienced during the fiscal year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had  of sg a expenses  including the amortization of deferred compensation  compared to  for as we focused our commercialization efforts  our sg a for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or  as compared with due primarily to increased expenses in the following areas approximately  in sales and marketing expenses  approximately  in facilities related expenses  approximately  in professional fees  approximately  in insurance expenses and business taxes  and approximately  in directors fees and expenses 
the increases were offset by decreases of approximately  in payroll and payroll taxes for existing management personnel  approximately  for office related expenses  and approximately  in travel and related expenses not associated with product development and marketing expenses 
in addition to the sg a expenses listed above  we had deferred compensation  which is primarily related to the grant of options to our employees for the purchase of restricted stock

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents and payments received from our customers 
we have no long term liabilities  and we do not have any significant credit arrangements 
historically  our expenses have exceeded our revenues  resulting in operating losses 
from time to time  we have obtained additional liquidity to fund our operations through the sale of shares of our common stock 
in assessing our liquidity  our management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances on hand  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital expenditure commitments and other obligations 
cash flows the following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash used by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents during period net cash used by operating activities 
our primary sources of operating cash in fiscal were receipts from our customers and cash provided by prior year financing activities 
our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors  employees and technical consultants 
net cash used by operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cash used in operating activities is due primarily to a large increase in other assets deposits on equipment and project in process  and large decrease accounts payable and accrued expenses 
non cash items include depreciation and amortization and the issuance of common stock and stock options for services and employee compensation 
our net loss was  for the year ended june  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended june  net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  our primary use of investing cash for the fiscal year ended june  was  for patents and trademarks and  for property and equipment 
also  during the year  we received for proceeds from the sale of equipment 
our primary uses of investing cash for the fiscal year ended june  were  for patents and trademarks and  for property and equipment 
our only source of cash for the fiscal year ended june  was receipts from customers 
our primary source of cash for the fiscal year ended june  was  obtained from the sale of common stock  issuance of common stock for warrants and cash from exercise stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities 
there were no financing activities during the fiscal year ended june  financing activities provided net cash of  for the fiscal year ended june of the  in net cash provided by financing activities during   was associated with the proceeds from our private placement in march and may of   in cash proceeds from stock issued for warrants  and the net amount of  in connection with exercise of stock options 
cash position and outstanding indebtedness our total indebtedness at june  was  and our total cash and cash equivalents were  none of which is restricted 
our total indebtedness at june  includes  in accounts payable and  in accrued expenses 
we have no long term liabilities 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at june  payments due by period total less than year to years to years after years facility lease total contractual cash obligations in november  we negotiated an extension of the lease for our executive and manufacturing facilities located at industrial road  boulder city  nevada 
the property consists of a  square foot building  which includes approximately  square feet of office space  situated on approximately acres 
the extension term of the lease is years expiring november  the base rent is  per month subject to annual adjustments based on the consumer price index 
future capital requirements at june   we had approximately million available to finance our operations plus approximately  in accounts receivable 
our cash used in operations for fiscal was in an effort to increase revenues  we have recently expanded our product lines and begun the sale of polyurethane foam tire fill and solid polyurethane elastomer tires 
in december  we offered aggressive sales projections based on our assessment of our planned sales initiatives 
we believe the increased revenues reported for the current fiscal quarter are only beginning to reflect our progress toward our sales projections  which we anticipate will become more apparent during our fiscal year ending june  although we believe that we will successfully implement our business plan to provide for additional revenues to offset operating costs  management cannot give any assurances that it will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably 
our business plan assumes  among other things  that our revenues will increase from the sale of the new product lines  our raw materials expenses may increase  and our expenses from operations will continue at a rate similar to the rate we experienced for year ended june  to supplement our cash needs during the fiscal year  we intend to issue common stock in lieu of cash as compensation for employment  development and other professional services when possible and seek project funding for business and technology development outside our core operations 
until such time as our net income exceeds our expense from operation  we will need additional capital 
when necessary  we will seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
our ability to obtain financing through the offer and sale of our securities is subject to market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
if we do seek additional capital  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts
