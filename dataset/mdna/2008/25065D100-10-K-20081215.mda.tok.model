item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we are the leading designer and retailer of maternity apparel in the united states with  retail locations  including stores in all states  puerto rico  guam and canada and leased departments 
during fiscal  we operated our stores under the motherhood maternity  mimi maternity  a pea in the pod and destination maternity retail concepts and also sold our merchandise on the internet at our maternitymall 
com and our brand specific websites  as well as through an exclusive product and license agreement with kohl s 
in addition to our stores  our retail locations include leased departments within department and specialty stores 
we design and contract manufacture approximately of the merchandise we sell 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  future reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories 
we value our inventories  which consist primarily of maternity apparel  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method fifo and includes the cost of merchandise  freight  duty and broker fees 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current analysis of merchandise based on receipt date  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by us to quantify aging trends include factors such as the amount of merchandise received within the past twelve months  merchandise received more than one year before with quantities on hand in excess of months of sales  and merchandise currently selling below cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements included in the property  plant and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and  to a much lesser extent  lease acquisition costs included in the other intangible assets  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life 
net long lived assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as i store concept  that is  motherhood  mimi  a pea in the pod or destination maternity  ii store location  for example  urban area versus suburb  iii current marketplace awareness of our brands  iv local customer demographic data  v anchor stores within the mall in which our store is located and vi current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which is assumed to be within two years from the date a store location is opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
as a result of our impairment assessment  we recorded write downs of long lived assets of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
goodwill 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of both september  and  goodwill totaled million  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or as impairment indicators arise 
the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of applying sfas no 
based on our reporting structure 
as of september   our book value was per share of outstanding common stock and the closing trading price of our common stock was per share 
the fair value of our single reporting unit is determined based on a combination of the fair market value of our outstanding common stock on a control basis  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies and  if necessary  an outside independent valuation is obtained to determine the fair value 
the carrying value of our single reporting unit  expressed on a per share basis  is represented by the book value per share of our outstanding common stock 
the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of september   and indicated the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
as part of our impairment analysis as of september   an outside independent valuation was obtained and the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
if the per share fair value of our single reporting unit was less than the book value per share on september   our goodwill would have been impaired 
our goodwill may also need to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to substantial volatility subsequent to september  and is currently trading near historically low prices 
consequently  if our stock price does not increase in the near term  our goodwill would likely be impaired and we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations  but would not have any adverse effect on the covenant calculations of our debt agreements or our overall compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements 
accounting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective as of october  see notes to consolidated financial statements  note income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure including interest and penalties together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but such tax positions are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain of the states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material and adverse effect on our net income or cash flow 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
net deferred tax assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
accounting for contingencies 
from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  including the provisions of emerging issues task force issue d  accounting for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
an interpretation of sfas no 
further states that when there is a range of loss and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other  then the minimum amount of the range shall be accrued 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management  after consultation with outside legal counsel  to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
restructuring on july   we announced that we were streamlining our merchandise brands and store nameplates and implementing cost reductions in order to simplify our business model  reduce overhead costs and improve and tighten our merchandise assortments 
pursuant to the strategic restructuring  we are rebranding our mimi maternity merchandise brand under our a pea in the pod brand beginning with the spring collection  which initially debuted in november we also plan to streamline our store nameplates  which began in november  by renaming our single brand mimi maternity stores as a pea in the pod  and by renaming our multi brand mimi maternity stores as destination maternity 
we incurred pre tax expense of approximately million from our restructuring and cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of approximately million for cash severance expense and severance related benefits  and approximately million of non cash expense for accelerated depreciation of existing store signs resulting from planned store signage changes 
approximately million of non cash expense for additional accelerated depreciation is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to realize approximately million of annualized pre tax expense savings from the cost reductions associated with our strategic restructuring actions  and we began to realize these savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal leased departments as we disclosed in september  we were unable to reach terms on a renewal of our relationship with sears and  as a result  our relationship with sears ended on june   resulting in the closure of our leased departments within sears stores 
even after the end of the sears relationship  we remain well positioned to service the needs of our customers through our own stores as well as through our exclusive licensed relationship and our other leased departments 
after our relationship with sears ended  the two hearts maternity brand remained our exclusive property

our net sales for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in sales versus last year resulted primarily from a decrease in sales from the company s leased department and licensed relationships  largely due to a decrease in sears leased department sales due to the closure of all of the remaining leased departments within sears stores during june  as well as reduced sales volume from the ongoing closure of certain underperforming stores  partially offset by increased internet sales and a slight increase in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales increased by during fiscal  based on retail locations  versus a comparable store sales decrease of during fiscal  based on  retail locations

gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects increased markdowns to help manage our inventory level  product cost inflation pressures that are being felt throughout the apparel industry  and the effect of spreading fixed product overhead costs over a smaller sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal this decrease in expense resulted primarily from significantly lower legal expenses  and from lower store occupancy  payroll and employee benefits costs  as a result of our reduced number of stores and leased departments

income taxes 
our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal  compared to a benefit of in fiscal our income tax rate for fiscal reflects the effect of additional income tax expense including interest and penalties being recognized in connection with the implementation and ongoing accounting requirements of fin no

our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were equal to fiscal  at million for both fiscal years 
significantly lower variable incentive compensation costs  and lower store occupancy expenses  as a result of our store closings and our new multi brand stores  were offset by increased legal expenses that were primarily related to certain intellectual property disputes  increased employee benefits costs and increased payroll expenses

liquidity and capital resources our cash needs have primarily been for i debt service  ii capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for new stores  store relocations and expansions of our existing stores  as well as improvements and new equipment for our distribution and corporate facilities and information systems  and iii working capital  including inventory to support our business 
we have historically financed these capital requirements from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility or available cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal compared to a decrease of million during fiscal cash provided by operations of million for fiscal increased by million from million for fiscal this increase in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of working capital changes that provided more cash in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in inventories in fiscal  partially offset by the larger net loss and smaller loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal compared to fiscal total inventories as of september  were million  a decrease of million or below the million inventories balance as of september  during fiscal we used the majority of our cash provided by operations to pay for capital expenditures 
for fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
we funded repayments of long term debt in fiscal  including million of prepayments of our term loan  by using the remaining cash provided by operations and the cash received from the grantor trust related to amendments to certain supplemental executive retirement agreements as described later in this section 
cash provided by operations of million for fiscal decreased by million from million for fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of an increase in inventories in fiscal compared to cash generated from a decrease in inventories during fiscal total inventories as of september  were million  an increase of million or above the million inventories balance as of september  during fiscal we used a significant amount of our cash provided by operations to pay for capital expenditures 
for fiscal we spent million in capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our distribution and corporate facilities and information systems 
we funded the million repurchase of our senior notes in december by utilizing available cash  cash generated by net proceeds from the sales net of purchases of short term investments  cash generated from stock option exercises  as well as the remaining cash provided by operations 
on december   we completed the repurchase of million principal amount of our senior notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on april   we completed the redemption of the remaining million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes through a new term loan financing 
the december and april redemptions of the senior notes  which were both at a price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest  resulted in loss on extinguishment of debt of million on a pre tax basis  consisting of the million cash redemption premium and million of non cash expense from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt issuance costs 
on march   we entered into a term loan agreement for a million senior secured term loan b due march   the proceeds of which were received on april  and were used to redeem the remaining million principal amount of our senior notes 
the new term loan extended the maturity for million principal amount of our debt from august  the maturity date of the redeemed senior notes to march  the maturity date of the new term loan 
the interest rate on the term loan is equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii the libor rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings is either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratio during fiscal  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings remained at for fiscal we are required to make minimum repayments of the principal amount of the term loan in quarterly installments of  each 
we are also required to make an annual principal repayment equal to or of excess cash flow as defined in excess of  for each fiscal year  with the or factor depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the required principal repayment for fiscal  which was calculated based on the factor  is  and is due in december additionally  the term loan can be prepaid at our option  in part or in whole  at any time without any prepayment premium or penalty 
on march   we prepaid million of the outstanding term loan and on june  we prepaid million of the outstanding term loan 
at september   our indebtedness under the term loan agreement was million 
the term loan is secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory  real estate interests  letter of credit rights  cash  intangibles and certain other assets 
the security interest granted to the term lenders is  in certain respects  subordinate to the security interest granted to the credit facility lender 
the term loan agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and enter into other various types of transactions 
the term loan agreement also contains quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio and a specified minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined 
since the inception of the term loan agreement we have been in compliance with all covenants of our term loan agreement 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april   the date the million term loan proceeds were received  and expires on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate of libor plus subject to reduction to libor plus if we achieve a specified leverage ratio  to a fixed interest rate of subject to reduction to if we achieve a specified leverage ratio for the significant majority of the term loan 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next eighteen months decreases as follows to million starting october   to million starting april   and to million starting october  in connection with the term loan transaction  we amended our existing million revolving credit facility in order to permit the new term loan financing 
this amendment of the credit facility also extended its maturity from october  to march   increased its size to million  and reduced the libor based interest rate option under the facility by 
there are no financial covenant requirements under the credit facility provided that excess availability as defined does not fall below of the borrowing base as defined 
if excess availability were to fall below of the borrowing base  we would be required to meet a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined 
during all of fiscal and fiscal  we exceeded the minimum requirements for excess availability under the credit facility 
as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line based on borrowing base limitations  compared to no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line as of september  borrowings under the credit facility as of september  would have borne interest at a rate of between approximately and per annum 
during fiscal and  our average level of direct borrowings under the credit facility was million and million  respectively 
we expect that we will have borrowings under our credit facility during certain periods of fiscal  reflecting seasonal and other timing variations in cash flow 
in march  we entered into supplemental executive retirement agreements the serp agreements with our chairman of the board and former chief executive officer and our president and chief creative officer the serp executives 
in april  we made an initial required contribution of million to a grantor trust  which was established for the purpose of accumulating assets in anticipation of our payment obligations under the serp agreements 
in november  we made an additional required contribution to the grantor trust of million 
in order to impact positively our ability to comply with the consolidated leverage ratio covenant of our term loan agreement at march   with the consent of the serp executives we withdrew million from the grantor trust on march  the withdrawn funds were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility 
on may   we entered into i a letter agreement with the serp executives and the trustee for the grantor trust the trustee  and ii an amendment to the grantor trust agreement with the trustee collectively  the agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk destination maternity corporation is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash equivalents consist of money market accounts that bear interest at variable rates 
a change in market interest rates earned on our investments impacts the interest income and cash flows  but does not materially impact the fair market value of the financial instruments 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
as of september   the principal components of our debt portfolio were the million term loan and the million credit facility  both of which are denominated in us dollars 
our credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
as of september   we had no direct borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum as of september  any future borrowings under the credit facility would  to the extent of outstanding borrowings  be affected by changes in market interest rates 
a change in market interest rates on the variable rate portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest expense incurred and cash flows 
the term loan carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
the sensitivity analysis as it relates to this portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels as of september   with all other variables held constant 
the debt value of the term loan is approximately million 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense on the term loan of approximately million 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly lower our annual interest expense on the term loan by approximately million 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus at inception  to a fixed interest rate at inception 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
based on the scheduled swap notional amount during the next months of the swap agreement  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in interest expense savings for the year of approximately million related to the swap agreement 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly increase our interest expense for the year by approximately million related to the swap agreement 
thus  a basis point increase in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would result in additional interest expense for the year of approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
a basis point decline in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
based on the limited other variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of september   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in additional interest incurred for the year of less than million 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by less than million 
other than as described above  we do not believe that the market risk exposure on other financial instruments is material
