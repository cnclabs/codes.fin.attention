table of contents part i item business overview we are a leading specialty contractor operating mainly throughout the united states and across a range of industries 
our core activities are the building  installation  maintenance and upgrade of communications and utility infrastructure 
our primary customers are in the following industries communications including satellite television and cable television  utilities and government 
we provide similar infrastructure services across the industries we serve 
our customers rely on us to build and maintain infrastructure and networks that are critical to their transportation and delivery of voice  video and data communications  electricity and other energy resources 
we  or our predecessor companies  have been in business for over years 
we offer our services under the mastec service mark and operate through a network of approximately locations and  employees as of december  providing services to communication industries  utility industries and government markets  we have consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by engineering news record 
our customers include some of the largest communication and utility companies in the united states  including directv  verizon  at t  embarq  progress energy  florida power light  txu  qwest  xto energy  and dominion virginia power 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were from our ten largest customers 
we have longstanding relationships with many customers and often provide services under multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived under multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
industry trends our industry is comprised of national  regional and local companies that provide outsourced infrastructure services to customers in the communications and utilities industries as well as government customers 
we believe the following industry trends impact demand for our services demand for voice  video and data services 
demand for faster and more robust voice  video and data services has increased significantly with the proliferation of the internet  broadband  video and music download services  high definition television and other advanced video services 
to serve this developing market and the ever increasing need for more bandwidth  voice  video and data service providers are upgrading the performance of their networks or deploying new networks 
investment is facilitated by declining equipment costs and expanded capabilities of wireline and wireless network equipment 
in addition  the service offerings of our customers are converging as telephone and cable providers increasingly seek to deploy networks that allow them to provide bundled voice  and advanced video and data services to their customers 
verizon  at t  qwest and numerous regional and rural telecommunication companies are upgrading their networks from copper line to fiber optic line in order to enhance their ability to provide full bundled service offerings 
cable companies continue to upgrade their systems to provide for enhanced broadband services  including voice over internet protocol  commonly called voip  as well as improved video offerings  including digital television  high definition television  video on demand and digital video recording 
satellite television subscriptions and installations have grown substantially over the last five years as the industry has gained acceptance in part through offering attractive programming such as nfl sunday ticket  nascar hotpass  and other exclusive sports offerings as well as high definition television and digital video recorder capabilities 
increased outsourcing of network infrastructure installation and maintenance 
we provide specialized services that are labor and equipment intensive 
we believe that communications companies view outsourcing as an opportunity to reduce expenses  manage capital costs and stay competitive 

table of contents inadequacy of existing electric power transmission and distribution networks 
the united states electric transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance  upgrades and extensions to manage powerline congestion  avoid delivery failures and connect distribution lines to new end users 
despite significant spending since  the pace of transmission investment has lagged behind total electricity generation investment 
such underinvestment  combined with ever increasing load demand  contributed to the blackouts  brownouts and rolling blackouts nationwide since  which have periodically left millions in the united states without electricity 
as a result  we believe that transmission and distribution spending will continue and likely rise in the near future in order to meet the increasing needs of customers 
according to a edison electric institute report  transmission and distribution spending in the us is expected to average approximately billion annually through alternative energy projects 
as utilities search for more environmentally sensitive ways to generate electrical power  the number of alternative energy generation projects  such as wind and solar collection farms  has been expanding rapidly 
according to the american wind energy association  in the th quarter of  the us had  megawatts of installed wind farm generating capacity with another  megawatts currently under construction 
these projects are often located in areas where there is no other generation capacity 
we believe that extensive collection and transmission projects are necessary to connect these projects to the electrical grid 
increased funding for energy projects 
the energy policy act of and the energy independence and security act of were passed to develop more reliable supply chains and distribution channels for us energy resources 
among other things  the energy policy act facilitates the siting  environmental compliance  construction and financing of more reliable electrical grid components 
the energy independence and security act promotes a number of research and development initiatives that could lead to increased spending on the nations energy infrastructure and the facilitation of the development of alternative energy projects 
as a result  we believe that transmission and distribution spending will likely rise in the near future in order to meet the increasing needs of consumers and businesses

we also believe our reputation for technical expertise gives us an advantage in competing for new work from the home installation customers 
experienced management team 
our management team  which includes our chief executive officer  chief operating officer  service group presidents and financial officers  plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining long term relationships with our customers  supporting the growth of our business and managing the financial aspects of our operations 
our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and service group presidents have a deep understanding of our customers and their requirements 

table of contents strategy the key elements of our business strategy are as follows capitalize on favorable industry trends 
many of our customers have increased spending on their network infrastructure in order to enhance their ability to offer voice  video and data services  deliver electric power or other energy resources 
in addition  many companies are increasing outsourcing network installation and maintenance work 
we intend to increase the percentage of business derived from large  financially stable customers in the communications and utility industries 
we also intend to use our national presence and full range of services to capitalize on these trends to generate additional revenue from existing and new customers 
operate more efficiently

we intend to continue to capture operating efficiencies and improve working capital management in order to increase our operating margins and cash flows 
improve our financial strength 
we have increased our financial resources in recent years with receipt of the net proceeds from the public offering of our common stock in and the offering of our senior notes in these actions have significantly improved our financial condition 
we believe these improvements to our financial condition have enhanced our credit worthiness and support our ability to reduce our collateral requirements for our surety bonds and insurance policies

customers our primary customers are in the communications  utilities industries and the government markets 
we provide similar infrastructure services across the industries we serve 
for the year ended december    and of our revenues were from customers in the communications  utilities and government industries  respectively 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  verizon and at t  respectively 
we have longstanding relationships with many customers and often provide services under multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived under master service agreements and other service agreements 
while our multi year master service agreements and other service agreements generally do not guarantee a specific level of work and are generally cancelable upon short notice  the agreements have historically been an important contributor to our revenue and backlog 

table of contents we believe that our industry experience  technical expertise and customer service are important to our being retained by large communications and utility companies and governments 
the relationships developed between these customers and our senior management and project management teams are also important to our being retained 
backlog at december  and december   our month backlog was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
we expect to realize approximately of our backlog in approximately of our backlog at december  was comprised of services to be performed under existing master service agreements and long term contracts 
the balance is our estimate of work to be completed on other service agreements 
sales and marketing we market our services individually and in combination with other companies to provide what we believe is the most efficient and effective solution to meet our customers demands  which increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines 
through our unified mastec brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor  equipment and materials  we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs 
we have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the mastec registered service mark and an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions  providing services ranging from basic installation to sophisticated engineering  design and integration 
we believe our long standing relationships with our customers and reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business 
our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our service groups in coordination with our corporate marketing organization 
our management team has many years of industry experience  both at the service provider level and in some cases with the customers we serve 
our service group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also market our company to be placed on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects 
our executive management supplements these efforts at the national level 
safety and insurance risk management we strive to instill safe work habits in our employees 
we require our employees to participate in internal training and service programs relevant to their employment and to complete any training programs required by law 
we evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise 
we have established a company wide safety program to share best practices and to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations 
our business involves heavy equipment and exposure to conditions that can be dangerous 
while we are committed to operating safely and prudently  we are subject to claims by employees  customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work 
see item a 
risk factors our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition 
we presently maintain insurance policies subject to per claim deductibles of million for our workers compensation policy  million for our general liability policy and million for our automobile liability policy 
we have excess umbrella coverage of up to million per claim and in the aggregate 
we also maintain an insurance policy with respect to employee group health claims subject to per claim deductibles of  after satisfying an annual deductible of  see item a 
risk factors we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
we are required to periodically post letters of credit and provide cash collateral to our insurance carriers related to our insurance programs 
total outstanding letters of credit amounted to million and cash collateral posted amounted to million at december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates insurance reserves 
suppliers  materials and working capital under most of our contracts  our customers supply the necessary materials and supplies and we are responsible for installation  but not for material costs or material warranties 
under certain of our contracts we acquire materials and supplies for our own account from third party providers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for materials or supplies and have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 

table of contents we utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage work flow 
our independent contractors are typically sole proprietorships or small business entities that provide their own vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
see item a 
risk factors we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying  us for the related services 
we need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business  primarily due to the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work  including storm restoration work  and the corresponding spending by our customers on their annual capital expenditure budgets 
our business is typically slower in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year and stronger in the second and third quarters 
we generally experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately april through september to support growth in unbilled revenue and accounts receivable  and to a lesser extent  inventory 
our billing terms are generally net to days  although some contracts allow our customers to retain a portion from to of the contract amount until the contract is completed to their satisfaction 
we maintain inventory to meet the material requirements of some of our contracts 
some of our customers pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects  or allow us to pre bill them for materials purchases up to a specified amount 
competition our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
we often compete with a number of companies in markets where we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
the national or large regional firms that compete with us include dycom industries  inc  pike electric  inc 
and quanta services  inc 
relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
some of our customers employ personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide 
we compete based upon our industry experience  technical expertise  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and customer service 
while we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider  most of their work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
regulation we are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally  including laws and regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
while many of our customers operate in regulated industries for example  utilities regulated by the public service commission or broadband companies regulated by franchise agreements with various municipalities  we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight 
as a contractor  our operations are subject to various laws  including regulations related to vehicle registrations  including those of state and the united states departments of transportation  regulations related to worker safety and health  including those established by the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  building and electrical codes  and permitting and inspection requirements 
we are also subject to various environmental laws 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
for example  some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 

table of contents we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
see item a 
risk factors our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
we believe we have all licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if we fail to comply with any material applicable regulatory requirements  we could incur significant liabilities 
see item a 
risk factors our failure to comply with regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
we offer services and are branded under the mastec service mark 
we do not have any patents that are material to our business

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry and our customers industries an economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve may result in a decrease in demand for our services 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  a number of key economic indicators including the consumer confidence index  us leading index  consumer price index cpi  and total new housing starts have been trending downward and pointing in the direction of a potential economic downturn during because we have been negatively impacted by previous economic downturns  we constantly monitor our customers industries and their relative health compared to the economy as a whole 
the aforementioned reduction in new housing starts  should it continue during  could negatively impact our customers who utilize our services to construct their last mile of infrastructure 
continued reductions in new housing starts  which generally follow overall economic trends  could result in the cancellation of certain projects or a reduction in the utilization of our services until these sectors of the economy improve 
additionally  our customers who provide satellite communications to consumers across the country could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate that we and our customers anticipate 
moreover  during an economic downturn  our customers may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure at their current levels 
a decrease in either last mile projects  new subscriptions and upgrades or any other services we provide could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demand for our services 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications industry 
the communications industry is subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
new or developing technologies could displace the wire line systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow communications 
table of contents providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
additionally  the communications industry has been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers 
utilities have also entered into a phase of consolidation similar to the communications industry which could lead to the same uncertainties 
our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our industry is highly fragmented  and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 
most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction in their demand for our services could impair our financial performance 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  verizon  and at t  respectively 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t  and verizon  respectively 
in addition  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  our revenue could significantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced  which could result in reduced profitability and liquidity 
our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable to pay for our services 
in the past  we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain industry specific factors that worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers 
see risks related to our industry and our customers industries  specifically the risk factor entitled an economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve may result in a decrease in demand for our services 
in  and total provisions for bad debts aggregated to million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  resulted from anticipated legal settlements and discontinued operations 
as of december   we had remaining receivables from customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling million  of which million is included in specific reserves for bad debts  with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered through secured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds 
most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
under our multi year master service agreements and other service agreements  we contract to provide customers with individual project services  through work orders  within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis 
under these agreements  our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in our revenue  profitability and liquidity 

table of contents we recorded an unrealized loss in to reduce the carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold  and we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction rate securities in future periods 
the current overall credit concerns in capital markets may affect our ability to liquidate certain securities that we classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet 
as of december   we have identified approximately million of investments subject to this auction process for which there have been insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover dates and held another approximately million of these securities 
as a result  we recorded an unrealized loss of million in subsequent to year end  of the approximately million of these securities  approximately million were sold at par  approximately million had insufficient bidders and failed the reset process  and we believe the remaining approximately million may be at risk of having this occur 
while the investments are of a high credit quality and the rating of these securities has not been lowered  at this time we are uncertain when the liquidity issues associated with these investments will improve  when we will be able to exit these investments at their par value or whether we will incur any additional losses as a result of these investments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  so our revenue is not guaranteed 
most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are periodically open to public bid 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenue  profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
we may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed price contracts which could impair our financial performance 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and other service agreements that are fixed price contracts 
under these contracts  we set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
in addition to master or other service agreements we enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under those agreements  we have also contractually agreed to a price per unit 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated costs on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor 
certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates  which could reduce our profitability and liquidity 
we recognize revenue for our installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  therefore  variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
we recognize revenue on long term installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
the percentage of completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material 
we immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity 
for example  for the years ended december   and  we incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  of losses on percentage of completion contracts 
for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  were included in loss from discontinued operations 

table of contents amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits 
approximately of our month backlog at december  was comprised of master service agreements and other service agreements which do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
these backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period  or at all 
in addition  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
if our backlog fails to materialize  we could experience a reduction in our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
the budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services customers end december as a result  some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the united states 
as a result  we experience reduced revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the united states could also have a negative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions  which could result in a decline in profitability and liquidity 
we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  those policies are subject to high deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability  liquidity and availability under our credit facility 
because of factors such as increases in claims  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
an increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility 
some of our contracts require performance and surety bonds 
bonding capacity in the infrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain  and bonding companies are denying or restricting coverage to an increasing number of contractors 
companies that have been successful in renewing or obtaining coverage have sometimes been required to post additional collateral to secure the same amount of bonds which reduces availability under our credit facility 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future  we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds which would reduce availability under our credit facility 
we reported net losses for the past six years 
if we continue to incur net losses  our overall level of bonding capacity could be reduced 

table of contents we have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state department of transportation related projects and assets that were sold in february in connection with the sale of our state department of transportation related projects and assets and the related settlement explained in item business recent developments  we agreed to keep certain liabilities  mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds  certain obligations under leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters 
we may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of any third party claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in the revised amended agreement  including  in the event the buyer were financially unable to meet certain obligations  any losses resulting from creditor claims 
under the terms of the revised amended agreement  the buyer is no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our favor in february to cover any remaining exposure related to our bonded obligations 
instead  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the buyer entered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection with our bonded obligations 
therefore  if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations  the surety bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity agreement 
if the surety bonding company  however  pays the amounts due under the bonds  the surety bonding company will seek reimbursement of such payment from us 
accordingly  we may incur losses in the future related to these contingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in the revised amended agreement 
at december   we estimate that the cost to complete on the million in performance and payment bonds related to these projects and assets was million 
we may incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities which could harm our profitability 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value 
in the year ended december   we charged million  against goodwill related to the decision to sell substantially all of our state department of transportation related projects and assets 
in connection with our decision to sell substantially all our canadian net assets  we wrote off goodwill associated with this entity in the amount of million for the year ended december  we may incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in any of our reporting entities in the future if the markets they serve or their business deteriorates 
we may incur restructuring charges which could reduce our profitability 
from time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
we could incur charges in the future as a result of eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy  reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate revenue or margin  reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements  and reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 
all charges related to restructuring would be reflected as operating expenses and could reduce our profitability 

table of contents our revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
at december   we had million in senior subordinated notes outstanding due february under an indenture 
since then we have issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  under a new indenture  the proceeds of which we used to redeem the senior subordinated notes due february we also have a million revolving credit facility of which we had no outstanding cash draws at december  at december   the net availability under the credit facility was approximately million which includes outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  paying cash dividends  creating certain liens against our assets  prepaying our other indebtedness  excluding the senior notes  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and indenture 
our credit facility provides that if our net borrowing base availability falls below million we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
in the past  we have not been in compliance with certain financial covenants of our credit facility and have had to seek amendments or waivers from our lenders 
should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business 
a default could result in the acceleration of either our obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior notes  or both 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent we need additional financing  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms  which may decrease our profitability and liquidity 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently which could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our business is labor intensive  and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
at times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve  it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills  we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses 
additionally  our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management 
labor shortages  increased labor or training costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced revenue  profitability and liquidity 
increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins 
the price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing 
accordingly  any increase in fuel costs could reduce our profitability and liquidity 
we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying  us for the related services 
we use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
in some cases  we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services 
if we choose  or are required  to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay  or delay paying us for the related work  we could experience a decrease in profitability and liquidity 

table of contents our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we are currently engaged in litigation related to environmental liabilities in coos bay  oregon 
see item legal proceedings 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our profitability and liquidity 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occupational safety and health act of  as amended  or osha  establishes certain employer responsibilities  including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury  compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various record keeping  disclosure and procedural requirements 
various standards  including standards for notices of hazards  safety in excavation and demolition work  may apply to our operations 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations 
we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we cannot successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our customers could be damaged which could lead to a reduction of our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our financial results are based  in part  upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued self insured claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangibles  and accounting for performance based stock awards  income taxes including net deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition 
construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines  pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials  heavy equipment  mechanical failures and adverse weather conditions 
if serious accidents or fatalities occur  we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and certain existing contracts could be terminated 
in addition  if our safety record were to deteriorate  our ability to bid on certain work could suffer 
the occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers  which could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 

table of contents many of our communications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services 
many of our communications customers are regulated by the federal communications commission  or the fcc 
the fcc may interpret the application of its regulations to communication companies in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our communications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced 
claims  lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business  including those described in item legal proceeding 
claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs 
when appropriate  we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments 
if our reserves are inadequate  or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity 
an adverse determination on any such claim  lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
see item legal proceedings 
acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
we have made  and in the future plan to make  strategic acquisitions 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of our lenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions 
we may pay for acquisitions with our common stock which may dilute your investment in our common stock or decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with 
in addition  acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  diversion of management s attention  and the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
a failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with or resulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms 
we may incur significant costs as a result of our lawsuit with our excess insurance carrier 
in the second quarter of  several complaints for a purported securities class action were filed against us and certain of our officers 
we have settled these actions without payments to the plaintiffs by us 
as part of the settlement  our excess insurance carrier has retained its rights to seek up to million in reimbursement from us based on its claim that notice was not properly given under the policy 
we may be unable to successfully resolve this dispute without incurring significant expense

table of contents risks related to our company and our common stock the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
from to  for example  our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share in the first quarter of to a low of per share in the first quarter of during and  our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
see item market information for the registrant s common equity  related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock  including announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  future sales of our common stock or other securities  announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our competitors  market conditions for providers of services to communications companies  utilities and government  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock 
a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  jose mas  our ceo  and other members of the mas family who are employed by mastec  beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of february  accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock 
our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the florida business corporation act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including by the grant of voting control to others  which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control

in part  this decision was driven by a desire to reduce the high levels of legal expense and related costs that we have incurred in recent years  and to reduce the amount of management s time devoted to litigation matters and other claims and disputes 
while we will attempt to accelerate the closure of these matters  we will only do so if we believe such resolution is in the best interests of mastec and its shareholders 
legacy litigation mastec is subject to significant outstanding litigation  primarily dating from the period through in  former employees filed a fair labor standards act flsa collective action against mastec in the federal district court in tampa  florida  alleging failure to pay overtime wages as required under the flsa 
while mastec denies the allegations underlying the lawsuit  in october we agreed to a settlement to avoid significant legal fees  the uncertainty of a jury trial  other expenses and management time that would have to be devoted to protracted litigation

in april  coos county announced it was terminating the contract and seeking another company to complete the project 
coos county subsequently counterclaimed against us in the federal district court action seeking damages in excess of million for breach of contract for alleged failures to properly construct the pipeline and for alleged environmental and labor law violations  and other causes 
the amount of revenue recognized on the coos county project that remained uncollected in accounts receivable on the december  balance sheet amounted to million representing amounts due to us on normal progress payment invoices submitted under the contract 
in february  we entered into a tentative agreement to settle our dispute with coos county  which provides for a million payment to coos county in june  and a million payment to coos county on june  with interest accruing beginning june  the tentative agreement is subject to the negotiation and approval of a definitive settlement agreement and mastec not being penalized greater than million in the corps of engineers case described below

in november  mastec entered into  and bonded  a conditional million settlement of litigation brought for subcontract work done in by hugh o kane electric for mastec on a telecommunication project for telergy in new york 
telergy is in bankruptcy and did not pay mastec for this work 
the settlement was conditioned upon the resolution of all of the court proceedings including appeals 
mastec filed an appeal seeking to enforce contractual terms which relieved mastec of its obligation to pay hugh o kane when mastec was not paid by telergy 
new york s appellate level court upheld the enforceability of the terms of mastec s contract  but remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether there were factual issues that prevented mastec from using the contractual provision as a defense 
the trial court found that factual issues prevented mastec from using the contractual provision as a defense and mastec appealed 
the appellate court upheld the trial courts ruling and mastec requested a rehearing  which was denied 
similar litigation was filed against mastec by other subcontractors performing work in on the telergy project 
in a related matter  mastec filed suit against con edison in may  alleging that con edison directly interfered with mastec s work for telergy  and that this interference resulted in the bankruptcy of telergy and resulted in con edison obtaining mastec s work on the telergy project without paying for it

we are also seeking reimbursement of expenses incurred by us which we believe are reimbursable by our excess insurance carrier 
we believe the claims of the excess insurance carrier are without merit and plan to continue vigorously pursuing this action 
although a district court ruled in march that there is no coverage provided under the excess policy  we disagree and have appealed 
we are also pursuing claims against the insurance broker for any losses arising from the same issue involving notice

mastec sued inepar for breach of contract arising out of inepar s failure to indemnify mastec for claims resulting from numerous misrepresentations made by inepar 
inepar subsequently failed to answer mastec s complaint and mastec sought a default judgment 
in september  the state court entered a judgment in favor of mastec and against inepar in the amount of million 
mastec has commenced collections efforts 
due to the uncertainty of the ongoing collection process  we have accounted for the amounts related to this judgment in our favor as a gain contingency and have not reflected these amounts in our financial statements 
in december  we brought an action against nextiraone federal in the federal court in eastern district of virginia  to recover payment for services rendered in connection with a federal department of defense project on a network wiring contract 
our network services are now a discontinued operation 
nextiraone counterclaimed for offsets and remediation 
on may   the court ruled that we failed to establish an entitlement to recover damages for contract work done  and that nextiraone federal failed to establish an entitlement to recover costs of alleged offsets and costs of remediation 
we appealed  but the appellate court affirmed the lower court s ruling 
other litigation  claims and disputes 
in addition to the matters discussed above  we are also subject to a variety of legal cases  claims and other disputes that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
financial statement impact 
primarily as a result of the change in strategy noted above  we entered into settlement negotiations on several of these legal cases  claims and other disputes  including disputes involving amounts due us  reached settlement on the flsa matter discussed above and on other disputes  and authorized settlement on a number of other matters  including certain accounts receivable for which we had been pursuing collection via negotiation or via the legal process 
as a result of these negotiations and actual or anticipated settlements including flsa and coos county  and other developments  we recorded charges totaling million for the actual or anticipated settlement of litigation  claims and other disputes in the nine months ended september  and million in the three months ended december  accrued aggregate liabilities related to the matters discussed above amounted to approximately million at december  which is included in other current liabilities 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and other asset valuation accounts related to the matters discussed above amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  although we believe that we have gone through a thorough review of these legacy and other matters and have developed what we believe are reasonable estimates for settling the legacy legal cases  claims and other disputes  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future as facts and circumstances change 
we have incurred substantial costs in connection with these claims and will continue to do so until there is a resolution of these matters 
we cannot assure you that a favorable outcome will be reached in any of these cases 
if we are not able to settle these cases at the amounts estimated  or if we are subject to an unfavorable trial outcome or other final resolution on these matters  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable
