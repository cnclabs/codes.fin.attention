item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to acquiring symphony health services  llc in  we operated in the following three business segments  which were managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services  hospitals and healthcare management consulting 
program management services include hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs which focus primarily on rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities 
on july   we acquired symphony  which was a leading provider of contract therapy program management services 
symphony also operated a therapist and nurse staffing business and a healthcare management consulting business 
with the acquisition of symphony  we created a new segment other healthcare services  which includes our preexisting healthcare management consulting business together with symphony s staffing and consulting businesses 
year ended december  in thousands revenues program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total hospitals other healthcare services less intercompany revenues total operating earnings loss program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total hospitals other healthcare services unallocated asset impairment charge unallocated corporate expenses restructuring total intercompany revenues represent sales of services  at market rates  between our operating divisions 
the operating earnings of hospital rehabilitation services include a million impairment loss on certain separately identifiable intangible assets 
the operating earnings of hospitals include a million impairment loss on a separately identifiable intangible asset

represents an impairment charge associated with the abandonment of internally developed software that was never placed in service 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
represents certain expenses associated with our starmed staffing business  which was sold on february  sources of revenue in our program management segment  we derive the majority of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payers 
a portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities 
in our hospitals segment  we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for patient care services  which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or third party managed care programs 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to operating revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  operating revenues cost and expenses operating selling  general and administrative divisions corporate impairment of assets depreciation and amortization operating earnings interest income interest expense earnings before income taxes  equity in net income loss of affiliates and minority interests income taxes equity in net income loss of affiliates minority interests net earnings loss twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues change dollars in thousands contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services hospitals other healthcare services less intercompany revenues consolidated revenues consolidated operating revenues increased from to primarily due to the acquisition of symphony on july  and the addition of three new hospitals during and one new rehabilitation hospital in the various symphony businesses and the four added hospitals generated incremental revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  in contract therapy 
contract therapy revenues increased million from million in to million in this revenue growth reflects the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business  which contributed incremental revenues of million in legacy contract therapy revenues increased by million primarily due to a increase in same store revenues and a increase in average revenue per minute of service  which more than offset a reduction in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations operated during the year over year same store revenue growth of was an improvement over the same store growth rate achieved in same store revenue growth in was negatively affected by the part b therapy caps that went into place on january  and had a significant impact on part b revenues in the first half of hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
hospital rehabilitation services operating revenues declined in as inpatient revenue declined and outpatient revenue declined 
the decline in inpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of units operated in same store acute rehabilitation revenues and discharges were down and  respectively  compared to the rule continued to impact our unit level census and the number of discharges in as patients with diagnoses outside of the qualifying diagnoses were treated at other patient care settings 
the rule is not expected to have the same negative impact in as the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act was signed into law in december and it freezes  at  the proportion of patients that must fall into the qualifying diagnoses 
the average rule compliance level for our inpatient business was in the fourth quarter of the decline in outpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of units operated  partially offset by a increase in outpatient same store revenues 
hospitals 
hospitals segment revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in revenues in reflects the mid acquisitions of louisiana specialty hospital and memorial rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas  the october opening of a rehabilitation hospital in amarillo  texas and the august opening of a majority owned rehabilitation hospital in austin  texas 
the increase in revenues also reflects year over year same store revenue growth of million or 
approximately million of this revenue growth is attributable to favorable adjustments to net liabilities for prior year medicare and medicaid cost reports assumed in the acquisition of the four meadowbrook hospitals 
other healthcare services 
other healthcare services segment revenues were million in compared to million in this revenue change is primarily due to the july  acquisition of symphony s therapist and nurse staffing business and skilled nursing consulting business 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues in due to the overall shift in revenue mix toward our contract therapy and hospital businesses  which tend to have lower operating margins than our hospital rehabilitation services business 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was partially mitigated by a million decrease in professional liability expense and a million decrease in workers compensation expense in these decreases  which primarily affect our operating divisions that provide patient care  reflect a favorable change in the company s actuarial estimates of ultimate expected losses on both claims incurred and reported and claims incurred but not reported 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects greater leveraging of these expenses with the july  acquisition of symphony and cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley  maryland at the end of june the hospitals segment incurred a million impairment charge in as discussed in more detail below 
depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of symphony 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses 
on a consolidated basis  the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributable to incremental bad debt expense for the symphony businesses 
of the million year over year increase  million is attributable to incremental provisions for doubtful accounts for the rehabworks contract therapy business which was acquired in the symphony transaction on july  during  the provision for doubtful accounts attributable to the rehabworks business was a greater percentage of revenue than the historical levels for our legacy contract therapy business 
we concluded that an incremental provision for doubtful accounts for rehabworks receivables was warranted in primarily based on our assessment of the collection risk of several larger clients where we terminated services and our assessment of the overall risk in the portfolio of rehabworks receivables

total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business 
contract therapy s direct operating expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased from in to in mainly as a result of productivity improvements achieved in both the legacy contract therapy and the rehabworks businesses 
driving the large productivity improvements in the rehabworks business was the completion of the conversion of all rehabworks sites to the same systems and processes that are in place in the legacy contract therapy business 
the division s productivity improvements helped offset the effect of an increase in the division s provision for doubtful accounts  as previously discussed  and an increase in employee incentive costs  which was largely due to the conversion of all rehabworks employees to rehabcare s incentive plan on january  division and corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of unit revenue reflecting the cost benefit of the synergies achieved in the integration of the symphony business as well as cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley at the end of june depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the july  acquisition of symphony 
contract therapy s operating earnings were million in compared to a loss of million in hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
total hospital rehabilitation services costs and expenses declined from to primarily due to declines in both direct operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
direct operating expenses declined as average units in operation fell 
the division s direct operating expenses as a percentage of unit revenue increased slightly from in to in as an increase in bad debt expense and a decline in therapist productivity  particularly in our outpatient business  was largely offset by a decrease in professional liability and workers compensation expense 
fiscal year bad debt expense in this division was lower than historical levels primary due to several recoveries of accounts previously turned over to attorneys for collection 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to reflecting efforts to control costs and a greater leveraging of these expenses across the company with the acquisition of symphony 
total hospital rehabilitation services operating earnings were million in compared to million in hospitals 
total hospital costs and expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in primarily due to the recognition of an impairment loss on an intangible asset 
the segment recognized an impairment loss of million in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  note to the consolidated financial statements contains additional background information regarding the impairment loss 
the division incurred start up costs of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the start up costs in relate primarily to our majority owned austin  texas joint venture 
division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of unit revenue increased from the prior year reflecting efforts to grow this segment  the reallocation of certain resources from our other divisions and an investment in back office resources to support the growth in the division expected in depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of louisiana specialty hospital and memorial rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas and the depreciation of leasehold improvements in our rehabilitation hospitals in amarillo  texas and austin  texas 
as a result of these factors  the hospitals segment generated an operating loss of million in compared to operating earnings of million in other healthcare services 
operating earnings for the other healthcare services segment increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to the improved operating performance of our phase consulting  inc phase business 
non operating items interest income increased from million in to million in primarily due to the recognition of million of interest income in related to a federal income tax refund claim  which was partially offset by a decline in interest income earned on average cash and investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in borrowings against our revolving credit facility which occurred in connection with funding of the mid acquisitions of symphony and memorial rehabilitation hospital midland 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was million 
interest expense also includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for various acquisitions completed over the last three years  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the remaining aggregate principal balance on all subordinated promissory notes was million 
earnings before income taxes  equity in net income loss of affiliates and minority interests increased from million in to million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in is principally the result of lower taxable income generated in certain high tax rate states  state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of accruals for certain state tax exposures that were favorably resolved during the year or because the related statute of limitations lapsed 
equity in net income loss of affiliates was million in and million in during the first quarter of  we elected to abandon our equity interest in intelistaf holdings and therefore wrote off the remaining million carrying value of our investment in that entity 
the remainder of the year over year variance is the result of improved operating performance by our owned rehabilitation hospital in kokomo  indiana 
net earnings were million in compared to million in diluted earnings per share were in compared to in twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues change dollars in thousands contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services hospitals other healthcare services less intercompany revenues consolidated revenues consolidated operating revenues increased from to primarily due to revenues generated by symphony  which we acquired on july   and the hospitals segment  which was formed with the acquisition of meadowbrook on august  the various symphony businesses generated revenues of million in the six months following the acquisition 
revenues for the freestanding hospitals segment increased million from million in to million in revenues for hospital rehabilitation services decreased million in contract therapy 
contract therapy revenues increased million from million in to million in the majority of this revenue growth was due to the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business  which contributed revenues of million in the six months following the acquisition 
we operated in rehabworks locations at december  the remaining revenue increase of million is primarily due to an increase in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations operated from in to in and a increase in the average revenue per minute of service in the legacy contract therapy locations 
same store revenues grew in which is down from the same store growth rate achieved in the prior year 
the decline in the rate of same store revenue growth is primarily due to the impact of part b therapy caps instituted on january   which had a significant impact on part b revenues throughout the first half of for the year  medicare part b revenues decreased million or for our legacy contract therapy business 
in addition  same store growth for was positively impacted by the phase in of the first stages of the rule  which caused certain patients to seek services in a skilled nursing setting rather than in an inpatient rehabilitation setting 
hospital rehabilitation services 
hospital rehabilitation services operating revenues for declined by million  or 
a small increase in revenue from the outpatient business only partially offset a decline in inpatient revenues 
in the outpatient business  same store revenues grew  due to a increase in same store units of service and a increase in net revenue per unit of service 
the decline in inpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of operating units from in to in and pricing pressure experienced on certain contract renewals 
the decline in average operating units was primarily in the subacute business 
the inpatient business was further impacted by a decline in acute rehabilitation same store revenues which was primarily due to a decline in same store discharges 
the rule continued to impact our unit level census and caused a reduction in the number of discharges for as a number of patients with diagnoses outside of the qualifying diagnoses were treated at other patient care settings 
hospitals 
hospitals segment revenues were million in compared to million in this division was formed with the acquisition of the assets of meadowbrook which was completed on august   therefore  only five months of meadowbrook s operating revenues were included in our financial statements for the four meadowbrook hospitals generated revenues of million in the remaining million of revenue in reflects the acquisitions of louisiana specialty hospital in june and memorial rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas in july and the openings of new rehabilitation hospitals in arlington  texas in december and amarillo  texas in october other healthcare services 
other healthcare services segment revenues were million in compared to million in a small decrease in revenue from our phase consulting business was more than offset by the revenues generated by symphony s therapist and nurse staffing and skilled nursing consulting services businesses  which were acquired on july  cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses in  certain expenses associated with the indemnification of pre sale liabilities related to our former starmed staffing business  in excess of the amount accrued upon the sale of the business on february   have not been allocated against our current business segments operating profits 
see the following table for detail of costs and expenses by business segment 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to increased operating costs in contract therapy and hospital rehabilitation services  as discussed in more detail below  and due to the overall shift in revenue mix toward our contract therapy and hospital businesses  which tend to have lower operating margins than our hospital rehabilitation services business 
the decrease in division selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues reflects the additional revenues from our hospital business which required less investment in division level selling and administrative personnel than our other divisions  lower division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the symphony businesses and stable division selling  general and administrative costs in our other businesses 
while corporate selling  general and administrative expense remained flat as a percentage of sales  expense dollars increased primarily as a result of the july  acquisition of symphony  higher legal expenses primarily for defense costs in two matters that have been favorably resolved and the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses include million of costs related to symphony s corporate office in baltimore  maryland and approximately million of incremental expenses added to our corporate offices in st 
louis to support the symphony businesses 
the majority of the million of costs relates to salaries and benefits for back office employees of the symphony businesses we acquired on july  between july and december   we reduced the net headcount for symphony s back office by employees

total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with symphony s rehabworks business  which was acquired on july  rehabworks accounts for the vast majority of the million increase in the division s direct operating expenses 
in addition  direct operating expenses for the legacy contract therapy locations increased in reflecting an increase in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations and an increase in the total labor and benefit cost per minute of therapy service 
this increase was attributable to higher wage costs  greater use of higher cost contract labor and lower therapist productivity partially attributable to the negative impact of the part b therapy caps during the first half of additionally  labor and benefit cost per minute of service was higher in the rehabworks locations when compared to the legacy contract therapy locations 
contract therapy s corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of overhead costs incurred for symphony s corporate office in baltimore 
in addition  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses for included allocated stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of symphony 
as a result of these factors  operating earnings for contract therapy decreased from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services 
total hospital rehabilitation services hrs costs and expenses declined from to primarily due to a decline in direct operating expenses and the impact of an impairment charge in direct operating expenses declined as average units in operation fell from to hrs s direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of higher labor and benefit costs resulting from continued wage pressure for therapists and pricing pressure experienced on certain contract renewals 
inpatient revenue per discharge increased while labor and benefit costs per discharge  including contract labor  increased compared to these cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in division bad debt expense resulting primarily from several recoveries of accounts previously turned over to attorneys for collection 
division level selling  general  and administrative expenses have declined  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  reflecting efforts to control costs and consolidate certain management functions with our contract therapy division 
these efforts were partially offset by an increased investment in program marketing directed at identifying more rule qualifying patients and improving overall patient census 
these efforts enabled us to mitigate the negative impact of the rule better than the industry as a whole 
measured on a same store basis  we experienced a year over year decline in acute rehabilitation discharges 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in reflecting efforts to control costs and greater leveraging of these expenses with the acquisition of symphony 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined the vitalcare trade name and contractual customer relationship intangible assets were impaired and wrote down the value of those assets by million 
hrs s depreciation and amortization expense declined from to primarily due to lower amortization associated with vitalcare s intangible assets 
the net effect of the revenue decline  lower operating margins  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  the prior year impairment charge and reduced depreciation and amortization expense in was a million increase in hrs operating earnings from million in to million in hospitals 
the hospitals segment  which was formed in the third quarter of with the acquisition of meadowbrook  generated operating earnings of million in compared to an operating loss of million in during  our hospitals segment incurred total start up costs of approximately million for our arlington  texas rehabilitation hospital  which admitted its first patient in late december  our amarillo  texas facility  which admitted its first patient in october  and our midland  texas rehabilitation hospital  which was acquired on july  but did not receive its medicare and state certifications until early august 
we define start up costs as net operating losses incurred prior to approval of medicare licensure 
the segment s operating loss for was primarily due to the impact of lower than expected patient census and start up costs for our arlington  texas and amarillo  texas facilities 
other healthcare services 
operating earnings for the other healthcare services segment were million in compared to an operating loss of million in this improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of symphony s therapist staffing business on july  non operating items interest income decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in borrowings against our revolving credit facility which occurred in connection with funding of the mid acquisitions of symphony and midland 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was million 
we had no balance outstanding as of december  interest expense also includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for various acquisitions completed over the last three years  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the remaining aggregate principal balance on all subordinated promissory notes was approximately million 
earnings before income taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates and minority interests declined to million in from million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the decline in the effective tax rate in is principally the result of lower taxable income generated in certain high tax rate states  state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of accruals for certain state tax exposures that were favorably resolved during the year or because the related statute of limitations lapsed 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of the losses of less than majority owned equity investments  primarily our investment in intelistaf holdings 
during the first quarter of  we elected to abandon our interest in intelistaf and therefore wrote off the remaining carrying value of our investment in intelistaf of million 
this decision was made for a variety of business reasons including intelistaf s continuing poor operating performance  the disproportionate percentage of our management time and effort that was being devoted to this non core business  and an expected income tax benefit to be derived from the abandonment 
equity in net loss of affiliates for includes an overall loss of million related to our investment in intelistaf 
during  our share of intelistaf losses was million 
equity in net loss of affiliates for also included a million write down in the carrying value of our investment in intelistaf to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
diluted earnings loss per share was in compared to in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and a current ratio  the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital decreased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  net accounts receivable were million at december   compared to million at december  the number of days sales outstanding dso in net receivables was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in dso in compared to was primarily due to the increased age of contract therapy receivables coupled with the greater proportionate mix of contract therapy receivables  including balances added via the july  acquisition of symphony  which tend to have a longer collection cycle than the company s other receivable balances 
we believe the increase in dso for contract therapy receivables at december  was principally the result of a temporary shift in focus from collection activities to activities associated with the integration of symphony corporate back office functions  including credit and collections  which resulted in some deterioration in both our legacy and rehabworks contract therapy dso 
as expected  contract therapy dso improved in  however  we expect the company s overall dso to remain higher than historical levels as a result of the greater mix of contract therapy receivables in our overall receivable portfolio 
for the year ended december   we generated cash from operations of million  which included a million tax refund received from the irs during the third quarter 
cash from operations of million for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable 
delays in receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursements and a temporary shift in focus from collection activities to symphony integration activities contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in information technology systems  the construction of new hospitals  equipment additions and replacements and various other capital improvements 
over the next few years  we plan to continue to invest significantly in information technology systems and the development and renovation of our hospitals 
the company has historically financed its operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments 
we believe our cash on hand  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion and debt service requirements 
we have a million  five year revolving credit facility  dated june   with million outstanding as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the revolving credit facility is expandable to million  subject to the approval of the lending group and subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants  the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately million 
as part of the purchases of louisiana specialty hospital on june  and the meadowbrook business in  we issued long term subordinated promissory notes to the respective selling parties 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from 
as of december   million of these notes remained outstanding  all of which is payable during inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts typically provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt fin liability other long term liabilities total we lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
approximately million of the amounts included on this line represent commitments related to the construction of a rehabilitation hospital in chesterfield  missouri and leasehold improvements for an ltach in kokomo  indiana 
for the purpose of computing the interest payments shown here  we have assumed a constant balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility of million through june   which is the date on which our credit facility expires 
this also assumes our contracts under the revolving credit facility are renewed at the currently existing rates of interest 
this represents our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our fin liabilities  which involve various taxing authorities 
as a result  we are unable to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in designated investments and remain our property until distribution 
because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating contractual allowances  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
contractual allowances 
our hospitals recognize net patient revenue in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances using the balance sheet approach on an individual hospital basis 
patient accounts receivable detail is analyzed to determine expected reimbursement for each patient 
expected reimbursement is summarized by payer classification and reconciled to the balance sheet 
a secondary review is completed at the consolidated hospitals level to validate calculations 
estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration medicare reimbursement rules and known changes to contract terms  laws and regulations and payment history 
if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
the estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined 
in  our hospitals recorded favorable net settlements of prior year medicare and medicaid cost reports aggregating million 
we did not record any significant adjustments for prior year cost reports in or we are not aware of any material claims  disputes  or unsettled matters with third party payers 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  we also determined that this intangible asset no longer had an indefinite life  and in  began amortizing it on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s remaining estimated useful life 
in  no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was identified  however  in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of the trade name we acquired in the march  acquisition of the common stock of american vitalcare  inc and its sister company  managed alternative care  inc collectively vitalcare 
as required by statement no 
 we also conducted an annual impairment assessment of goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy  hospitals and other healthcare services businesses and determined that the related goodwill was not impaired 
the test required comparison of the estimated fair value of these businesses to our book value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our contract therapy  hospital rehabilitation services  hospitals and other healthcare services businesses was million  million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
under statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an asset group should be tested for recoverability and possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
primarily due to a loss of customer contracts at a rate more rapid than expected  the assets of vitalcare generated operating losses in and our projections demonstrated potential continuing losses associated with this asset group 
as a result  we determined that the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group at december  was not recoverable because it exceeded the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million on contractual customer relationships  which is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group exceeded its fair value 
statement no

in  we decided to abandon an internal software development project we began in we had intended for this software application to be the building block of an integrated platform to support our strategy of clinically integrated post acute continuums of care 
because of cost overruns  this project was put on hold in with the intention of restarting the project at a later date 
following the hiring of a new chief information officer in the fourth quarter of  we completed a review of our information technology applications and concluded that this project would not meet the needs of the business and any additional costs necessary to make the application functional would be in excess of the anticipated benefit to be derived

health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

during  intelistaf incurred significant operating losses even though the healthcare staffing industry as a whole showed signs of recovery 
the company reviewed its investment in intelistaf for impairment in accordance with requirements of apb opinion no 
based on this review  the company concluded that an other than temporary decline in the value of the company s investment had occurred in the fourth quarter of this impairment combined with the company s share of intelistaf s operating losses reduced the carrying value of the company s investment in intelistaf to million at december  on march   we elected to abandon our interest in intelistaf 
this decision was made for a variety of business reasons including intelistaf s continuing poor operating performance  intelistaf s liquidity problems  the disproportionate share of rehabcare management time and effort that has been devoted to this non core business and an expected income tax benefit to be derived from the abandonment
