item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under item a 
risk factors  beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing hpc systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
our supercomputer systems provide capability  capacity and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific and engineering computing problems 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the hpc market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect and system capabilities that enable our supercomputers to scale that is  to continue to increase performance as they grow in size 
in addition  we have demonstrated expertise in the four primary processor technologies 
purpose built for the supercomputer market  our systems balance highly capable processors  highly scalable system software and very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities 
in  our senior management team changed significantly with a new chief executive officer and new leaders in technology  finance  marketing  operations and customer support 
since then we have continued to add depth in the management team  particularly in engineering  sales  marketing and finance  and have continued our focus on our announced goals of obtaining market leadership in the hpc markets that we target and having sustained annual profitability 
in early we announced our adaptive supercomputing vision to expand the concept of hybrid computing to a fully integrated view of supporting multiple processing technologies within a single  highly scalable system 
our november million award from darpa under its hpcs program will co fund our cascade development project to implement this vision 
in and  we obtained significant market penetration internationally  particularly in europe 
in  we introduced the cray xt family of products  a significant step toward realizing our adaptive supercomputing vision  and made progress on our financial goals with significantly improved product gross margins and a stronger balance sheet 

table of contents summary of results revenue decreased by million  or  in from  with million coming from decreases in product revenue and the remaining million coming from decreases in service revenue 
the decrease in product revenue was principally due to delays in completing new products in time to recognize revenue in because of delays in product development and component availability  and anticipated lower project revenue largely due to the completion of the darpa phase ii contract in loss from operations increased in to a loss of million compared to a loss from operations of million in gross margin contribution increased million despite lower revenue  with a million increase in product gross margin contribution offset in part by a decrease in service gross margin contribution 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring  severance and impairment expense  increased million principally due to higher net research and development expense  which more than offset lower general and administrative expense 
net cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in cash and short term investment balances  including restricted cash balances  increased by million during we did not borrow under our line of credit during the year 
market overview and challenges in recent years the most significant trend in the hpc market has been the continuing expansion and acceptance of low bandwidth cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd  ibm and others with commercially available commodity networking and other components throughout the hpc market  especially in capacity computing situations 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements  even at times in capability market procurements 
in the capability market and in large capacity procurements in the enterprise market  the use of commodity processors and networking components is resulting in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance faster processor speeds with network communication capability 
with the arrival of dual and quad core processors  these unbalanced systems have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications  a trend that is likely to increase with the arrival of ever larger multi core processors in future years 
in response  vendors have begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types in order to solve complex problems faster 
in addition  with increasing numbers of multi core processors  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the market s demanding needs  as we concentrate our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect  system software and packaging capabilities that enable our supercomputers to scale that is  to continue to increase performance as  purpose built for the supercomputer market  they grow in size 
we have demonstrated expertise in the four primary processor technologies vector processing  massively parallel processing  multithreading and co processing with field programmable gate arrays 
our experience and capabilities across each of these fronts are becoming ever more important  especially in larger procurements 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger multi core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems 
nevertheless  to compete against cluster systems in the longer term  we need to incorporate greater performance differentiation across our products 
we believe we will have such differentiation through our vector based technology incorporated in our cray xth system and our multithreaded cray xmt system 
these products  which focus on narrower markets than our commodity processor products  are expected to be available in we must add greater performance differentiation to our high bandwidth  massively parallel commodity processor based products  such as our cray xt  cray xt and successor systems 
while increasing performance differentiation  we must balance the business strategy trade offs between using commodity parts  which are available to our competitors  and proprietary components  which are both expensive and time consuming to develop but provide customers with higher levels of performance and capability 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
revenue growth is the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the markets we address 
the introduction of the quad core cray xt system and the cray xt family and our longer term product roadmap are efforts to increase product revenue 
we also plan to increase our cray technical services offerings to increase revenue 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short run and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross margins 
our total gross margin and our product gross margin for was and  respectively  a significant increase from the respective levels of and 
we need to continue to maintain and improve our product gross margins  which we believe is best achieved through increased product differentiation 
we also monitor service margins and have been proactive in reducing service costs where possible 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  contracted research and development services and the level of recognized co funded research and development 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
during we received increased levels of co funding for our research and development projects 
our november darpa phase iii award is in line with our long term development path 
this award  however  likely will result in potentially large increases in gross and net research and development expenditures by us in future periods due to the size of the overall program and the cost sharing requirement on our part 
our operating expenses for were approximately million greater than  with higher net research and development expenses in due to lower amounts recognized from government co funding arrangements and increased headcount offset in part by lower general and administrative and restructuring and severance expenses 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue  our cash position also varies from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of potential increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
sustained profitability over annual periods is our primary objective  which should improve our cash position and shareholder value 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  accounting for loss contracts  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 
additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the fair value determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting on the red storm contract  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts  determination of inventory at the lower 
table of contents of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and assessments of fair value  estimation of restructuring costs  calculation of deferred income tax assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to our customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no significant unfulfilled obligations exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue in our consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are our statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the element could be sold separately  the fair value of the undelivered element is established  and in cases with any general right of return  our performance with respect to any undelivered element is within our control and probable 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element as the elements would not be considered a separate unit of accounting and revenue would be recognized as described below under our product or service revenue recognition policies 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the sales price as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
products 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon customer acceptance of the system  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract that affect the customer s final acceptance  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is typically required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
darpa phase ii and red storm project revenue 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex information technology systems to a customer s specifications is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components or services 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and margins on a cumulative basis 
to the extent the estimate of total costs to complete the contract indicates a loss  such amount is recognized in full in the period that the determination is made 
revenue from these arrangements was included in product revenue on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations for  and funding under darpa phase iii  
table of contents however  was reflected as reimbursed research and development expense  and as such was deducted to arrive at net research and development expenses as recorded on our consolidated statements of operations for services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of fair value 
revenue for the maintenance of computers is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we consider fiscal funding clauses as contingencies for the recognition of revenue until the funding is virtually assured 
revenue from cray technical services is recognized as the services are rendered 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand of our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december  consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the cray research business unit assets from sgi in and our acquisition of octigabay in we no longer amortize goodwill associated with these acquisitions  but we are required to conduct periodic analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
we currently have one operating segment and reporting unit 
as such  we evaluate any potential goodwill impairment by comparing our net assets against the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
we performed an annual impairment test effective january   and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
the analysis of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired and the number and nature of our reporting units involves a substantial amount of judgment 
future charges related to the amounts recorded for goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
in connection with our acquisition of octigabay  we assigned million of value to core technology 
in december we announced plans to further integrate our technology platforms  and combine the cray xd and the cray xt products into a unified product offering 
we determined that the core technology asset was impaired and recorded a charge of million charge in to restructuring  severance and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with this charge  we reversed the remaining deferred tax liability of million that was established in the purchase accounting as amortization of this intangible asset was not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated in foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets through future operations 
on january   we implemented the provisions of fas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense  respectively 
such amounts were not material for  and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position 
accounting for loss contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  certain production contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion accounting method 
we recognize revenue based on a measurement of completion comparing the ratio of costs incurred to date with total estimated costs multiplied by the contract value 
inherent in these estimates are uncertainties about the total cost to complete the project 
if the estimate to complete results in a loss on the contract  we will record the amount of the estimated loss in the period the determination is made 
on a regular basis  we update our estimates of total costs 
changes to the estimate may result in a charge or benefit to operations 
as of december   our estimate of loss on the red storm contract totaled million 
as of december  and  our estimate of loss on the red storm contract was a cumulative loss of million 
as of december  and  the red storm loss contract accrual balance was million and  respectively  and is included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
research and development expenses research and development costs include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing software features and expenses related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from the us government 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 
in  and  certain of these co funding payments were recognized as product revenue 
see revenue recognition darpa phase ii and red storm project revenue above 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions 
table of contents and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as such  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense  based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
estimates of fair value of stock options are based upon the black scholes option pricing model 
we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities which has been delayed until after november  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force of the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts will be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial results 
in december  the emerging issues task force of the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf provides income statement classification and related disclosure guidance for participants in a collaborative arrangement

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
fas  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fas is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued fas no

results of operations revenue and gross margins our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross margin product gross margin percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross margin service gross margin percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross margin total gross margin percentage product revenue product revenue in decreased million  or  over due to delays in component availability and product development that adversely affected our ability to deliver and recognize revenue from our quad core cray xt  cray xth and cray xmt systems that had been anticipated at the beginning of the year 
additionally  as anticipated  project revenue decreased to million in compared to project revenue of million in  largely due to the termination of the darpa phase ii project that ended in product revenue in increased million  or  over due to increased sales of cray xt systems that offset sales decreases of cray xe and cray xd systems 
revenue from the darpa phase ii and red storm development projects totaled million in compared to million in for  while a wide range of results are possible  we expect significantly improved product revenue over  weighted heavily toward the second half of the year 
our expectations are based on anticipated initial revenue from quad core cray xt and cray xth systems in the first half of and from cray xt systems later in the year 
service revenue service revenue for decreased million  or  over  as a result of decreased maintenance revenue and lower revenue from cray technical services due to the end of a refurbishment contract in service revenue for increased million  or  over  due to a growth in maintenance revenue from new contracts and revenue from cray technical services 
we target overall service revenue to increase in to near levels 
although we expect our maintenance service revenue to stabilize and grow modestly over the next year  we may have periodic revenue and margin declines as our older  higher margin service contracts end 
our newer products will likely require less hardware 
table of contents maintenance and therefore generate less maintenance revenue than our historic vector systems 
we are targeting modest growth in cray technical services revenue through new project offerings 
product gross margin product gross margin improved percentage points in compared to this improvement in product gross margin was due primarily to increased gross margins across all product lines  including lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory and lower red storm and darpa phase ii low margin project revenue 
this was partially offset by the settlement of certain contract penalties for deliveries that were delayed and or did not meet contractual performance requirements 
product gross margin improved percentage points for compared to this improvement in product gross margin was due to increased gross margins across all product lines  including lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory and no amortization of core technology intangible assets that were written off during the fourth quarter of additionally  gross margins for were negatively impacted by a million loss on the red storm project 
the red storm and darpa phases i and ii project costs  totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  are reflected on our financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded in our financial statements as product revenue 
excluding these low margin development projects  product gross margin in  and would have been  and  respectively 
revenue for  and included   and million  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
in  this amount consisted mainly of the sale of a refurbished cray te supercomputer  one of our legacy systems 
we expect our product gross margin percentage in to be similar to levels  although to fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
we expect to recognize approximately million of low margin project revenue during service gross margin despite a decrease in cost of service revenue of million in compared to  service gross margin declined percentage points in compared to due to the decreases in maintenance revenue and the end of a high margin cray technical services refurbishment contract in service gross margin improved percentage points in compared to due to the increases in maintenance and cray technical services revenue while increasing costs at a lower rate 
service gross margin percentage for is expected to decrease somewhat from levels  although gross margin contribution should increase with an increase in cray technical services revenue offset somewhat by additional costs associated with expanding our cray technical services offerings 
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the indicated years ended december were as follows in thousands  except for percentages december  gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of product revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue 
table of contents gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and darpa phases ii and iii projects 
research and development expenses on the red storm and darpa phase ii projects are reflected in our statements of operations as cost of product revenue  and government co funding on our other projects  including darpa phase iii  is recorded in our statements of operations as reimbursed research and development 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted engineering expenses 
in  gross research and development expenses decreased from levels primarily due to decreases in expenses for our cray xth systems formerly known as our blackwidow project and our cray xt  cray xd and other scalar systems  offset in part by increased expenditures on our darpa phase iii project 
we are required to spend million on our darpa phase iii project in order to receive million of co funding 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased our estimate to complete the darpa phase iii project which negatively impacted research and development expense by approximately  for the fourth quarter 
for  net research and development expenses increased as compared to due principally to decreases in government reimbursement for our cray xth system and cray xmt system  offset in part by increased co funding for our darpa phase iii project  with the aggregate decreases in government reimbursements exceeding the decrease in gross research and development expenses 
for  net research and development expenses decreased as compared to due principally to increases in reimbursement for our blackwidow  cray xmt and darpa project and reduced research and development expenses for the cray xd product line  which was offset in part by a million charge related to an intellectual property license agreement 
for  we anticipate net research and development expenses to increase about from levels  with decreases in gross research and development expenses to be more than offset by decreases in the total level of government funding 
government funding for our vector system  the cray xth system has ended 
we plan to fund further development of that system internally 
we have commenced discussions with darpa regarding the scope and timing of the darpa phase iii project 
any modification to or termination of the darpa phase iii contract could have an adverse impact on future reported research and development expense 
other operating expenses our sales and marketing  general and administrative and restructuring  severance and impairment charges for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring  severance and impairment percentage of total revenue sales and marketing 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to higher personnel costs partially offset by lower sales commissions for product sales 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and related expenses as a result of a personnel reduction that took place in  offset in part by higher commission expense on increased product revenues 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will be higher than levels primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher anticipated product sales and increased headcount  including a new senior vice president for sales and marketing 

table of contents general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative costs for compared to was primarily due to decreases in variable pay and retention compensation program expense  decreases in headcount expenses and lower costs for audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and legal fees 
the increase in general and administrative costs for over was primarily due to increases in expense for variable pay and retention compensation programs and in non cash  stock based compensation incurred in connection with restricted stock awards and stock option grants  which were partially offset by a general decrease in headcount expenses and lower costs for audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and legal fees 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be higher than expense levels due to higher expected variable incentive pay amounts 
restructuring  severance and impairment 
restructuring  severance and impairment charges include costs related to our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure by reducing headcount 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and incurred additional severance charges primarily for the retirement of our former chief executive officer  james rottsolk 
during  we incurred million of severance and other exit costs related to these actions 
during  we recognized a  favorable impact due to a change in estimate for certain benefits 
we undertook no new restructuring efforts in or in  we recorded an impairment charge of million on the unamortized balance of a core technology intangible asset acquired in connection with the octigabay acquisition 
other income expense  net for the year ended december   we recognized net other income of million due principally to foreign exchange transaction gains  including approximately  related to a foreign exchange gain on a forward foreign exchange contract prior to its designation as a cash flow hedge 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized net other expense of million and million  respectively 
net other expense for the year ended december   was principally the result of foreign exchange losses in connection with a forward foreign exchange contract  while net other expense for the year ended december  was principally foreign currency losses on the remeasurement of foreign currency balances  principally intercompany balances 
interest income expense  net our interest income and interest expense for the indicated years ended december were in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income increased in compared to as a result of higher average invested cash balances primarily as a result of the december common stock offering and higher short term interest rates 
interest income increased in compared to as a result of higher average invested cash balances and higher short term interest rates 
interest expense for  and includes million of interest on our notes 
additionally  interest expense for  and includes 
million  million and million  respectively  of non cash amortization of fees capitalized in connection with both our line of credit and our long term debt offering costs and   and  respectively  of interest and related fees on our line of credit 
for  we expect interest income and therefore overall net interest income to decrease significantly due to lower average cash balances and lower short term interest rates 

table of contents taxes we recorded income tax expense of million and  in and  respectively  which reflects tax expense for local  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  which consisted of a million benefit for foreign deferred taxes  partially offset by current tax expense for local  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
there has been no current provision for us federal income taxes for any period presented 
we have income taxes currently payable due to our operations in certain foreign countries  particularly in canada and certain european and asian countries and in certain states 
as of december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in if not utilized 
net income loss net loss was million in  million in and million in the loss included higher net research and development expense offsetting increased gross margin contribution  higher interest and other income and lower general and administrative and restructuring  severance and impairment expense 
the loss included low gross margin on product revenue recognized for our cray x xe installation at the korea meteorological administration  million in inventory write downs and a million charge for an intellectual property license agreement 
the loss included a million charge for additional estimated losses identified during on the red storm development contract and restructuring  severance and impairment charges of million  which includes a million write down for core technology impairment 
for  while there is a wide range of potential outcomes for the reasons discussed above  we target profitability for the year 
we anticipate using cash over the course of the year  very heavily in the first two quarters  as we build inventory for planned customer shipments in the second half of the year 
this use of cash combined with anticipated lower interest rates is expected to result in decreased interest income in our quarterly and annual results in will be affected by many factors  including the level and timing of government funding  the timing and success of planned product rollouts  the timing and success of meeting certain product development milestones and the timing of customer orders  shipments  acceptances  revenue recognition and margin contribution 
we expect quarterly results to fluctuate significantly

net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in net cash used in financing activities was  in for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities included million of proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities included million from our december common stock offering and million of proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of  paid for line of credit issuance costs and  for payments on capital leases  offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts  outside engineering expenses  particularly as we continue development of our cray xt  cray xt  cray xth  cray xmt and successor systems and internally fund a portion of the expenses on our cascade project pursuant to the darpa phase iii award  interest expense and acquisition of property and equipment 
our capital budget for property and equipment is approximately million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year less than contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases unrecognized income tax benefits total contractual cash obligations we have million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes due in the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  or million per year  and holders of the notes may require us to purchase the notes on december   december  and december  or upon the occurrence of certain events provided in the indenture governing the notes 
we expect that we likely will have to purchase all of the notes in december in december  we amended our line of credit reducing the maximum line of credit to million from million and extending the expiration date to june no amounts were outstanding under this line as of december  as of the same date  we were eligible to use million of this line of credit  the borrowing limitation relates to restrictions from our outstanding letters of credit 
in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
with the acceptances and payment for large new systems and the benefit from our restructuring activities and other 
table of contents recent cost reduction efforts offset by expenditures for working capital purposes  we anticipate that our cash flow from operations will likely be negative for as a whole  particularly in the first half of the year  although a wide range of results is possible 
we do not anticipate borrowing from our credit line and we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
we have been focusing on expense controls  negotiating sales contracts with advance partial payments where possible  implementing tighter purchasing and manufacturing processes and improving working capital management in order to maintain adequate levels of cash 
additionally  the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products  particularly the cray xt  cray xt  cray xth and cray xmt systems  with adequate margins 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis

risk factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we held a portfolio of highly liquid investments 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we have entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million
