item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed in october to own and operate the assets that have historically been owned and operated by cgi and hiland partners  llc 
cgi historically owned all of our natural gas gathering  processing  treating and fractionation assets other than our worland and bakken gathering systems and the kinta area gathering systems we acquired on may  hiland partners  llc historically has owned our worland gathering system  our compression services assets and the bakken gathering system 
cgi is our predecessor for accounting purposes 
as a result  our historical financial statements for periods prior to february   the date of our initial public offering  are the financial statements of cgi 
in connection with our initial public offering  the former owners of cgi and hiland partners  llc and certain of our affiliates  including our general partner  contributed to us  all of the assets and operations of cgi  other than a portion of its working capital assets  and substantially all of the assets and operations of hiland partners  llc  other than a portion of its working capital assets and the assets related to the bakken gathering system  in exchange for an aggregate of  common units and  subordinated units  a general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights  which entitle the general partner to increasing percentages of the cash we distribute in excess of per unit per quarter 
we completed our initial public offering of  common units on february   receiving net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from the public offering were used to pay remaining offering costs of million and deferred debt issuance costs of million  pay outstanding indebtedness of million  redeem million of common units from an affiliate of harold hamm and the hamm trusts  and make a million distribution to the previous owners of hiland partners  llc 
we retained million of the net proceeds to replenish working capital 
effective september   we consummated the bakken acquisition pursuant to which we acquired the outstanding membership interests in hiland partners  llc  an oklahoma limited liability company  for approximately million in cash  million of which was used to retire outstanding hiland partners  llc indebtedness 
hiland partners  llc s principal asset is the bakken gathering system located in eastern montana 
we completed a follow on offering of  common units on november   receiving net proceeds of million including our general partner s contribution of million 
we used million of the proceeds from the public offering to repay a portion of our credit facility borrowings that we had previously used to fund the bakken acquisition 
on may   we acquired the kinta area gathering assets from enogex gas gathering  llc  consisting of certain eastern oklahoma gas gathering assets  for million 
we financed this acquisition with million of borrowings from our credit facility and million of proceeds from the issuance of  common units at per unit to hiland partners gp  llc  our general partner  and from its general partner contribution 
on september   certain affiliated unitholders contributed i all of the membership interests in our general partner  which owns the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in us and ii  common units including  common units held by our general partner and  subordinated units in us to hiland holdings gp  lp  a publicly owned limited partnership nasdaq hpgp  in exchange for  limited partner units  representing a ownership in hiland holdings gp  lp 
hiland partners gp holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company formed on may   is the general partner of hiland holdings gp  lp 
we are engaged in gathering  compressing  dehydrating  treating  processing and marketing natural gas  fractionating ngls and providing air compression and water injection services for oil and gas secondary recovery operations 
our operations are primarily located in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions of the united states 
we manage our business and analyze and report our results of operations on a segment basis 
our operations are divided into two business segments midstream segment  which is engaged in gathering and processing of natural gas primarily in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions 
within this segment  we also provide certain related services for compression  dehydrating  and treating of natural gas and the fractionation of ngls 
the midstream segment generated  and of our total segment margin for the years ended december   and  respectively 
compression segment  which is engaged in providing air compression and water injection services for oil and gas secondary recovery operations that are ongoing in north dakota 
the compression segment generated  and of our total segment margin for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had no compression segment prior to february  our midstream assets consist of natural gas gathering systems with approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines  five natural gas processing plants  seven natural gas treating facilities and three ngl fractionation facilities 
our compression assets consist of two air compression facilities and a water injection plant 
our results of operations are determined primarily by five interrelated variables the volume of natural gas gathered through our pipelines  the volume of natural gas processed  the volume of ngls fractionated  the level and relationship of natural gas and ngl prices  and our current contract portfolio 
because our profitability is a function of the difference between the revenues we receive from our operations  including revenues from the products we sell  and the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of products we purchase  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
to a large extent  our contract portfolio and the pricing environment for natural gas and ngls will dictate increases or decreases in our profitability 
our profitability is also dependent upon prices and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which fluctuate with changes in market and economic condition and other factors 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our segment performance 
these measurements include the following natural gas and ngl sales volumes  throughput volumes and fuel consumption by our facilities  total segment margin  operations and maintenance expenses  general and administrative expenses  and ebitda 
volumes and fuel consumption 
natural gas and ngl sales volumes  throughput volumes and fuel consumption associated with our business are an important part of our operational analysis 
we continually monitor volumes on our pipelines to ensure that we have adequate throughput to meet our financial objectives 
it is important that we continually add new volumes to our gathering systems to offset or exceed the normal decline of existing volumes that are connected to those systems 
the performance at our processing  fractionation and treating facilities is significantly influenced by the volumes of natural gas that flows through our systems 
in addition  we monitor fuel consumption because it has an impact on the total segment margin realized from our midstream operations and our compression services operations 
total segment margin 
we view total segment margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review total segment margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
with respect to our midstream segment  we define midstream segment margin as our midstream revenue minus midstream purchases 
midstream revenue includes revenue from the sale of natural gas  ngls and ngl products resulting from our gathering  treating  processing and fractionation activities and fixed fees associated with the gathering of natural gas and the transportation and disposal of saltwater 
midstream purchases include the cost of natural gas  condensate and ngls purchased by us from third parties and the cost for the transportation and fractionation of ngls by third parties 
our midstream segment margin is impacted by our midstream contract portfolio  which is described in more detail below 
with respect to our compression segment  following the restructuring of our lease arrangement to become a service arrangement in connection with our initial public offering as described in items impacting comparability of our financial results  our compression segment margin equals the fee we earn under our compression services agreement with clr for providing air compression and water injection services 
the fee that we earn under this agreement is fixed so long as our facilities meet specified availability requirements  regardless of clr s utilization 
as a result  our compression segment margin is dependent on our ability to meet their utilization levels 
for a discussion of this agreement  please read our contracts compression services agreement 
total segment margin is a non gaap performance measure 
for a reconciliation of total segment margin to the most comparable gaap financial measure  please see item selected historical financial and operating data 
operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
direct labor  insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expenses 
these expenses remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include the cost of employee and officer compensation and related benefits  office lease and expenses  professional fees  information technology expenses  as well as other expenses not directly associated with our field operations 
our general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of our becoming a public company  combined with an increased need for corporate office employees as a result of acquisitions and internal growth 
these expenses were approximately million for  million for and million for these increases were primarily due to increased wages and benefits as a result of growth  non cash compensation expense related to option  restricted unit and phantom unit awards  acquisition evaluation costs  costs of tax return preparations  filing annual and quarterly reports with the securities and exchange commission  investor relations  directors and officers insurance and registrar and transfer agent fees 
in the omnibus agreement we entered into with clr in connection with our initial public offering on february   clr agreed to provide technology support and human resource functions to us for two years  at the lower of clr s cost to provide the services or  per year 
during the third quarter of  we hired a director of information technology and a director of human resources and transitioned these services away from clr 
ebitda 
we define ebitda as net income plus interest expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation  amortization and accretion expense 
ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda is also a financial measurement that  with certain negotiated adjustments  is reported to our lenders and is used as a gauge for compliance with some of our financial covenants under our credit facility 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
for a reconciliation of ebitda to the most comparable gaap financial measure  please see item selected historical financial and operating data 
how we manage our operations our management team uses a variety of tools to manage our business 
these tools include flow and transaction monitoring systems  producer activity evaluation and reporting  and imbalance monitoring and control 
flow and transaction monitoring systems 
we utilize a customized system that tracks commercial activity on a daily basis at each of our gathering systems  processing plants and treating and fractionation facilities 
we track and monitor inlet volumes to our facilities  fuel consumption  ngls and ngl products extracted  condensate volumes and residue sales volumes 
we also monitor daily operational throughput at our air compression and water injection facilities 
producer activity evaluation and reporting 
we monitor the producer drilling and completion activity in our primary areas of operation to identify anticipated changes in production and potential new well attachment opportunities 
the continued connection of natural gas production to our gathering systems is critical to our business and directly impacts our financial performance 
we receive daily summaries of new drilling permits and completion reports filed with the state regulatory agencies that govern these activities on all of our gathering systems 
producers that have dedicated acreage to our bakken gathering system provide us with their projected annual drilling schedules  which are updated periodically 
additionally  our field personnel report the locations of new wells in their respective areas and anticipated changes in production volumes to supply representatives and operating personnel at our corporate offices 
these processes enhance our awareness of new well activity in our operating areas and allow us to be responsive to producers in connecting new volumes of natural gas to our pipelines 
imbalance monitoring and control 
we continually monitor volumes we deliver to pipelines and volumes nominated for sale on pipelines to ensure we remain within acceptable imbalance limits during a calendar month 
we seek to reduce imbalances because of the inherent commodity risk that results when deliveries and sales of natural gas are not balanced concurrently 
our contracts because of the significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  our contract mix can have a significant impact on our profitability 
in order to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk and where market conditions permit  we pursue arrangements under which we purchase natural gas from the producers at the wellhead at an index based price less a fixed fee to gather  dehydrate  compress  treat and or process their natural gas  referred to as fee based arrangements or contracts 
actual contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographical location  the competitive environment at the time the contract is executed and customer requirements 
our contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  our expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
our natural gas sales contracts we sell natural gas on intrastate and interstate pipelines to marketing affiliates of natural gas pipelines  marketing affiliates of integrated oil companies and utilities 
we typically sell natural gas on a monthly basis under index related pricing terms 
in addition  we have one forward sales contract to sell  mmbtu of natural gas at per mmbtu on our eagle chief  matli and kinta area gathering systems 
we also use cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to changing natural gas prices 
under these hedges we settle monthly on the difference between the sales or purchases of future production to or from our counterparty at fixed prices and the price that will be established on the date of hedge settlement by reference to a specified index price 
these hedge contracts currently cover periods of up to twenty four months from the date of the hedge 
our ngl sales arrangements we sell ngls and ngl products at the tailgate of our facilities to oneok hydrocarbon  lp  semstream  lp  and a subsidiary of kinder morgan energy partners  lp we typically sell ngls and ngl products on a monthly basis under index related pricing terms in our mid continent region and at market prices in our rocky mountain region 
we also use cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to changing ngl prices 
under these hedges we settle monthly on the difference between the sales of future production to our counterparty at a fixed price and the price that will be established on the date of hedge settlement by reference to a specified index price 
these hedges currently cover periods of up to twelve months from the date of the hedge 
hedging contracts to insure that our hedging financial instruments will be used solely for hedging commodity price risks and not for speculative purposes  we continually review our hedges for compliance with our hedging policies and procedures 
we recognize gains and losses from the settlement of our hedges in revenue when we either sell or buy the associated physical residue natural gas or sell the associated physical natural gas liquid 
any gain or loss realized as a result of hedging is substantially offset in the market when we either sell or buy the physical residue natural gas or sell the physical natural gas liquid 
all of our hedges are characterized as cash flow hedges as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
we determine gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions based upon the difference between the hedge price and the physical price 
for a more detailed discussion on our hedging activity  please read commodity price risks included in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our natural gas purchase and gathering contracts with respect to our natural gas gathering  compression  dehydrating  treating  processing and marketing activities and our ngl fractionation activities  we contract under four types of arrangements 
under all contracts except the fixed fee gathering arrangement  we are required to purchase the supplied gas  subject to the demands of our resale purchasers and the operating conditions and capacity of our facilities 
we do not guarantee the purchase of any particular quantity of the gas which is available for sale 
the supplier delivers the gas to us at the inlet of our gathering systems and we obtain title to the gas at the delivery point 
the gas delivered to us is required to meet specified quality requirements 
under the fixed fee gathering arrangement  we do not purchase or take title to the gas supplied to us 
the following is a summary of the four types of natural gas purchase contracts that accounted for the largest percentage of volumes purchased for the years ended december   and percentage of proceeds arrangements 
under percentage of proceeds arrangements  we generally purchase natural gas from producers at the wellhead  gather  treat  and process the natural gas  in some cases fractionate the ngls into ngl products  and then sell the resulting residue gas and ngls or ngl products at index related prices 
we remit to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds for the natural gas and the ngls 
under these types of arrangements  our revenues and total segment margin correlate directly with the price of natural gas and ngls 
for the years ended december   and we purchased  and of our total volumes under these types of fee arrangements  respectively 
percentage of index arrangements 
under percentage of index arrangements  we purchase natural gas from the producers at the wellhead at a price that is at a fixed percentage of the index price for the natural gas that they produce 
we then gather  treat and process the natural gas  in some cases fractionate the ngls into ngl products and then sell the residue gas and ngls or ngl products pursuant to natural gas or ngl arrangements described above 
since under these types of arrangements our costs to purchase the natural gas from the producer is based on the price of natural gas  our total segment margin under these arrangements increases as the price of ngls increase relative to the price of natural gas  and our total segment margin under these arrangements decreases as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
for the years ended december   and we purchased  and of our total volumes under these types of fee arrangements  respectively 
fixed fee arrangements 
under fixed fee arrangements  we purchase natural gas from the producers at the wellhead at an index based price less a fixed fee to gather  dehydrate  compress  treat and or process their natural gas 
these types of arrangements typically require us to pay the producer for the value of the wellhead gas less the applicable fee 
since under these types of arrangements our costs to purchase the natural gas from the producer is based on the price of natural gas  our total segment margin under these arrangements increases as the price of ngls increase relative to the price of natural gas  and our total segment margin under these arrangements decreases as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
for the years ended december   and  we purchased  and of our total volumes under these types of fee arrangements  respectively 
fixed fee gathering arrangements 
under fixed fee gathering arrangements  we gather  dehydrate  compress and treat natural gas supplied to our gathering systems and redeliver the compressed natural gas for a fixed fee 
under these arrangements  we do not take title to the natural gas 
we gathered an average of  mmbtu d for and from the period may   the date we acquired the kinta area gas gathering assets  through december   we gathered an average of  mmbtu d 
compression services agreement under the compression services agreement that we entered into with clr in connection with our initial public offering and effective as of january   clr pays us a fixed monthly fee to provide compressed air and water at pressures sufficient to allow for the injection of either air or water into underground reservoirs for oil and gas secondary recovery operations 
under the compression services agreement  clr is responsible for the provision to us of power and water to be utilized in the compression process 
if our facilities do not meet the monthly volume requirements for compressed air and water  and the failure is not attributable to clr s failure to supply power or water or a force majeure  the fixed monthly payment will be reduced in proportion to the volumes of air or water we were unable to deliver during such month 
clr may terminate the compression services agreement if we are unable to deliver any compressed air and water for a period of more than consecutive days and the failure is not attributable to clr s failure to supply power or water or a force majeure 
the agreement has an initial term ending january  and will thereafter automatically renew for additional one month terms unless terminated by either party by giving notice at least days prior to the end of the then current term 
our growth strategy our growth strategy contemplates engaging in construction and expansion opportunities as well as complementary acquisitions of midstream assets in our operating areas 
we intend to pursue construction and expansion projects to meet new or increased demand for our midstream services 
in addition  we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will allow us to capitalize on our existing infrastructure  personnel and producer and customer relationships to provide an integrated package of services 
we may also pursue selected acquisitions in new geographic areas to the extent they present growth opportunities similar to those we are pursuing in our existing areas of operations 
to successfully execute our growth strategy  we will require access to capital on competitive terms 
we intend to finance future acquisitions primarily by using the capacity available under our bank credit facility and equity or debt offerings or a combination of both 
capital expenditures 
we make capital expenditures either to maintain our assets or the supply to our assets or for expansion projects to increase our total segment margin 
maintenance capital is capital employed to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives  or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows 
expansion capital expenditures represent capital expenditures made to expand or increase the efficiency of the existing operating capacity of our assets 
expansion capital expenditures include expenditures that facilitate an increase in volumes within our operations  whether through construction or acquisition 
expenditures that reduce our operating costs will be considered expansion capital expenditures only if the reduction in operating expenses exceeds cost reductions typically resulting from routine maintenance 
our decisions whether to spend capital on expansion projects are generally based on the target rate of return  as well as the cash flow capabilities of the assets 
acquisitions 
in analyzing a particular acquisition  we consider the operational  financial and strategic benefits of the transaction 
our analysis includes location of the assets  strategic fit of the asset in relation to our business strategy  expertise required to manage the asset  capital required to integrate and maintain the asset  and the competitive environment of the area where the assets are located 
from a financial perspective  we analyze the rate of return the assets will generate under various case scenarios  comparative market parameters and cash flow capabilities of the assets 
items impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable  either from period to period or going forward  for the reasons described below 
our formation we were formed in october to own and operate the assets that have historically been owned and operated by cgi and hiland partners  llc 
as part of our formation  immediately prior to consummation of our initial public offering  the former owners of cgi and hiland partners  llc contributed to us all of the assets and operations of cgi other than a portion of its working capital assets and all of the assets and operations of hiland partners  llc  other than a portion of its working capital assets and the assets related to the bakken gathering system 
effective september   we acquired hiland partners  llc  which owns the bakken gathering system 
cgi is our predecessor for accounting purposes and has historically owned all of our natural gas gathering  processing and fractionation assets other than the worland and bakken gathering systems and the kinta area gathering systems we acquired on may  as a result  our historical financial statements for the periods prior to february  are the financial statements of cgi 
hiland partners  llc has historically owned our worland gathering system  our horse creek compression facility  our cedar hills water injection plant located next to our cedar hills compression facility and the bakken gathering system 
restructuring of compression facilities lease prior to our initial public offering  hiland partners  llc owned our horse creek air compression facility and our cedar hills water injection facility 
in  hiland partners  llc entered into a five year lease agreement with clr  pursuant to which hiland partners  llc leased the facilities to clr 
clr used its own personnel to operate the facilities  and hiland partners  llc made no operational decisions 
in connection with our formation and our initial public offering  we entered into a four year services agreement with clr  effective as of january   that replaced the existing lease 
under the services agreement  we own and operate the facilities and provide air compression and water injection services to clr for a fee 
as part of the restructuring  the personnel at clr that operated the facilities were transferred to us 
under the new services agreement  we receive a fixed payment of approximately million per year as compared to million per year under the prior lease agreement 
in connection with the new services arrangement  we incur approximately million per year in additional operating costs 
for a description of the restructured agreement  please read our contracts compression services agreement 
construction and acquisition activities since our inception  we have grown through a combination of building gas gathering and processing assets and acquisitions 
for example  we commenced operation of the matli gathering system in  constructed the original matli processing plant in and completed the construction of a new processing plant in additionally  we acquired the worland gathering system in and the carmen gathering system in we acquired the carmen gathering system in as an expansion of our eagle chief gathering system 
prior to our acquisition of the carmen gathering system  we purchased the gas from the previous owner  processed it and returned it to the previous owner pursuant to a keep whole arrangement 
after we acquired the carmen gathering system  we terminated this keep whole arrangement and now sell the gas at the tailgate of the eagle chief processing plant 
in addition  we completed the bakken acquisition in september these historical acquisitions were completed at different dates and with numerous sellers and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  results from such acquisitions are recorded in the financial statements only from the date of acquisition 
we acquired the kinta area gathering assets in may and operate the gathering assets substantially differently than were operated by the previous owner 
since there was no sufficient continuity of the kinta area gathering assets operations prior to and after our acquisition  disclosure of prior financial information would not be material to an understanding of future operations 
therefore  the acquisition has been recorded as a purchase of assets and not of a business 
we expanded our processing plant and our existing field gathering infrastructure and constructed a  mcf d nitrogen rejection plant at our badlands gas gathering system located in bowman county  north dakota 
we also entered into a five year definitive purchase agreement with a producer and have constructed additional compression facilities and expanded our existing badlands gas gathering system into south dakota 
we have installed additional gathering and compression infrastructure at our bakken gathering system to increase the system s capacity from approximately  mcf d to  mcf d and expanded the existing ngl fractionation facilities at the processing plant to fractionate increased ngl volumes from both the bakken processing plant and the badlands processing plant 
we completed the installation of additional pipelines and compression facilities and increased our system capacity at our eagle chief gathering system from approximately  mcf d to approximately  mcf d due to increased volumes on this system 
we completed the construction of a  mcf d natural gas processing facility along our existing matli gas gathering system which now provides additional plant processing capacity for increased system volumes 
we installed four  mcf d capacity amine treating facilities at several of our kinta area gathering system locations to remove excess carbon dioxide levels from the natural gas 
in december  we entered into an agreement to construct and operate gathering pipelines and related facilities associated with the development of a portion of the acreage owned by clr in the woodford shale play in the arkoma basin of southeastern oklahoma 
we are in the process installing field gathering  compression and associated equipment 
the new gathering system will be designed to provide low pressure and highly reliable gathering  compression and dehydration services 
the gathering infrastructure is expected to include more than  horsepower of compression to provide takeaway capacity in excess of  mcf d 
startup of the initial phase of the project occurred during the second quarter of our results of operations set forth in the tables below are financial and operating data for our predecessor  cgi  and us for the periods indicated

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues midstream and compression were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this million increase was largely due to i revenues associated with natural gas sales volumes related to our woodford shale gathering system which commenced production on april   ii a full year of natural gas sales volumes in related to our acquisition of the kinta area gathering assets effective may   iii increased natural gas sales volumes at our eagle chief and bakken gathering systems  iv revenues related to increased ngl sales volumes at our woodford shale  bakken  badlands and eagle chief gathering systems and v increased average realized ngl sales prices partially offset by lower average realized natural gas sales prices in as compared to the same period in revenues from compression assets were the same for both periods 
our midstream revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a net increase of million  or 
of this increase in midstream revenues  approximately million was attributable to natural gas sales volumes related to our woodford shale gathering system  a full year of natural gas sales volumes and gathering fee volumes in associated with the kinta area gathering assets acquisition effective may  and increased natural gas and ngl sales volumes at our bakken  badlands and eagle chief gathering systems 
midstream revenues increased by approximately million due to increased ngl sales prices offset by million as a result of lower natural gas sales prices compared to our woodford shale gathering system  which began production in late april  accounted for of the million increase contributing million to midstream revenues 
inlet natural gas volumes were  mcf d for the year ended december  compared to  mcf d for the year ended december   an increase of  mcf d  or 
of the  mcf d increase   mcf d  or was attributable to inlet mcf d at our kinta area gathering system for a full year in which we acquired effective may   and the remaining  mcf d increase was primarily attributable to inlet mcf d at our woodford shale gathering system and increased inlet mcf d at our eagle chief  bakken and badlands gathering systems 
natural gas sales volumes were  mmbtu d for the year ended december  compared to  mmbtu d for the year ended december   an increase of  mmbtu d  or 
the increase of  mmbtu d was primarily attributable to the increased natural gas volumes as a result of a full year of operations in at our kinta area gathering system which we acquired effective may  and to increased volumes at both our bakken and eagle chief gathering systems and our new woodford shale gathering system  which contributed  mmbtu d to the increase in natural gas sales volumes 
our ngl sales volumes were  bbls d for the year ended december  compared to  bbls d for the year ended december   an increase of  bbls d  or 
of the  bbls d increase  bbls d  or was attributable to ngl sales volumes at our woodford shale gathering system and bbls d  or was attributable to increased ngl sales volumes at our bakken  eagle chief and badlands gathering systems 
our average realized natural gas sales prices were per mmbtu for the year ended december  compared to per mmbtu for the year ended december   a decrease of per mmbtu  or 
our average realized ngl sales prices were per gallon for the year ended december  compared to per gallon for the year ended december   an increase of per gallon or 
the change in our average realized natural gas sales prices was primarily a result of lower index prices due to a softening of supply and demand fundamentals for energy  which caused natural gas prices to fall during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the change in our average realized ngl sales prices was primarily a result of higher index prices due to a tightening of supply and demand fundamentals for energy  which caused ngl prices to rise during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash received from our counterparty on cash flow swap contracts that began on may  for natural gas derivative transactions that closed during the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  these receipts increased average realized natural gas sales prices by per mmbtu in and by per mmbtu in cash paid to our counterparty on cash flow swap contracts that began on september  for ngl derivative transactions that closed during the year ended december  was million 
these payments decreased average realized natural gas sales prices by per gallon in closed ngl derivative transactions during the year ended december  were insignificant 
fees earned from  mmbtu d of natural gas gathered  in which we do not take title to the gas  related to our kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  were million for the year ended december  similar fees earned from may  through december  averaging  mmbtu d of natural gas gathered was million 
the increase of million in fees earned was primarily due to a full year of operations in as compared to eight months of operations in  and partially attributable to treating fees earned related to the four amine treating facilities installed in early gathering fees earned during the year ended december as compared to the eight month period in were somewhat offset by a  mmbtu d reduction in volumes gathered 
our compression revenues were million for the each of the year ended december  and midstream purchases 
our midstream purchases were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the million increase primarily consists of million  or attributable to purchased natural gas from our woodford shale gathering system and million  or  attributable to purchased natural gas from our kinta area gathering assets for a full year of operations in the remaining increase in midstream purchases was attributable to increased purchased residue gas volumes at our bakken  eagle chief and badlands gathering systems 
the increase in volumes was offset by reduced payments to producers due primarily to lower natural gas purchase prices  which generally are closely related to fluctuations in natural gas sales prices 
operations and maintenance 
our operations and maintenance expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million  or was attributable to a full year of operations and maintenance expense at our kinta area gathering system 
operations and maintenance expense also increased by million  or at our badlands gathering facility largely due to compressor rentals and other related costs associated with our expansion project 
our new woodford shale gathering system contributed million to the increase in operations and maintenance expense and our bakken and eagle chief gathering systems  as a result of increased volumes  contributed million to the increase in operations and maintenance expense 
depreciation  amortization and accretion 
our depreciation  amortization and accretion expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million  or was attributable to depreciation and amortization on our kinta area gathering system for a full year of operations in the increase is also attributable to additional depreciation related to our internal organic growth projects completed in of million  or at our bakken gathering system and million  or at our badlands gathering system  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to million of acquisition evaluation expenses  million of non cash compensation expense related to unit option awards and restricted and phantom unit awards and million due to increased salaries and salary related expenses as a result of additional staffing  including costs of recruitment 
other income expense 
our other income expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase in expense of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to additional interest expense from a full year of borrowings on our credit facility for the acquisition of the kinta area gathering assets effective may  and to interest expense for our internal plant and pipeline expansion projects at our badlands  woodford shale and bakken gathering systems in year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues midstream and compression were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to i increased volumes of  mmbtu d of natural gas sales  and  bbls d of ngl sales attributable to our acquisition of the bakken gathering system effective september   ii increased volumes of approximately  mmbtu d of natural gas sales and  mmbtu d of natural gas gathered for the eight months ended december  from the kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may   iii additional volumes attributable to the worland gathering system which was contributed to us on february  and iv increased revenues from compression assets also contributed to us on february  midstream revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this net increase  million was attributable to higher residue natural gas and ngl sales volumes offset by a decrease of million attributable to decreased average realized natural gas and ngl prices 
increased volumes in on the bakken gathering system we acquired effective september  and on the kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  represented million and million  respectively of the increase in midstream revenues 
this combined increase of million was primarily offset by a decrease of million as a result of lower natural sales gas and ngl sales prices in as compared to the inclusion of worland gathering system for the entire year in as compared to only ten and one half months in also contributed to the volume increase for as compared to natural gas sales volumes were  mmbtu d for the year ended december  compared to  mmbtu d for the year ended december   an increase of  mmbtu d  or 
of the  mmbtu d increase   mmbtu d  or was attributable to natural gas volumes as a result of our bakken gathering system acquisition effective september  and  mmbtu d  or was attributable to the natural gas volumes as a result of our kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  our ngl sales volumes were  bbls d for the year ended december  compared to  bbls d for the year ended december   an increase of  bbls d  or 
of the  bbls d increase   bbls d  or was attributable to our bakken gathering system 
increased volumes at our eagle chief gathering system of  mmbtu d and bbls d also contributed to our overall increase in volumes for as compared to average realized natural gas sales prices were per mmbtu for the year ended december  compared to per mmbtu for the year ended december   a decrease of per mmbtu  or 
average realized ngl sales prices were per gallon for the year ended december  compared to per gallon for the year ended december   an increase of per gallon or 
the decrease in our average realized natural gas sales prices was primarily a result of lower index prices due to a softening of supply and demand fundamentals for energy  which caused natural gas prices to fall during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash received from our counterparty on cash flow swap contracts that began on may  for natural gas derivative transactions that closed during the year ended december  totaled million 
this gain increased average realized natural gas sales prices to per mmbtu from per mmbtu  an increase of per mmbtu  or 
we had no closed derivative transactions during the year ended december  fees earned from an eight month average of  mmbtu d of natural gas gathered  in which we do not take title to the gas  related to our kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  were million for the year ended december  the eight month average of  mmbtu d equates to an average  mmbtu d for the year ended december  we had no similar fees from natural gas gathering during the year ended december  compression revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the compression assets were contributed to us by hiland partners  llc on february  accordingly  revenues from these assets were only included for ten and one half months of the year ended december  midstream purchases 
midstream purchases were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
purchases increased by million as a result of increased natural gas and ngl volumes as a result of our bakken gathering system acquisition effective september  and by million from increased natural gas volumes from our kinta area gathering assets acquisition which began on may  this combined increase of million was primarily offset by million in reduced payments to producers due to lower natural gas and ngl purchase prices  which generally are closely related to fluctuations in natural gas and ngl sales prices 
operations and maintenance 
operations and maintenance expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million  or was attributable to operations and maintenance as a result of our kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  and million  or was attributable to operations and maintenance at our bakken gathering system we acquired effective september  higher costs of chemicals and lube oil  combined with increased wages due to internal expansions caused an increase in operations and maintenance of million in our eagle chief  matli  badlands and worland gathering systems in as compared to depreciation  amortization and accretion

of this increase  million  or was attributable to depreciation and amortization on our kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may  and million  or was attributable to depreciation and amortization on our bakken gathering system we acquired effective september  depreciation at our eagle chief  matli  badlands and worland gathering systems increased by million in as compared to as a result of internal capital expansions completed in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased salaries and additional staffing of million as a result of growth and million in sarbanes oxley internal control compliance costs and audit and tax preparation fees 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase in expense of million 
interest expense increased million 
the increase is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with borrowings of million on our credit facility to partially finance the kinta area gathering assets we acquired on may   the interest expense associated with the partial financing of the acquisition of the bakken gathering system effective september  and additional interest expense on million invested in maintenance and expansion capital expenditure projects in as compared to million in general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us  and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our expectations may vary materially from actual results 
please see forward looking statements 
us gas supply and outlook 
we believe that current natural gas prices will continue to result in relatively high levels of natural gas related drilling as producers seek to increase their level of natural gas production 
although the number of us natural gas wells drilled has increased overall in recent years  a corresponding increase in production has not been realized  primarily as a result of smaller discoveries 
we believe that an increase in us drilling activity and additional sources of supply such as liquefied natural gas imports will be required for the natural gas industry to meet the expected increased demand for  and to compensate for the slowing production of  natural gas in the united states 
a number of the areas in which we operate are experiencing significant drilling activity as result of recent favorable natural gas prices  new discoveries and the implementation of new exploration and production techniques 
we believe that this higher level of activity will continue 
we also believe that our badlands gathering system is located in an area where ongoing secondary recovery operations will provide us with additional natural gas volumes 
while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities in a number of the areas in which we operate  fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of our operations 
midstream segment margins 
during  our midstream segment margins were positively impacted due to increased volumes and ngl prices but were negatively impacted due to reduced natural gas prices resulting in a net increase in margins from during  our midstream segment margins were positively impacted due to increased volumes but were negatively impacted due to reduced natural gas prices and ngl prices  resulting in a net increase in margins from our profitability is dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
interest rate environment 
interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels  causing our financing costs to increase accordingly 
although this could limit our ability to raise funds in the debt capital markets  we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects  as our competitors would face similar circumstances 
as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield 
the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield oriented securities for investment decision making purposes 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  reduce debt or for other purposes 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources overview cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and funds from private and future public equity and debt offerings are our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that funds from these sources should be sufficient to meet both our short term working capital requirements and our long term capital expenditure requirements 
our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders  to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received cash flows from customers of approximately million  had cash payments to our suppliers and employees of approximately million and payment of interest expense of million  net of amounts capitalized  resulting in cash received from our operating activities of million 
during the year ended december   we received cash flows from customers of approximately million  had cash payments to our suppliers and employees of approximately million and payment of interest expense of million  net of amounts capitalized  resulting in cash received from our operating activities of million 
changes in cash receipts and payments are primarily due to the timing of collections at the end of our reporting periods 
we collect and pay large receivables and payables at the end of each calendar month 
the timing of these payments and receipts may vary by a day or two between month end periods and cause fluctuations in cash received or paid 
natural gas and ngl volumes from our new woodford shale gathering system and increased natural gas and ngl volumes from our bakken  badlands and eagle chief gathering systems combined with increased ngl sales prices  but offset by lower natural gas sales prices contributed to increases in accounts receivable  accrued midstream revenues  accounts payable and accrued midstream purchases during the year ended december  working capital items  exclusive of cash  used million in cash flows from operating activities and contributed million to cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  and  respectively 
net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from a net income of million for the year ended december  depreciation  amortization and accretion increased by million or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cash flows used for investing activities 
our cash flows used for investing activities representing our internal organic growth investments in property and equipment  increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase is largely attributable to cash invested at our new woodford shale gathering system  our badlands expansion project and continued growth at our bakken gathering system 
we had no asset acquisitions in in may  million of cash flows was used for our kinta area gathering assets acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flows from financing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we borrowed million under our credit facility to fund our internal expansion projects  received capital contributions of million as a result of issuing common units due to the exercise of  vested unit options  made capital lease obligation payments of million  distributed million to our unitholders  incurred offering costs of million associated with our s a registration statement filed with the sec on january  and paid debt issuance costs of million associated with our third amended credit facility

also during the year ended december   we received capital contributions of million from our general partner in exchange for the issuance of  common units and general partner equivalent units  received million as a result of issuing common units due to the exercise of  vested unit options  paid debt issuance costs of million and distributed million to our unitholders 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is attributable to higher net income plus depreciation and amortization during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in addition  changes in working capital items exclusive of cash contributed million to cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  as compared to reducing cash flows from operating activities by million for the year ended december  the use of cash in operating activities in was primarily a result of replenishing our accounts receivable after the closing of our initial public offering and increased accounts receivable as a result of higher realized prices for natural gas and ngls at december  in connection with our formation  million of cgi accounts receivables was retained by former owners of cgi 
accounts receivables increased at december  as compared to december  as a result of receivables related to our acquisition of the kinta area gathering assets  but were offset by decreased natural gas and ngl prices at december  as compared to natural gas and ngl prices at december  accounts payable and accrued midstream purchases as of december  increased due to increased vendor payables relating to internal expansion and growth projects and additional accounts payable relating to the operations of the kinta area gathering assets acquired on may   both of which were offset by a reduction in midstream purchases payable due to reduced natural gas and ngl purchase prices at december  as compared to natural gas and ngl prices at december  cash flows used for investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities  which represent investments in property and equipment and payments made for acquisitions  increased to million from million  an increase of million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of the kinta area gathering assets acquisition on may   the ongoing progress on our badlands expansion project  continued growth at our bakken gathering system and various other internal expansion projects 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flows from financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we borrowed million under our credit facility to partially fund the kinta area gathering assets acquisition on may  and to fund our internal expansion projects at badlands  kinta and bakken 
during the year ended december   we received capital contributions of million from our general partner in exchange for the issuance of  common units and  general partner equivalent units and million as a result of issuing common units due to the exercise of  vested unit options

the proceeds from the public offering were used to pay remaining offering costs of million and deferred debt issuance costs of million  pay outstanding indebtedness of million  redeem million of common units from an affiliate of harold hamm and the hamm trusts  and make a million distribution to the previous owners of hiland partners  llc 
we retained million to replenish working capital 
during the period from january  to february   cgi repaid million of its outstanding indebtedness 
capital requirements the midstream energy business is capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
our capital requirements have consisted primarily of  and we anticipate will continue to be maintenance capital expenditures  which are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives  or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows  and expansion capital expenditures such as those to acquire additional assets to grow our business  to expand and upgrade gathering systems  processing plants  treating facilities and fractionation facilities and to construct or acquire similar systems or facilities 
given our objective of growth through acquisitions and expansions  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
we actively consider a variety of assets for potential acquisitions

financial derivatives and commodity hedges 
we have entered into certain financial derivative instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 as amended  and relate to forecasted sales in and we entered into these instruments to hedge the forecasted natural gas and ngl sales or purchases against the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in market prices 
the swap instruments are contractual agreements between a counterparty and us to exchange obligations of money as the underlying natural gas or ngls are sold or purchased 
under these swap agreements  we either receive or pay a monthly net settlement that is determined by the difference between a fixed price and a floating price based on certain indices for the relevant contract period for the agreed upon volumes

we have executed one natural gas fixed price physical forward sales contract on  mmbtu per month for with a fixed price of per mmbtu 
this contract has been designated as a normal sale under sfas no 
and is therefore not marked to market as a derivative 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we had no significant off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or december  credit facility on february   we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit facility dated as of february  pursuant to the fourth amendment  we have  among other things  increased our borrowing base from million  to million and decreased the accordion feature in the facility from million to million 
our original credit facility dated may was first amended in september  amended a second time in june and amended a third time in july the fourth amendment increases our borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility to million such that the facility now consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility to be used for funding acquisitions and other capital expenditures  issuance of letters of credit and general corporate purposes the acquisition facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility to be used for working capital and to fund distributions the working capital facility 
in addition  the fourth amendment provides for an accordion feature  which permits us  if certain conditions are met  to increase the size of the acquisition facility by up to million and allows for the issuance of letters of credit of up to million in the aggregate 
the senior secured revolving credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial tests  including a maximum consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio of as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  provided that in the event that the partnership makes certain permitted acquisitions or capital expenditures  this ratio may be increased to for the three fiscal quarters following the quarter in which such acquisition or capital expenditure occurs  and a minimum interest coverage ratio of the credit facility will mature in may at that time  the agreement will terminate and all outstanding amounts thereunder will be due and payable

at december   the interest rate on outstanding borrowings from our credit facility was 
the credit facility prohibits us from making distributions to unitholders if any default or event of default  as defined in the credit facility  has occurred and is continuing or would result from the distribution 
in addition  the credit facility contains various covenants that limit  among other things  subject to certain exceptions and negotiated baskets  our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make certain loans  acquisitions and investments  make any material changes to the nature of its business  amend its material agreements  including the omnibus agreement or enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of assets

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement amends and replaces sfas no 
 but retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and an acquirer be identified for each business combination 
the statement provides for how the acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r provides for how the acquirer recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
the statement also determines what information to disclose to enable users to be able to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the provisions of sfas r apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and do not allow early adoption 
we are evaluating the new requirements of statement no 
r and the impact it will have on business combinations completed in or thereafter 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent minority interest be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
sfas no 
requires the equity amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement and that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently and similarly as equity transactions 
consolidated net income and comprehensive income will be determined without deducting minority interest  however  earnings per share information will continue to be calculated on the basis of the net income attributable to the parent s shareholders 
additionally  sfas no 
establishes a single method for accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation and that the parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement was adopted by us effective january   at which time no financial assets or liabilities  not previously required to be recorded at fair value by other authoritative literature  were designated to be recorded at fair value 
as such  the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap such as fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements ie  market based or non market based and expands disclosure about fair value measurements based on their level in the hierarchy 
this statement applies to derivatives and other financial instruments  which statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires be measured at fair value at initial recognition and for all subsequent periods 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively in the first quarter of and do not expect any significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
revenues for sales of natural gas and ngls product sales are recognized at the time the product is delivered and title is transferred 
revenues for compression services are recognized when the services under the agreement are performed 
revenues from oil and gas production discontinued operations were recorded in the month produced and title was transferred to the purchaser 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of all equipment is determined under the straight line method using various rates based on useful lives  to years for pipeline and processing plants  and to years for corporate and other assets 
the cost of assets and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts when such assets are disposed of  and any related gains or losses are reflected in current earnings 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are expensed as incurred 
costs of replacements constituting improvement are capitalized 
intangible assets consist of the acquired value of existing contracts to sell natural gas and other ngls  compression contracts and identifiable customer relationships  which do not have significant residual value 
the contracts are being amortized over their estimated lives of ten years 
derivatives 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce commodity price risks 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended in june by sfas no 
and in may by sfas no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge  depending upon the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments through income  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in income 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized into income 
if a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income will be immediately charged to operations 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
subsequently  the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method and the liability is accreted to measure the change in liability due to the passage of time 
the primary impact of this standard relates to our estimated costs for dismantling and site restoration of certain of our plants and pipelines 
estimating future asset retirement obligations requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
we use the present value of estimated cash flows related to our asset retirement obligation to determine the fair value  generally as estimated by third party consultants 
the present value calculation requires us to make numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate costs of dismantling and site restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment will be required to the related asset 
we believe the estimates and judgments reflected in our financial statements are reasonable but are necessarily subject to the uncertainties we have just described 
accordingly  any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets  including intangible assets  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is re determined when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves providing asset cash flow and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including  but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which the partnership s products are located  the availability and prices of ngl products and competing commodities  the availability and prices of raw natural gas supply  our ability to negotiate favorable marketing agreements  the risks that third party oil and gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers and producers of natural gas  and competition from other midstream service providers and processors  including major energy companies 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
share based compensation 
in october the fasb issued sfas no 
 share based payment  which was revised in december sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that cost be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we adopted sfas r as of january  and applied sfas r using the permitted modified prospective method beginning as of the same date and our unearned deferred compensation of as of january  has been eliminated against common unit equity 
prior to january  we recorded any unamortized compensation related to restricted unit awards as unearned compensation in equity 
we expect no change to our cash flow presentation from the adoption of sfas r since no tax benefits are recognized by us as a pass through entity 
we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the american binomial option pricing model 
in estimating the fair value of each option  we use our peer group volatility averages as determined on the option grant dates 
we calculate expected lives of the options under the simplified method as prescribed by the sec staff accounting bulletin and have used a risk free interest rate based on the applicable us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
our compensation expense for these awards is recognized on the graded vesting attribution method 
units to be issued under our unit incentive plan may be from newly issued units

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is commodity price risk for natural gas and ngls 
we also incur  to a lesser extent  risks related to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not engage in commodity energy trading activities 
commodity price risks 
our profitability is affected by volatility in prevailing ngl and natural gas prices 
historically  changes in the prices of most ngl products have generally correlated with changes in the price of crude oil 
ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in the supply and demand for ngls and natural gas  as well as market uncertainty 
for a discussion of the volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  please read risk factors risk factors related to our business our cash flow is affected by the volatility of natural gas and ngl product prices  which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
to illustrate the impact of changes in prices for natural gas and ngls on our operating results  we have provided the table below  which reflects  for the year ended december   the impact on our total segment margin of a per gallon change increase or decrease in ngl prices coupled with a per mmbtu change increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
natural gas price change mmbtu ngl price   change gal   the magnitude of the impact on total segment margin of changes in natural gas and ngl prices presented may not be representative of the magnitude of the impact on total segment margin for different commodity prices or contract portfolios 
natural gas prices can also affect our profitability indirectly by influencing the level of drilling activity and related opportunities for our services 
we manage this commodity price exposure through an integrated strategy that includes management of our contract portfolio  optimization of our assets and the use of derivative contracts 
as a result of these derivative contracts  we have hedged a portion of our expected exposure to natural gas prices and ngl prices in and we continually monitor our hedging and contract portfolio and expect to continue to adjust our hedge position as conditions warrant
