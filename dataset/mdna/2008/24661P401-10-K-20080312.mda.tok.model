dollars in thousands years ended december  statement of operations data costs and expenses operating loss net loss years ended december  balance sheet data current assets total assets current liabilities stockholder s equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation since our founding in by a team of physicians  we have been a development stage company engaged primarily in developing and testing the delcath system for the treatment of liver cancer 
a substantial portion of our historical expenses have been for the development of our medical device and the clinical trials of our product  and the pursuit of patents worldwide  as described in item under patents  trade secrets and proprietary rights 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses from costs for product development  clinical studies  securing patents  regulatory activities  manufacturing and establishment of a sales and marketing organization without any significant revenues 
a detailed description of the cash used to fund historical operations is included in the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
without an fda approved product and commercial sales  we will continue to be dependent upon existing cash and the sale of equity or debt to fund future activities 
while the amount of future net losses and time required to reach profitability are uncertain  our ability to generate significant revenue and become profitable will depend on our success in commercializing our device 
during  delcath initiated the clinical trial of the delcath system for isolated liver perfusion using the chemotherapeutic agent  melphalan 
enrollment of new patients in the phase i trial was completed in in  we commenced a phase ii clinical trial protocol for the study of the delcath system for inoperable primary liver cancer and adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine cancers that have metastazed to the liver using melphalan 
in  we started enrolling and treating patients in a pivotal phase iii trial for the study of the delcath system for inoperable melanoma in the liver using melphalan under the fda s fast track and spa approved protocol 
on october   we announced that we received on the afternoon of october   a letter from the fda recommending that we temporarily suspend enrollment in the phase iii and phase ii trials of the delcath system  and submit an analysis of adverse events in anticipation of a meeting with the fda to discuss certain gastrointestinal gi safety concerns 
the recommendation was issued by the fda following reports of four serious adverse gi events that were submitted to the fda  the nci institutional review board and the data safety monitoring board  which may have been related to the infusion of melphalan 
following receipt of this letter  we decided to voluntarily defer accrual of new patients in our phase iii and phase ii trials 
during a meeting at the fda which was attended by senior reviewers from both the drug and device arms of the fda  the principal investigator at the nci presented an analysis of the previously reported gastrointestinal toxicities and of the changes incorporated into the trial protocols to prevent a recurrence of the gi toxicities 
these changes had been previously approved by the nci institutional review board and were subsequently approved by the data safety monitoring board for the phase iii trial 
following the meeting  we were notified in writing by the fda that the studies can proceed with the amended protocol  and we announced the notification of trial resumption in a november  press release 
over the next months  we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to the research and development of our technology  including phase iii and phase ii clinical trials clinical trials using melphalan with the delcath system 
additional funds  when available  will be committed to pre clinical and clinical trials for the use of other chemotherapy agents with the delcath system for the treatment of liver cancer  and the development of additional products and components 
we will also continue efforts to qualify additional sources of the key components of our device  in an effort to further reduce manufacturing costs and minimize dependency on a single source of supply 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of  as compared to  at december  and  at december  because money market rates have been equal to or greater than what we could receive in cds  nearly all of our funds are currently invested in money market accounts which are shown in our financial statements as part of cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we used  of cash in our operating activities 
this amount compares to  used in our operating activities during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  the substantial difference in cash used in operating activities between and was primarily due to the legal costs incurred in resolving various legal issues during our cash used in operating activities in returned to a more consistent basis other than the final costs related to the legal issues and an increase in research and development costs in order to speed the fda approval of the delcath system 
we have funded our operations through a combination of private placements of our securities and through the proceeds of our public offerings in  and please see the detailed discussion of our various sales of securities described in note to our financial statements included in this report 
in addition  we received proceeds of approximately million from private placements we completed in  approximately million on exercise of warrants and options in  approximately million from a private placement we completed in  approximately million on exercise of warrants and options in  approximately million on exercise of warrants and options in  approximately million on exercise of options in  and approximately million from the registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants we completed in september although there can be no assurances  management believes that  as of december   the company has sufficient capital to complete our existing phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
we expect our available funds to be sufficient for our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through provided no studies using new agents or treating new organs are initiated outside of the cooperative research and development agreement crada with the national cancer institute nci 
the phase iii trials which are underway at nci received fast track designation from the fda and the trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment spa 
we will be expanding this trial to multiple centers to accelerate enrollment and increase awareness 
we are not projecting any capital expenditures that will significantly affect our liquidity during the next months 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and product development programs  including clinical studies  the timing and costs of making various united states and foreign regulatory filings  obtaining approvals and complying with regulations  the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities  including marketing arrangements overseas  the timing and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an operating lease for office space that will expire on july   with a rent obligation of  per annum 
our five year crada for the development of the delcath system with the nci expired on december  and has been extended for an additional five years to december  the principal goal of the crada is to continue the development of a novel form of regional cancer therapy by designing clinical protocols utilizing the delcath system to regionally deliver chemotherapeutics to patients with unresectable malignancies confined to an organ or region of the body 
under the five year extension  we will pay  per year for clinical support 
these funds are payable in quarterly amounts of  and will be used for material support of the crada including equipment  supplies  travel  and other related crada support  as well as for support of existing or new scientific or clinical staff to be hired by nci who are to perform work under the crada 
future capital needs  additional future funding our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
we have operated at a loss for our entire history and there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve consistent profitability 
we believe that our capital resources are adequate to fund operations for at least the next twelve months  but anticipate that we may require additional working capital after fiscal there can be no assurance that such working capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations for the year ended december   comparisons of results of the years ended december  and we have operated at a loss for our entire history 
we had a net loss for the twelve months ended december   of  which is  or  less than the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this substantial decrease is primarily due to the resolution of various legal matters that had been instituted in  and their related extraordinary costs which were incurred in there were  however  additional expenses relating to a five year extension to the crada with the nci that initially expired in december this extension was necessary for continuing and expanding the collaboration between the company and the nci  but will result in greater costs to the company 
the agreement with the nci required that the annual payments to them be increased five fold from the previous agreement 
additionally  the warrants that were issued in as part of our sale of common stock and warrants are considered to be derivatives and are subject to valuation and adjustment on a quarterly basis see item a  below for a complete description 
this resulted in the recording of derivative income for the year of  which substantially reduced the net loss from continuing operations 
our net loss for the twelve months ended december  was  which is  or  higher than the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this is primarily due to the extraordinary costs incurred in in resolving various legal issues concerning the continuing management of delcath discussed further above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by from  during the twelve months ended december   to  for the twelve months ended december  while legal fees incurred during the current period were substantially less than those incurred in and would have resulted in a greater reduction in period to period expenses due to the resolution of various legal matters  additional charges to general operations were incurred in by share based compensation for options granted to new members of the board of directors  options granted to the president and chief executive officer  and options granted to newly hired management employees 
further  the cashless exercise of options by outgoing members of the board of directors resulted in additional charges to general operations during during the prior year  general and administrative expenses had increased by from  during the twelve months ended december   to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily caused by the extraordinary legal and related costs incurred in along with the recognition of stock option costs in in accordance with the adoption of sfas r see note e stock option plan in the notes to the financial statements included in this report 
research and development expenses during the twelve months ended december   we incurred  in research and development costs  which is a increase as compared to  of research and development costs during this increase is primarily due to increased expenses with the nci  as discussed above  as well as accelerated clinical development costs relating to all facets of the delcath system which has required greater expense but will hasten the progress toward final approval 
in addition  a portion of the share based compensation for options discussed above is allocated to research and development during the twelve months ended december   we incurred an increase in research and development costs of  which was a increase compared to  of research and development costs during the same period in this was primarily caused by an increase in consultant costs along with an allocation of stock option costs in accordance with sfas r as explained above 
interest income interest income shown is from our money market accounts and certificate of deposit cd investments 
during the twelve months ended december   we had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  or a change  for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a reduced cash position in from that in the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants in september were received on the last day of the third quarter of fiscal and therefore did not have a material impact on annual interest income 
interest income in increased by  or  from  in this was the result of the receipt of additional funds and the investment of such funds from a private placement of our common stock at the end of  along with the exercise of outstanding warrants and options during forward looking statements certain statements in this form k  including statements of our and management s expectations  intentions  plans  objectives and beliefs  including those contained in or implied by management s discussion and analysis or plan of operation  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and that are subject to certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we are still in the development stage and have no revenues  trade receivables  inventories  or significant fixed or intangible assets  and therefore have very limited opportunities to choose among accounting policies or methods 
in many cases  we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
additionally  we devote substantial resources to clinical trials and other research and development activities relating to obtaining fda and other approvals for the delcath system  the cost of which is required to be charged to expense as incurred 
this further limits our choice of accounting policies and methods 
similarly  management believes there are very limited circumstances in which our financial statement estimates are significant or critical 
we consider the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate 
in applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  management estimates future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas r in we account for derivatives embedded in contracts  such as warrants  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock 
the accounting guidance requires that the warrants be recorded at fair value for each reporting period with mark to market changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and  therefore  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities 
the company measures all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in contracts  at fair value and recognizes them in the balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on the company s rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares in a private placement to institutional and accredited investors 
the company received net proceeds of  in this transaction 
the company allocated  of the total proceeds to warrants 
the shares were offered by the company pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on form s  which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on may  and was declared effective on june  file no 

the  in proceeds allocated to the warrants was classified as a liability in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrants may require cash settlement in the event of certain circumstances  including the company s inability to deliver registered shares upon the exercise of the warrants by such warrant holders 
the warrants also contain a cashless exercise feature in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the warrants have been accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities which are subject to mark to market adjustment in each period 
as a result  for the year ended december   the company recorded pre tax derivative instrument income of  the resulting derivative instrument liability totaled  at december  management believes that the possibility of an actual cash settlement with a warrant holder of the recorded liability is quite remote  and expects that the warrants will either be exercised or expire worthless  at which point the then existing derivative liability will be credited to equity 
the fair value of the warrants was determined by using the black scholes model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life equal to the september  contractual life of the warrants
