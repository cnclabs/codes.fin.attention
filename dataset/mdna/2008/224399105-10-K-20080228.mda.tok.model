item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware  however  these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business or financial performance 
if any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury  and costs associated with these lawsuits may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial position 
we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury 
estimation of our ultimate exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims 
our estimate of the future expense of these claims is derived from assumptions with respect to future claims  settlement and defense costs which are based on experience during the last few years and which may not prove reliable as predictors 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  depending on the nature of the alleged injury  the jurisdiction where filed and the quality of the product identification  or a significant upward or downward trend in the costs of defending claims  could change the estimated liability  as would any substantial adverse verdict at trial or on appeal 
a legislative solution or a revised structured settlement transaction could also change the estimated liability 
these uncertainties may result in our incurring future charges or increases to income to adjust the carrying value of recorded liabilities and assets  particularly if the number of claims and settlements and defense costs escalates or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented  however  we are currently unable to predict such future events 
the resolution of these claims may take many years  and the effect on results of operations  cash flow and financial position in any given period from a revision to these estimates could be material 
as of december   we were one of a number of defendants in cases involving approximately  pending claims filed in various state and federal courts that allege injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending claims  our historical settlement and defense costs for asbestos claims  the liability we have recorded in our financial statements for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  the asset we have recorded in our financial statements related to our estimated insurance coverage for asbestos claims  and uncertainties related to our net asbestos liability 
we have recorded a liability for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that we will incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be significant  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time 
in the third quarter  we updated and extended the estimate of our asbestos liability and recorded an additional pre tax provision of approximately million  which includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities  costs  litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate  which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water and establish standards for the generation  treatment  use  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 
we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws 
failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties and damage to our reputation 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for example  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a million charge related to an increase in our expected liability at our goodyear  arizona superfund site 
our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation  failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
primarily in our aerospace electronics and fluid handling segments  we are required to comply with various export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts  including requirements related to procurement integrity  export control  employment practices  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
in addition  failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
for example  in the third quarter  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government 
see the civil false claims settlement section under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents part i item a demand for our products is uncertain and subject to factors beyond our control  which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results of operations 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may cause customers demand for our products to be volatile 
these industries often are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures 
reductions in the business levels of these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  a significant decline in demand for air travel  or a decline in airline profitability generally  could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses 
our aerospace businesses could also be impacted if major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented approximately of the segment s revenue in encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could fall if there were a decline in demand for truck trailers  recreational vehicles  or industrial or building products 
results in our controls segment could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the oil and gas or heavy truck markets  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
results at our merchandising systems business have been and will continue to be affected by employment levels  office occupancy rates and factors affecting vending operator profitability such as fuel  confection and borrowing costs 
we may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our growth depends  in part  on continued sales of existing products  as well as the successful development and introduction of new products  which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  if we are unable to successfully develop  fund and deliver new products for major programs such as the boeing and the airbus am  our operating results would be adversely impacted 
also  any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
further  the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures  increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses 
we also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
the prices of our raw materials may increase  which may adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of certain raw materials that are critical to our profitability are volatile 
this volatility can have a significant impact on our profitability 
in our engineered materials segment  for example  profits could be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs and by inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their position in product cost and functionality against competing materials 
the costs in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments similarly are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel 
while we have taken initiatives aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us  if the prices of critical raw materials increase  our operating costs could be negatively affected 
our ability to obtain parts and raw materials from our suppliers is uncertain  and any disruptions or delays in our supply chain could negatively affect our results of operations 
our operations require significant amounts of important parts and raw materials 
we are engaged in a continuous  company wide effort to concentrate our purchases of parts and raw materials on fewer suppliers  and to obtain parts from suppliers in low cost countries where possible 
as this effort progresses  we are exposed to an increased risk of disruptions to our supply chain  which could have a significant effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to procure these parts or raw materials  our operations may be disrupted  or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations 
we may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions  or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions 
our acquisition program attempts to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities  systems of internal controls and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire 
integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties  including maintenance of uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  distraction of management s attention from normal business operations during the integration process  expenses associated with the integration efforts  and unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process  including legal contingencies 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future  that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable  which could adversely impact our growth rate 
our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 
in addition  changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

table of contents part i item a we face significant competition which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in the future 
while we are a principal competitor in most of our markets  all of our markets are highly competitive 
our competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products  and the ability of our business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions 
competitive pressures  including those discussed above  could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion  either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states and face risks inherent in non domestic operations 
net sales and assets related to our operations outside the united states were and in  and and in  respectively  of our consolidated amounts 
these operations and transactions are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risks of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  adverse trade regulations and possible social  economic and political instability in the countries and regions in which we operate 
we are dependent on key personnel  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business as planned 
certain of our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel  and we generally are dependent upon the continued efforts of key management employees 
we may have difficulty retaining such personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  many of whom are not party to employment agreements with us  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business  which could impact our results of operations in a materially adverse manner 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods  however  if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 
specific risks relating to our business segments aerospace electronics a significant decrease in demand for air travel or a decline in airline profitability generally could result in reduced aircraft orders and could also cause the airlines to scale back on more of their purchases of repair parts from our businesses 
our businesses could also be impacted if major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented approximately of the segment s revenue in and  encounter production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers causes the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
sales and profits could face erosion if pricing pressure from the competitors increased  if planned new products were delayed  if finding new aerospace qualified suppliers grew more difficult  or if required technical personnel became harder to hire and retain 
our aerospace electronics segment results could be below expectations if the us economy slows  which could cause customers to delay or cancel spare parts or aircraft orders 
a portion of this segment s business is conducted under us government contracts and subcontracts 
these contracts are either competitively bid or sole source contracts 
competitively bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers 
sole source contracts are awarded when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
a reduction in congressional appropriations that affect defense spending or the ability of the us government to terminate our contracts could impact the performance of this business 
engineered materials in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could fall if there were a decline in demand for truck trailers  recreational vehicles rvs  industrial or building products for which our businesses produce fiberglass reinforced panels 
we experienced a sharp decline in rv orders about midway through the third quarter of as the rv industry sharply curtailed production in response to a fall off in demand from their customers 
this unfavorable trend continued through the industry generally attributes this downturn to higher gas prices and interest rates and an inventory reduction on dealer lots 
while the short term is uncertain  in the longer term the demographic fundamentals continue to be positive for the growth of rv sales 
profits could also be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs  by the loss of a principal supplier or by any inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their product cost and functionality advantages when compared to competing materials 
we are defending two separate lawsuits brought by customers alleging failure of our fiberglass reinforced plastic material in rv sidewalls manufactured by such customers 
the aggregate damages sought in these two lawsuits are approximately million in direct costs allegedly incurred by the plaintiffs  as well as other consequential losses allegedly suffered 
one of these lawsuits is currently in trial  and is expected to conclude by the end of february the other is nearing completion of fact and expert discovery and a trial on that lawsuit is expected to take place in late we continue to believe that we have valid defenses to the claims raised in both of these lawsuits 
we have given notice of these lawsuits to our insurance carriers and will seek coverage for any liability in accordance with the applicable policies 

table of contents part i item b we are also defending a series of five separate lawsuits  which have now been consolidated  revolving around a fire that occurred in may  at a chicken processing plant located near atlanta  georgia that destroyed the plant 
the aggregate damages demanded by the plaintiff are in excess of million 
these lawsuits contend that certain fiberglass reinforced plastic material manufactured by us that was installed inside the plant was unsafe in that it acted as an accelerant  causing the fire to spread rapidly  resulting in the total loss of the plant and property 
the suits are in the early stages of pre trial discovery and we believe that we have valid defenses to the underlying claims raised in these lawsuits 
we have given notice of these lawsuits to our insurance carriers  and will seek coverage for any resulting losses 
based on our review of coverage  however  we have determined that we are facing a potential million gap in insurance coverage  for the layer of insurance which would have provided protection for losses above million but below million 
we have initiated certain actions aimed at closing the gap in insurance coverage 
if the plaintiffs in these lawsuits were to prevail at trial and be awarded the full extent of their claimed damages  and the gap in coverage was not closed  the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods affected 
merchandising systems results at our businesses could be reduced by unfavorable economic conditions  including inflation and continued increases in fuel costs  delays in launching or supplying new products or an inability to achieve new product sales objectives  as well unfavorable changes in gaming regulations 
results at our foreign locations have been and will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro  other european currencies and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we made four acquisitions in our merchandising systems segment in  two of which are in vending machine manufacturing and two of which manufacture payment systems 
the results of this segment could be adversely affected if unexpected problems are experienced in the integration of these businesses 
in addition  one of the acquired vending machine manufacturers is currently experiencing operating losses  and we anticipate that it will take a number of months to implement the necessary changes to business practices of the acquired company in order to return it to profitability 
fluid handling our businesses could face increased price competition from larger competitors 
slowing of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are cancelled or delayed 
furthermore  as we continue to outsource from international sources  particularly china and other low cost countries  the risk of supply chain issues increases 
at our foreign operations  reported results in us dollar terms could be eroded by an unanticipated weakening of currency of the respective operations 
controls a number of factors could affect our controls segment s results 
lower sales and earnings could result if our businesses cannot maintain their cost competitiveness  encounter delays in introducing new products or fail to achieve their new product sales objectives 
results could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the industrial machinery  oil and gas or heavy equipment industries  or from unforeseen product obsolescence

table of contents part ii item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products 
our business consists of five segments aerospace electronics  engineered materials  merchandising systems  fluid handling and controls 
our primary markets are aerospace  defense electronics  recreational vehicle  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil  gas and power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
during  we completed two acquisitions at a total cost of approximately million 
in september  we acquired the composite panel business of owens corning  which produces  among other products  high gloss fiberglass reinforced plastic panels used in the manufacture of recreational vehicles 
in august  we acquired the mobile rugged business of kontron america  inc  which produces computers  electronics and flat panel displays for harsh environment applications 
in december  together with our partner  emerson electric co  we sold the industrial motion control  llc imc joint venture  generating proceeds to us of million 
our investment in imc was approximately million and we recorded dividend income in  and of million  million and million  respectively 
items affecting comparability of reported results the comparability of our operating results for the years ended december   and is affected by the following significant items asbestos charge with the assistance of outside experts  during the third quarter of  we updated and extended our estimate of our asbestos liability  including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through our previous estimate was for asbestos claims filed through as a result of this updated estimate  we recorded an additional pre tax provision of million during the third quarter of this amount includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
our decision to take this action was based on several factors  including the number of asbestos claims being filed against us has moderated substantially over the past several years  and in our opinion  the outlook for asbestos claims expected to be filed and resolved in the forecast period should be reasonably stable  the stable outlook for future claims is particularly true for mesothelioma claims  which although constituting only of our asbestos claims account for approximately of our aggregate settlement and defense costs over the past five years  federal legislation that would significantly change the nature of asbestos litigation failed to pass in  and in our opinion  the prospects for such legislation at the federal level are remote  there have been significant actions taken by certain state legislatures and courts over the past several years that have reduced the number and types of claims that can proceed to trial  which has been a significant factor in stabilizing the asbestos claim activity  and we have now entered into coverage in place agreements with a majority of our excess insurers  which enables us to project a more stable relationship between settlement and defense costs paid by us and reimbursements from our insurers 
taking all of these factors into account  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos liability for pending claims and future claims to be filed through while it is probable that we will incur additional charges for asbestos liabilities and defense costs in excess of the amounts currently provided  we do not believe that any such amount can be reasonably estimated beyond accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be incurred for claims made subsequent to the liability was  million as of december  environmental charge for environmental matters  we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated 
generally  third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs 
the environmental remediation liability at december  is substantially all for the former manufacturing site in goodyear  arizona the site discussed below 
the site was operated by unidynamics phoenix  inc upi  which became an indirect subsidiary of ours in when we acquired upi s parent company  unidynamics corporation 
upi manufactured explosive and pyrotechnic compounds  including components for critical military programs  for the us government at the site from to  under contracts with the department of defense and other government agencies and certain of their prime contractors 
no manufacturing operations have been conducted at the site since the site was placed on the national priorities list in  and is now part of the phoenix goodyear airport north superfund site 
in  the us environmental protection agency epa issued administrative orders requiring upi to design and carry out certain remedial actions  which upi has done 
groundwater extraction and treatment systems have been in operation at the site since a soil vapor extraction system was in operation from to  was restarted in  and is currently in operation 
on july   we entered into a consent decree with the epa with respect to the site providing for  among other things  a work plan for further investigation and remediation activities at the site 
we recorded a liability in for estimated costs through after reaching substantial agreement on the scope of work with the epa 
at the end of september  the liability totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of  we and our technical advisors determined that changing groundwater flow rates and contaminant plume direction at the site required additional extraction systems as well as modifications and upgrades of the existing systems 
in consultation with our technical advisors  we prepared a forecast of the expenditures required for these new and upgraded systems as well as the costs of operation over the forecast period through taking these additional costs into consideration  our estimated liability for the costs of such activities through was million as of december   which is included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on july   we entered into a consent decree with the us department of justice doj on behalf of the department of defense and the department of energy pursuant to which  among other things  the us government reimburses us for percent of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the site 
as of december   we have recorded a receivable of million for the expected reimbursements from the us government in respect of the aggregate liability as at that date 
foundry restructuring during the fourth quarter of  our fluid handling segment commenced implementation of a restructuring program designed to further enhance operating margins 
the planned actions include ceasing the manufacture of malleable iron and bronze fittings at foundry operating facilities in the uk and canada  respectively  and exiting both facilities and transferring production to china the foundry restructuring 
the foundry restructuring is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the program primarily includes workforce reduction expenses and facility exit costs  all of which are expected to be cash costs 
we expect to incur total pre tax charges  upon program completion  of approximately million 
included in this amount  in december  we recognized workforce reduction charges of approximately million 
also in december  pursuant to this program  we sold our foundry facility in the uk  generating a pre tax gain of approximately million 
we are leasing back part of the property for up to two years until the ongoing manufacturing and office activities are transferred 
civil false claims settlement during the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government 
we were engaged in discussions with attorneys from the civil division of the department of justice doj for over a year regarding allegations that certain valves sold by our crane valves north america unit cvna to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies did not conform to contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
the doj s allegations originated with a qui tam complaint filed under seal by a former cvna employee 
the doj ultimately intervened in that case  and on march   filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas seeking unspecified damages for violations of the false claims act  and other common law claims 
the complaint alleged that cvna failed to notify the correct us military agency when our manufacturing location for mil spec valves listed on the qualified products list was moved from long beach  california to conroe  texas in as a result  the complaint alleged that the valves manufactured in texas were not properly listed on the qualified product list as required by the contract specifications 
we received a letter from the department of the navy on february   conveying the navy s concerns about the qualified products list allegations raised by the doj 
the department of the navy advised us that  if true  these allegations could potentially result in us and our subsidiaries and affiliates being suspended and or debarred from doing business with the us government 
we cooperated with the government s investigation of these matters and executed a settlement agreement with the doj providing for  among other things  the payment of million to the united states and  to pay the legal fees of the former employee who filed the qui tam complaint 
in addition  we negotiated an administrative agreement with the department of the navy for a term of three years pursuant to which we will implement certain changes to our compliance programs and report to the navy on a quarterly basis 
these agreements were executed and became effective on july  we acknowledged the failure to notify the navy and update the qualified products list but we denied that this omission violated the false claims act 
the failure to notify the navy was unintentional and there was no misconduct by our personnel 
we determined to settle this matter to avoid the risks of costly and protracted legal proceedings 
repatriation of foreign earnings during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that our capital balances overseas were in excess of our projected future needs outside the us as a result  we established a million deferred tax liability related to the estimated additional us federal and state income taxes due upon the ultimate repatriation of million of such capital balances

total segment operating profit was million  or higher  in when compared to total fluid handling segment operating profit was million higher  or  in compared to the prior year 
as a percent of sales  total segment operating margins increased to in  compared to in the increase over the prior year was driven primarily by improvement in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments 
fluid handling benefited from successfully leveraging higher sales volume  price increases  the net gain of million related to the consolidation of foundry operations  and the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
merchandising systems benefited from continued strong global demand for payment solutions products and  to a lesser extent operating efficiencies gained through the integration of the ap and dixie narco acquisitions and share gains in european vending 
engineered materials benefited from the full year profit contribution from the september noble acquisition and customer price increases 
these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable operating margins in our aerospace electronics segment due primarily to increased engineering expenses related to new products for major programs such as the boeing and the airbus am

sales of interior scuff and liner panels for transportation trailers increased slightly in compared with sales in latin america and asia were higher in than from strong demand for truck bodies and containers along with building products 
the operating profit decline was primarily due to the lower rv volume  customer assistance costs associated with rv panel distortion and slightly higher material costs partly offset by profit contribution from the september noble acquisition and customer price increases across all product lines 
in  product support has been provided to several rv customers experiencing panel distortion 
distortion affects the exterior panels of rvs and has been caused  in our view  by either a poor gluing process of the fiberglass reinforced plastic frp panels to the substrate material and or a higher than normal moisture content in the substrate materials  which is typically a plywood type material called luan 
crane composites embarked on a customer assistance program to team with the oems to provide solutions to the industry wide distortion problem 
the root causes and actions to address these issues involve teams of our production people and technical experts along with our customers who are reviewing production methods including adhesive processes  substrate sources and inspection processes

aerospace electronics 
for  we expect this segment to show a modest increase in sales and a slight improvement in overall segment margins 
the continued strong demand for commercial aircraft from another record year of aircraft build rates  in both the large commercial and business jet markets  coupled with higher levels of aftermarket sales from modernization and upgrade programs and traditional commercial spares are expected to drive both revenue growth and margin improvement for the aerospace group in however  engineering expenses  primarily related to the continuing development of new products for major oem programs such as the boeing and airbus am  are expected to adversely impact margins throughout  particularly 
table of contents part ii item in the first half of the year

engineered materials 
our engineered materials segment sales are expected to increase in primarily from the full year impact of the composite panel business acquired in september however  declines of approximately to in virtually all markets are anticipated in longer term  business fundamentals continue to be positive for these markets due to continued displacement of traditional materials by frp 
continued execution on the noble expansion and the integration of the composite panel business that we acquired from owens corning is expected to contribute to operating performance in  as well as continued focus on gaining rv market share through targeted product initiatives 
in addition  we anticipate continuing lower levels of customer assistance costs and our pricing strategy is expected to offset anticipated increases in raw materials 
merchandising systems 
in  the base vending industry is forecasting negative growth of

fluid handling 
demand for most of fluid handling s industrial products  which is mainly driven by the chemical and pharmaceutical  oil  gas and power  nuclear  building services and utilities end markets  remained strong during the last three years 
refineries increased spending in both and to keep up with the demand for gasoline 
refineries have been running at full capacity without planned shutdowns  resulting in a higher project to mro maintenance  repair and overhaul mix and a build up of a future shutdown maintenance opportunity 
product demand from alternative fuel markets remains high  partly due to incentives to reduce us dependence on foreign oil and state legislation to replace certain fuel additives with ethanol 
we expect increased sales and operating profit in from continued global market expansion  coupled with operating improvements and efficiencies expected from the benefits of the improved productivity and cost structure of the valve group reorganization as well as the continuation of disciplined pricing  operational excellence and expanded low cost sourcing at all of the fluid handling businesses  such as those expected from the foundry restructuring

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  our operating philosophy is to use cash provided from operating activities to provide value to shareholders by paying dividends and or repurchasing shares  by reinvesting in existing businesses and by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses 
we believe that funds generated by operations and funds available under current or new credit facilities will be sufficient to finance short and long term capital requirements  as well as fund cash payments associated with our asbestos and environmental exposures 
we updated and extended the estimate of our net asbestos liability and recorded an additional provision of approximately million during the third quarter of this provision was based on the total liability to cover the estimated cost of asbestos claims currently pending and to be subsequently asserted through similarly  during the fourth quarter of  we updated our estimate of environmental remediation costs projected through related to our superfund site in goodyear  arizona  and recorded an additional provision of approximately million 
although these increases did not have an immediate impact on our liquidity  both provisions represent the incremental estimate of future cash payments associated with such exposures 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily from improved operating results  coupled with a net asbestos payment in of approximately million compared to million of net asbestos payments in the net asbestos payment in included the following receipt of million in january representing the final payment from equitas in connection with our agreement to settle insurance coverage claims against certain underwriters at lloyd s of london reinsured by equitas

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to a contractually committed off balance sheet chattel paper financing facility that enables our crane merchandising systems cms business to offer various sales support financing programs to our customers 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
recourse to crane co 
for all uncollectible loans made to cms customers by the banks under this agreement is limited to of the outstanding balance per year 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose off balance sheet financing entities 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and  therefore  are critical to understanding our results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recorded when a product is shipped  title risk of loss passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue on long term  fixed price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
sales under cost reimbursement type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
accounts receivable we continually monitor collections from customers  and in addition to providing an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a customer s financial condition  we provide a provision for estimated credit losses when customer accounts exceed days past due 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on these overdue accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was approximately million 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years 
as actual future demand or market conditions vary from those projected by us  adjustments will be required 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets for continued appropriateness as circumstances warrant 
these reviews are based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were necessary for the three years ended december  while we believe these estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year s in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives  as required 
if the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the fair value for purposes of testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
no impairment charges have been required during  or contingencies the categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability  the amount of our liability accruals  and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies 
please refer to note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans in the us  we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately of all us employees 
the benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis  except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service 
this plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for federal or other income tax purposes 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
a number of our non us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately of all non us employees 
the benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation 
these plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by 
table of contents part ii item a independent actuaries 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for tax purposes or mandated by local statutory requirements 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
the net periodic pension cost was million in  million in and million in employer cash contributions were million in  million in and million in we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of approximately million to our pension plans in cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 
for the pension plan  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return of plan assets by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for non us pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for non us pension plans 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
the following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated pension benefits december  benefit obligations us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase net periodic cost us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase in developing the long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices 
the discount rate we used for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations 
postretirement benefits other than pensions we and certain of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to current and former employees  hired before january   who meet minimum age and years of service requirements 
we do not pre fund these benefits and retain the right to modify or terminate the plans 
we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of million to our postretirement benefit plans in the weighted average discount rates assumed to determine postretirement benefit obligations were  and for  and  respectively 
the health care cost trend rates assumed were  and for  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposures to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
total debt outstanding of million at december   was generally at fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
following is an analysis of the potential changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates based upon sensitivity analysis that models effects of shifts in rates 
these are not forecasts 
our year end portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate debt  therefore  the effect of a market change in interest rates would not be significant 
if  on january   currency exchange rates were to decline against the us dollar and the decline remained in place for  based on our year end portfolio  net income would not be materially impacted
