item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer sort and test on the semiconductor die  or chips  on the whole semiconductor wafer  prior to singulation of the wafer into individual chips 
during wafer sort and test  a wafer probe card is mounted in a prober  which is in turn connected to a semiconductor tester  and the wafer probe card is used as an interface to connect electronically with and test individual chips on a wafer 
our wafer probe cards are used by our customers in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process  as are our parametric or in line probe cards 
we work closely with our customers to design  develop and manufacture custom wafer probe cards 
each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
at the core of our product offering are our proprietary technologies  including our microspring interconnect technology and design processes 
our microspring interconnect technology includes a resilient contact element manufactured at our production facilities in livermore  california 
we operate in a single industry segment and have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our microspring interconnect technology 
we were formed in and in introduced our first commercial product 
during  we introduced the industry s first memory wafer probe card capable of testing up to devices in parallel 
in fiscal  we achieved a number of product milestones  including the introduction of our truescale probe cards for testing wire bond logic and system on chip devices for mobile consumer and automotive applications  and the delivery of our first mm  one touchdown wafer level burn in probe cards incorporating our harmony architecture for testing dram devices 
we also made progress toward achieving efficient volume production for our harmony architecture based products  reduced lead times and delivered certain harmony based products for testing dram devices to some of our customers  which are being used in commercial volume 
our revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal  we benefited from semiconductor manufacturers strong demand for our advanced wafer test products as global semiconductor device production increased 
overall  our revenue grew for our products that address the dram market  driven primarily by the continued ramp of nanometer technology nodes at our dram customers  as well as our customers transition to one gigabit ddr devices 
additionally  applications such as mobile ram and graphic ram contributed to our dram revenue growth 
strong demand from existing customers fueled both nor and nand flash growth 
for kgd devices  we saw higher adoption of our hftap product largely driven by the demand for mobile devices  such as nor  specialty nand  mobile ram and psram for at speed testing 
demand for our wafer level burn in products grew as customers moved more burn in of their devices to the wafer level 
revenues for our products that address the logic market grew as a result of the new technology node transition for area array flip chip microprocessor products and the introduction of our new probe cards for higher parallelism probing of wire bond devices 
our customers operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and are subject to significant fluctuations in the demand for their products 
because of the nature of our customers and our business  our revenue growth is driven in significant part by the number of new semiconductor designs that our customers develop the technology transitions involved in these designs and our customers production volumes 
in the past  this has resulted in our being subject to demand fluctuations that have resulted in significant variations of revenues  expenses and results of operations in the periods presented 
we expect these fluctuations and the resulting variations in our financial results  to continue in future periods 
we completed fiscal with fourth quarter revenues decreasing to million when compared to the third quarter of fiscal the slower fourth quarter was largely due to deteriorating semiconductor market conditions  particularly in the dram market 
we expect the deteriorating market conditions for our semiconductor customers to continue in fiscal with  for example  dram semiconductor revenue declining significantly due to the protracted oversupply  and some of our dram customers delaying probe card purchases 
in addition  while we have successfully qualified and delivered certain harmony architecture based wafer probe cards that are being used by some of our customers in commercial volume for testing semiconductor devices and reduced manufacturing lead times  we are continuing to experience the effects of the new product execution challenges for our harmony based products that we experienced in fiscal  which have contributed to a more difficult competitive environment 
to better align our company with the market environment  we announced on february  our commitment to implement a cost reduction plan that will include reducing our global workforce by approximately 
the majority of our sales are directly to semiconductor manufacturers 
in fiscal  sales to four customers accounted for of our revenues 
because the semiconductor industry is a relatively concentrated industry  we believe that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our business 
we generally have limited backlog and therefore we rely upon orders that are booked and shipped in the same quarter for about half of our revenues 
our backlog was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we manufacture our wafer probe cards based on order backlog and customer commitments 
in addition  due to our customers short delivery time requirements  we at times produce our products in anticipation of demand for our products 
backlog includes only orders for which written authorizations have been accepted  shipment dates within months have been assigned and revenue has not been recognized 
in addition  backlog includes service revenue for existing product service agreements to be earned within the next months 
in addition to direct sales we also had sales to our distributor in prior years 
sales to our distributor were  and of our revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
currently  we have one distributor  spirox corporation  which serves singapore  philippines  malaysia and the people s republic of china 
we also have the ability to sell our products directly to customers in these regions 
prior to october  we sold our products in taiwan through spirox 
in october  we transitioned to a direct sales and service model in taiwan 
management focuses on various external measures that impact our performance  including for example  semiconductor manufacturer technology transitions  semiconductor manufacturing wafer fabrication facility expansions  semiconductor device architecture changes and implementations  and new market developments 
we believe the following information is key to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
fiscal years ended december  and december  had weeks each 
the fiscal year ended december  had weeks 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
revenues from our customers are subject to quarterly  annual and other fluctuations due to design cycles  technology adoption rates and cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll and manufacturing related overhead 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes costs related to the start up of our new manufacturing facility  which was completed in early and costs of the expansion of our manufacturing facility which was completed in our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions or write offs of inventory as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell a fully custom product into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolete and non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write down would be required 
once established  the original cost of our inventory less the related inventory valuation adjustments represents the new cost basis of such products 
reversal of these write downs is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development activities to develop new technologies for current and new markets and new applications in the future 
we expect these expenses to scale with revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  and administrative activities 
these expenses also include costs for enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
we expect that selling expenses will increase as revenues increase and we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to support future revenue growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful receivables  inventories  marketable securities  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies  litigation and accrual for other liabilities 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are recognized upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of sale 
although our distributor has no price protection rights or rights to return product  other than for warranty claims  we defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenues  on a gross basis  from our distributor until our distributor confirms an order from our customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value using the residual method 
we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting 
we offer product maintenance and repair arrangements to our customers 
amounts due from our customers under these arrangements are initially recorded as deferred revenues 
the fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period and related costs are recorded as incurred 
revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have been insignificant to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
warranty accrual 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
inventory valuation 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record adjustments to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolescence or non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
inventory write downs once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we adopted fin on december   the first day of the first quarter of fiscal fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that results in a tax benefit 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  statement of operations classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  our tax assets and liabilities did not differ from the assets and liabilities before adoption  therefore  we did not record any adjustments as of the adoption date 
in addition  consistent with the provisions of fin  we reclassified million of income tax liabilities from current to non current liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
at the adoption date of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefit of which million net of the federal impact on state benefit of unrecognized tax benefits would impact our effective tax rate if recognized 
see note income taxes  for additional information 
we continue to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our estimates of income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
while management has considered taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in additional income tax expense in such period 
given our increasing levels of profitability  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize all of our domestic deferred tax assets 
for the deferred tax asset resulting from foreign net operating losses we have concluded that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be utilized and therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
differences between our tax provision and tax return may occur and such adjustments are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we implemented sfas r with regard to equity based compensation 
as such  we began accounting for stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan espp under sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires us to make assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool to determine if there are any tax shortfalls which require recognition in the condensed consolidated income statements 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
under apb opinion no 
 sfas and sfas r  the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r

additionally applications such as mobile ram and graphic ram contributed to our dram revenue growth 
the increase in dram revenues was offset by a seasonal weakness in the mobile dram business due to decreased demand for mobile and consumer applications 
in the fourth quarter  the increase in dram revenues was also offset in part due to early execution issues with our harmony architecture based dram products 
approximately of our dram revenues for fiscal were derived from nanometer and below technology products compared to for fiscal revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased mainly due to increased demand for our nor flash wafer probe cards by a significant customer whose high volume ramp resulted from the growing demand for consumer applications which utilize multi chip packages 
revenues generated from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also increased for our nand flash wafer probe cards 
consumer applications which utilize multi chip packages were a major driver for both categories of flash devices 
semiconductors that are integrated into multi chip packages often benefit from increased wafer level testing to validate device performance before packaging 
revenues from manufacturers of logic devices increased primarily due to the new technology node transition for area array flip chip microprocessor products and existing and key customers engagements for our truescale applications in the mobile communications  digital consumer  and automotive controller markets 
revenue by geographic region fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands north america   europe   japan   asia pacific   total revenues   geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we send the customer invoices 
for example  certain korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries and accordingly  revenues derived from sales to such customers are reflected in north america revenues 
the decrease in revenues in north america was due primarily to decreased sales related to product transitions combined with decreased customer demand resulting from new product delays 
the increase in the percentage of revenues in japan was primarily due to increased demand from one customer as a result of a major nanometer and gb tooling cycle 
the increase in percentage of revenues in asia pacific was primarily due to growth in our business with taiwan and korean customers and strong demand related to nanometer and gb transitions 
revenues in europe were primarily flat year over year as a percent of total revenue 
gross margin fiscal fiscal in thousands gross margin   of revenues the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to higher revenues combined with improved factory productivity  cost reductions and lower charges for inventory reserves which in turn improved gross margin percentage 
these improvements were partially offset by higher warranty expense associated with the introduction of a new product technology and in the fourth quarter  by lower production levels 
excess custom probe card inventory write downs decreased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal due to cycle time reductions  increase in yields and improvement in our order fulfillment process 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon for us as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  which requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
gross margin for fiscal includes additional stock based compensation expense of million  or of revenue  compared to  million  or of revenue for fiscal  due to the adoption of fas r in the first quarter of fiscal research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development   of revenues research and development expenses increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel  new technology  product development related costs and facility expansion 
personnel costs increased million due to increased headcount while expenses related to new technology and product development increased million 
facilities related costs and depreciation increased million due to new investment in r d equipment and facilities expansion at our livermore facilities while stock based compensation remained fairly consistent for the same periods 
we are continuing the development of our next generation parallelism architecture and products  fine pitch memory and logic products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we are also making incremental investments in new technologies and products as we focus on new market opportunities

personnel costs increased million primarily due to increased headcount while facilities related costs and depreciation increased million for fiscal legal and other professional incurred for protecting our intellectual property portfolio  tax and accounting services  and other expenses increased million 
in addition  stock based compensation expense also increased million primarily due to increased headcount and the one time modification charge of million  incurred during the first quarter of fiscal resulting from the accelerated vesting of unvested stock options and restricted stock units in conjunction with the severance agreement of our company s former president 
interest and other income expense  net fiscal fiscal in thousands interest income expense   of revenues other income expense  net of revenues the increase in interest income was due to larger cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances throughout fiscal compared to fiscal while yields remained relatively flat 
cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities increased to million at december  compared to million at december  other income for both fiscal and was mainly comprised of foreign currency gains  primarily related to japanese yen  and other expense 
provision for income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands provision for income taxes   effective tax rate our effective income tax rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal the fiscal provision was impacted by tax charges related to our plan to align the structure of our worldwide affiliates with the geographic mix of our customers 
to effect this alignment  we initiated the first phase of our current plan to establish operations in singapore to provide operational and financial services to the region 
a significant element of the new structure involves the sharing of certain expenses related to the ongoing development of intangible property 
tax charges to implement the new structure impacted the fiscal effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
these charges consisted primarily of royalty prepayments associated with the buy in for our transfer of intellectual property to singapore that will be taxed in the u 
s 
and the loss of certain us tax deductions related to research and development and certain other administration expenses 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be in the mid range in fiscal and  and possibly a lower rate in future years  as we begins to realize operational and tax efficiencies resulting from this alignment plan

dso at december  was days 
cash flows used for increase in inventories were million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in inventories in fiscal is the result of an increase in raw materials primarily for the roll out of a new product line 
the increases in fiscal and fiscal resulted from increased volume in business and strong demand for our products 
net inventory turns were   and in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
other assets increased million for fiscal compared to an increase of million for fiscal the increase resulted from a prepayment of approximately million for our year prepaid land lease offer related to our singapore manufacturing facility expansion 
the land lease is classified as an operating lease and the prepayment of approximately million is amortized over the term of the land lease 
cash flows used for a decrease in accrued liabilities were million for fiscal compared to cash flow provided by an increase of million for fiscal and an increase of million for fiscal the fiscal cash flows used were primarily due to lower bonus and profit sharing accruals resulting from a mid year payout 
the fiscal and cash flows provided were due primarily to increased accrued compensation and benefit related expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal we invested in the capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and service centers  our expansion into singapore  leasehold improvements to our livermore headquarters  information technology system upgrades  and new product technology 
in addition  the increase in purchases and decrease in sales and maturities of marketable securities contributed to net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  million in proceeds from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and million in tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was mainly due to million of net proceeds received from an equity follow on offering completed in march as well as proceeds of million received from the exercise of employee stock options and million received from espp purchases 
tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options for fiscal were million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was mainly due to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
upon the adoption of sfas r commencing in fiscal excess tax benefits from stock options is classified as a financing activity where as in it was included in cashflow from operating activities 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due in after total in thousands operating leases      inventory purchase obligations   total      the table above excludes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million as of december  and are classified as deferred and other long term tax liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement period for our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  it is not expected to be due within the next twelve months 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the cost of increasing manufacturing capacity to meet projected demand  including our current global expansion plans and the requirements of any potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies that we may enter into in the future

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion  but not all  of existing foreign currency denominated amounts 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company recognized net gain of million for the year ended december   from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts in our financial statements under other expense 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes  municipal bonds and notes and money market funds 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer  except us treasuries and us agencies 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in  our as reported interest income would have declined approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels
