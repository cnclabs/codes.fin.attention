included in eliminations corporate are the eliminations among the five segments  as well as certain general and corporate expenses that have not been allocated to the segments 
overview was another year of solid performance for terex  as we continued to benefit from global economic growth driving strong end market demand 
we focused on numerous internal initiatives to grow sales and profitability as we transform from a holding company to an integrated operating company 
we have also benefited from global growth driven by strong economies in north america and western europe and improving standards of living around the world 
although we expect slower economic growth in in north america  and to a lesser extent in western europe  our strategy of product and geographic diversity is expected to drive sales growth that will allow us to remain on pace to achieve our goal of billion in sales with a operating margin by demand for infrastructure and energy has resulted in extraordinary demand for our cranes 
strong commodity demand driven by developing economies has increased demand for our mining equipment 
increasing labor rates that require productivity enhancing solutions combined with improving global safety standards is driving demand for our aerial work platforms products 
our construction products faced a mixed year in  with weakness in north america partially offset by strength in other geographies  particularly in western europe  for certain types of heavy equipment  and in both western and eastern europe for compact construction equipment 
our roadbuilding and utility businesses  which are primarily north american focused  remained weak  as a result of continued low levels of governmental spending on infrastructure 
a key to our continued strong performance is that our product portfolio contains a mix of early  mid and late cycle products combined with mining products that are tied to global commodity demand 
for example  compact construction equipment is an early cycle product  aerial work platforms and heavy construction equipment are mid cycle equipment  and cranes and roadbuilding equipment are late cycle equipment 
this relatively balanced mix of product types helps to moderate cyclical sales movements for terex as a whole  as demand for one product may weaken  but be offset by demand for products in a different cycle 
a balanced geographic sales mix also helps moderate demand swings for our products  as demand in one region may strengthen or weaken over different times as compared to economies in other geographies 
events demonstrated the value of geographic diversity  as construction equipment sales slowed in north america but were strong in europe 
in  of our sales were to customers located in the usa  united kingdom and germany 
to further our geographic sales mix  we are intent on growing our presence in developing markets as we work towards our goal of generating approximately of our sales from the americas  from europe  africa and the middle east and the remaining from asia and australia 
global dynamics expected to continue to drive demand for our equipment include creating infrastructure in developing economies  repairing replacing infrastructure in north america and western europe  increasing labor costs and strengthening safety standards globally 
developing economies are building infrastructure at a rapid pace  as demonstrated in countries and regions around the world such as the middle east  and particularly dubai  cities in eastern china such as shanghai and beijing  and eastern europe 
this growth is expected to continue as profits from oil exports are invested by exporting countries such as russia and the middle east and as western chinese cities develop 
decaying infrastructure and historical under investment in infrastructure to support population growth are expected to continue to drive demand for equipment in north america and western europe 
this global infrastructure demand favorably impacts all five of our segments  particularly cranes and materials processing mining 
aerial work platforms and compact construction equipment such as mini excavators are benefiting from higher labor costs that drive demand for productivity enhancing solutions 
stricter safety standards are also driving demand for equipment such as aerial work platforms as countries recognize the inherent risks of working at height on ladders and scaffolding 
we also continued to improve our financial position and long term strategic plans in in january  we completed our previously announced redemption of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due this transaction allowed us to repay high cost debt with cash generated from operations 
in november  we acquired shm  a leading manufacturer of highwall mining equipment 
the total consideration for the transaction was approximately million paid in cash 
we recognized that the softening north american economy combined with credit market concerns offered both a potential opportunity for finding acquisitions but also a challenge for raising capital 
in november  we took pre emptive action by raising approximately million by issuing senior subordinated notes with a coupon of that mature in november the note issuance was undertaken in anticipation of increasing acquisition opportunities for the company as economic trends worsened 
subsequent to year end  we announced the acquisition of asv  which was valued at approximately million 
asv designs and manufactures rubber track loaders and undercarriages 
in december  we increased and extended our share repurchase program by million 
this brings the total dollar amount that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program to million  and extends the program period from its original expiration date of june  through june  during  we repurchased approximately million shares for million 
return on invested capital  or roic  continues to be the unifying metric we use to measure our operating performance 
roic measures how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
in  we achieved an roic of  compared to roic in and our roic target of 
roic is determined by dividing the last four quarters income from operations including operating income from discontinued operations by the average of the sum of total stockholders equity plus debt less cash and cash equivalents for the last five quarters 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters income from operations as this represents the most recent twelve month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarter s ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis over the same time period as the numerator four quarters of average invested capital 
in  we included operating income from discontinued operations in the numerator of our calculation of roic because the roic metric is intended to compare total enterprise operational return to a total enterprise denominator that is based on amounts that include invested capital of discontinued operations in the balances 
we believe that this total enterprise roic calculation  including operating income from discontinued operations  provides a more complete performance metric 
we utilize roic as a unifying metric because we feel that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the full enterprise wide amount of capital invested in our business  as opposed to another metric such as return on shareholder s equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and that roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
consistent with this belief  we use roic in evaluating executive performance and compensation  as we have previously disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders 
the following tables provide roic calculations for and and provide information to reconcile amounts used in our roic calculation that are adjusted for discontinued operations to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap amounts in millions dec sep jun mar dec income from operations debt as defined above less cash and cash equivalents debt less cash and cash equivalents total stockholders equity debt less cash and cash equivalents plus total stockholders equity roic income from operations last quarters average debt less cash and cash equivalents plus total stockholders equity quarters dec sep jun mar dec income from operations plus income from operations of disc

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events which could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
at december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
guarantees we have issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag  part of the cranes segment  and genie  part of the aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  genie s maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december   with our total residual value guarantees issued including genie of million 
we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 and and rescission of fin we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we can expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
in limited circumstances  certain new units may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit  if certain conditions are met by the customer 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with fin no 
the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by fin no 
pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of fin no 
 we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price paid in the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the assets  both tangible and intangible  and liabilities we acquired 
we review the value of our recorded goodwill annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  to determine if this value is potentially impaired 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the estimate also includes a determination of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of goodwill as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims based on our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our director of product safety 
we provide accruals for estimated product liability experience on known claims 
we do not accrue for reported incidents until such time as a claim is made against us 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
pension benefits pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained four qualified defined benefit pension plans and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits for the qualified plan covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
participation in the plan for salaried employees was frozen on or before october  the benefits for the three qualified plans covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation was frozen effective december  for one plan  february  for another plan  and june  for the third plan 
for all four qualified plans  no participants will be credited with service following the effective dates of their freeze  except that participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility only 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plans based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china  netherlands  india and the united kingdom for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france  netherlands  india and china are unfunded plans 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds  and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the uk funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this allocation is reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plan 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed percent of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for us plans and for the us plans at december  these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
while we examine performance and future expectations annually  we also view historic asset portfolios and performance over a long period of years 
in the short term  there may be fluctuations of positive and negative yields year over year  but over the long term  the actual return is expected to match the expected assumptions 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect the recognized pension expense or benefit and our pension obligation in future periods 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to for international plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our international pension plans were to at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily increases in the discount rate  resulted in a net decrease in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of the plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of the plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plan estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liability and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation foreign plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of the company 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because some net operating losses nols expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings will be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take

we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas no

liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
we believe that cash generated from our operations  together with access to our bank credit facilities and our cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  million at december  in addition  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  generating cash from operations depends primarily on our ability to earn net income through sales of our products and manage our investment in working capital 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables in a timely manner 
consistent with past practice  each quarter we sell receivables to various third party financial institutions through several pre arranged facilities 
during the fourth quarter of and  we sold  without recourse  accounts receivable approximating and of our fourth quarter revenue in and  respectively  to provide additional liquidity 
the discontinuance of these facilities could reduce our liquidity 
we are focused on increasing inventory turns by sharing  throughout our company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we continue to experience challenges with supply chain capacities and deliveries 
substantial effort has gone into reviewing and improving our materials planning and forecasting methods  and  despite high current levels of inventory  we are seeing improvements in many areas 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or in used equipment values may impact the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
as our sales increase  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may increase  with a corresponding reduction in cash generated by operations 
we insure and sell a portion of our accounts receivable to third party finance companies that are not obligated to purchase accounts receivable from us  and may choose to limit or discontinue further purchases from us at any time 
changes in customers credit worthiness  in the market for credit insurance or in the willingness of third party finance companies to purchase accounts receivable from us can impact our cash flow from operations 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may impact suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  many of our customers have tended to delay purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these projects 
our sales have become less seasonal as we have grown  diversified our product offerings and expanded the geographic reach of our products  and our sales have become less dependent on construction products and sales in the united states and europe 
in addition  high levels of backlog in a number of our segments have led to longer wait times and deliveries being accepted regardless of the season 
as a result  we expect first and second half sales to be relatively equal in in  our income tax payments increased 
in and  we used net operating losses to reduce our cash income tax payments  most notably in the us  germany and the united kingdom 
the us net operating loss was substantially utilized in  resulting in higher cash payments in the us for increasing profitability in germany resulted in additional utilization of net operating loss carry forwards in germany  partially offsetting the increased cash payments in the us because of the quarterly pattern of our sales  we have recently used cash to fund our operations in the first quarter of the year and generated cash in the remaining three quarters of the year 
in  we used cash in the first quarter and generated cash in the rest of the year 
we expect our cash flow performance in to be heavily influenced by our ability to reduce inventory as a percentage of sales  driven by efficiency improvements and easing of supplier constraints 
we expect our operating cash flow pattern in to be similar or better than to help fund our significant cash expenditures during the first quarter of the year  we have maintained cash balances and a revolving line of credit in addition to term borrowings from our bank group 
our bank credit facilities provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million that is available through july  and term debt of million that will mature on july  the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
the credit facilities also provide for incremental loan commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the lenders  in the form of revolving credit loans  term loans or a combination of both 
our bank credit facilities require compliance with a number of covenants 
these covenants require us to meet certain financial tests  namely a to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not in excess of to on the last day of any fiscal quarter  and b to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the covenants also limit  in certain circumstances  our ability to take a variety of actions  including incur indebtedness  create or maintain liens on our property or assets  make investments  loans and advances  engage in acquisitions  mergers  consolidations and asset sales  and pay dividends and distributions  including share repurchases 
our bank credit facilities also contain customary events of default 
we currently comply with all of our financial covenants under the bank credit facilities 
our future compliance with our financial covenants under the bank credit facilities will depend on our ability to generate earnings and manage our assets effectively 
our bank credit facilities also have various non financial covenants  requiring us to refrain from taking certain actions as described above and requiring us to take certain actions  such as keeping in good standing our corporate existence  maintaining insurance  and providing our bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis 
on january   we redeemed the outstanding million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the total cash paid was million  and included a call premium of  as set forth in the indenture for the notes  plus accrued interest of per  principal amount at the redemption date 
we recorded pre tax charges of million in the first quarter of for the call premium and accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs as a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on november   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are not currently guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries  but under certain limited circumstances could become guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
the notes are redeemable by us beginning in november at an initial redemption price of of principal amount 
the interest rates charged under our bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the revolving credit component under our bank credit facilities was at december  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our revolver at december  the weighted average interest rate on the term loans under the bank credit facilities was and at december  and  respectively 
we have also positioned ourselves to repurchase some of our outstanding common stock as conditions warrant 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares through june  in december  our board of directors increased the share repurchase program by million  bringing the total amount that may be repurchased under the program to million  and extended the expiration date for the program through june  during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares for million under this program 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix without substantially increasing risk 
we anticipate that acquisitions will be a part of our growth strategy  and with the recent volatility in the financial markets  we are positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
we intend to use our liquidity to target acquisitions and fund internal expansion activities  including capital expenditures 
on november   we acquired shm for approximately million 
on january   we announced that we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire asv for approximately million 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to allow for easier access to the capital markets 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facility and senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
cash flows vs 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided resulted from higher working capital  particularly inventory due to the net sales increase  logistics issues related to our increased level of international business  which is causing longer transport times and certain supplier constraints limiting production throughput  which increased our use of cash by million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  or million more than cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of shm for approximately million and million higher capital expenditures in the current year  including costs associated with implementing our enterprise management system 
additionally  in the prior year we had million of proceeds from the sale of a discontinued operation 
we provided cash from financing activities of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million 
the change in financing cash flows was primarily due to the issuance of million of long term debt and repayment of million in long term debt in compared to repayment of million of long term debt in the year ended december   offset by share repurchases in of million 
contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by year total committed thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
we expect to pay approximately million of this liability during due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the pension plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions to the pension plans of million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in we participate in a joint venture arrangement with a european financial institution as described below in off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  may fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigation and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  variable interest entities we own a forty percent interest in the tfsh joint venture 
a european financial institution owns the majority sixty percent interest in tfsh 
as defined by fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 tfsh is a variable interest entity 
based on the legal  financial and operating structure of tfsh  we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of tfsh and that we do not control the operations of tfsh 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the results of tfsh into our consolidated financial statements 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investment in tfsh 
the scope of tfsh s operations includes the opportunity to facilitate the financing of our products sold in certain areas of europe 
as of december   tfsh had total assets of million  consisting primarily of financing receivables and lease related equipment  and total liabilities of million  consisting primarily of debt issued by our joint venture partner 
prior to march   we provided guarantees related to potential losses arising from shortfalls in the residual values of financed equipment or credit defaults by the joint venture s customers 
as of december   the maximum exposure to loss under these guarantees was approximately million 
additionally  we are required to maintain a capital account balance in tfsh  pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  which could result in our reimbursement to tfsh of losses to the extent of our ownership percentage 
because of the capital account balance requirements for tfsh  during the first quarter of  we contributed our proportional share of these requirements  which represented an additional million in cash to tfsh 
sale leaseback transactions our rental business typically rents equipment to customers for periods of no less than three months 
to better match cash outflows in the rental business to cash inflows from customers  we finance the equipment through a series of sale leasebacks  which are classified as operating leases 
the leaseback period is typically months in duration 
at december   the historical cost of equipment being leased back from the financing companies was approximately million and the minimum lease payment in will be approximately million 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies and interest rate risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows or forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below  for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations and guarantees 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
no such incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has required  and will continue to require  us to make expenditures 
we do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note m derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately  million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by an additional to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december   would have had a translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes that would have increased our operating income by approximately million in interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate and libor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pretax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million in commodities risk principal materials that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulic cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
our performance may be impacted by extreme movements in material costs and from availability of these materials 
as our manufacturing volume has increased  our need for these commodities and manufactured items also has increased  which in turn has created pressure on our existing supplier base to deliver us materials on a timely basis and in sufficient amounts when requested 
this supply constraint has been exacerbated as a result of higher global demand for the same materials caused by recovering end markets in our some of product areas and by higher consumption from developing economies such as china 
the inability of suppliers to deliver materials promptly has resulted  and could result  in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
some of the necessary components for which we have experienced supply constraints over the recent past include large off highway tires  steel and steel products  bearings  gear boxes  hydraulic components and various fabricated weldments 
furthermore  as demand for these materials has increased  we have experienced increased costs to obtain these components 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials are normally available from multiple suppliers 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
to deal with some of the recent supply constraints we have experienced  for example  we designed and implemented plans to mitigate their impact by using alternate suppliers  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and costs  and increasing the price of our products 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis 
one key terex business system initiative has been developing and implementing world class capability in supply chain management  logistics and global purchasing 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
