item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth previously under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of diagnostic nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices  hospitals and other medical services providers 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are mobile as well as fixed and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras 
the cameras and accompanying equipment fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital 
we generate revenues within two primary operating segments our dis business and our product sales business 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive mobile imaging services leasing program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera or ultrasound machine for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging  echocardiography  vascular ultrasound or any combination of these procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform imaging in the physician office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis leasing service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
we also offer digitech leases to customers who own one of our nuclear gamma cameras but contract with us to provide staffing and other support services 
dis leasing services are primarily provided to cardiologists and internists 
physicians enter into annual contracts for imaging services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to three times per week 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to summer slowdowns principally relating to vacations  holidays and inclement weather  which have historically impacted the results of our dis operations during our third and fourth quarters 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and other ancillary items  and from our camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals  and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
we do not anticipate that the international market will be a significant source of revenues in the foreseeable future 
our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of approximately  cardiologists   internists and family practitioners  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac and ultrasound procedures 
as of december   we have provided imaging services through dis to over physicians and physician groups 
we have sold cameras through our product segment 
as of december   more than half of our dis nuclear and ultrasound imaging customers are internists or other primary care practitioners  and the remainder are cardiologists 
we believe our market has been negatively affected by declining reimbursements from medicare and medicaid programs  pricing pressures  and continuing efforts by some third party payors to reduce health care expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications  or disallowing reimbursement if imaging is performed with mobile or leased cameras 
we expect each of these trends to continue 
trends and drivers the medical device industry  including the market for nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services  is highly competitive 
our business continues to face the challenge of the decline in demand for nuclear imaging equipment and services  which we believe reflects the impact of the deficit reduction act on the reimbursement environment  as well as competition from new nuclear gamma camera products and competing imaging modalities  such as ct angiography  positron emission tomography and hybrid technologies 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include acceptance by physicians  qualification for reimbursement  pricing  ease of use  reliability and mobility  technical leadership and superiority  and effective marketing and distribution 
in providing dis lease services  we continue to face pressure from the competition to reduce our prices 
we compete against businesses employing traditional vacuum tube cameras  companies that use older digirad cameras or low cost refurbished cameras  and imaging centers that install nuclear gamma cameras and make them available to referring physicians in their geographic vicinity 
to counteract pressures from the competition  we diversified the line of imaging services we offer  penetrated new regions  and launched new marketing efforts  all of which have contributed to our revenue growth in in may  we acquired the net assets of ultrascan  inc ultrascan  see note of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i  item  a mobile ultrasound company with facilities centered around atlanta  georgia  and began offering ultrasound imaging services 
this acquisition allowed our nuclear imaging business to penetrate the southeast market as we have converted one third of ultrascan s pre established customers to nuclear imaging 
furthermore  we have begun to offer ultrasound imaging services at select existing dis locations  and will continue to expand this offering to more locations 
we will continue our interest in strategic acquisitions into we also unveiled our centers of influence program during the centers of influence program is a marketing strategy that affiliates us with highly respected academic medical institutions and physicians 
the established affiliation provides us with a competitive advantage  which we believe will result in the expansion of our customer base and hub locations 
during  our product leadership team began executing on a plan to combine spending reductions  focused engineering efforts and revenue growth to translate into an operating profit for the product segment 
we expect that this initiative will result in further reductions in operating expenses and improvement in our gross margins 
we also plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve the image quality  speed  reliability  cost structure and overall performance of our multi headed cameras and software 
we believe we are starting to see increasing opportunities to sell to larger cardiology practices as they seek to increase productivity with more efficient systems by replacing older equipment 
highlights our consolidated revenues were million during the twelve months ended december   which represented an increase of million  or  over the comparable prior year period due to the increase in revenue at our dis segment 
dis revenue increased by million  or  to million  primarily resulting from ultrasound imaging services which were not sold in the increase in revenue from ultrasound imaging services was offset by the million decrease in revenue resulting from our decision to discontinue the sale of stress agents in in the product business  revenue decreased by million  or  to million due to lower average sales prices of our gamma cameras 
our consolidated net loss in was million  which improved by million from the improvement in our operating results during is primarily attributable to the million decrease in operating expenses  resulting from our targeted spending reduction initiatives 
as of december   dis operated nuclear imaging systems  and ultrasound imaging systems  compared to nuclear imaging systems as of december  these systems were operated in states and the district of columbia 
in connection with our plan to upgrade our dis nuclear camera fleet over the next few years  we placed additional multi headed cameras into our dis business in  bringing the total number of such cameras in the fleet to in  the overall utilization rate for the nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems was  compared to a utilization rate of in utilization refers to the percentage of time that the imaging systems are used to deliver services to dis customers out of the total time that the systems are available to deliver such services 
the increase in units and utilization was primarily attributable to the acquired assets from ultrascan 
in addition  our dis gross margins improved to in compared to in  due primarily to lower pharmaceutical costs  lower depreciation expense and more efficient labor costs 
we continue to obtain additional hub accreditation to respond to the reimbursement requirements of some third party payors 
as of december   we had obtained accreditation from the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of nuclear medicine laboratories for of our dis hub locations requiring accreditation 
we are also in the process of submitting an application to obtain ultrasound imaging accreditation through the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of echocardiography laboratories 
during  we expanded our product portfolio by adding the xpo features to the rest of our cardius family of cameras 
our cardius xpo camera series allows physicians to choose among dual and triple head cameras to accommodate their practices speed and throughput needs  or upgrade to a dual or triple head configuration as their practice grows and changes 
furthermore  we introduced the option of nspeed rapid image acquisition packages in  which offers up to two times greater acquisition efficiency for cardiac spect imaging  the ability to improve clinical quality  reduce the acquisition time in half or to reduce the radiation dosage to patients in half for a typical procedure 
in  our product business delivered gamma cameras compared to in product revenue decreased as compared to the prior year period by million resulting from reduced average selling prices due to continuing competitive pricing pressures 
product gross margins improved to in compared to in  primarily as a result of lower material  labor and overhead expenses and improved manufacturing yields

consolidated revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over  primarily as a result of higher dis revenues attributable to the introduction of ultrasound imaging services 
dis revenue accounted for of total revenues for  compared to for we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of the ultrasound imaging services revenue generated from the assets recently acquired from ultrascan 
this increase was partially offset by our decision to discontinue the sale of stress agents  which contributed to million in revenue in and did not contribute to any revenue in we anticipate that our dis revenue will increase as we expand into new markets and continue to penetrate existing markets 
such growth will fluctuate  however  based on seasonality stemming from physician vacations  holidays  inclement weather  and start up time required by sales representatives as we enter new geographical areas 
product 
our product revenue was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in product revenue is attributable to a decline in the average selling prices for our gamma cameras  partially offset by increasing maintenance contract revenues 
we continue to experience pricing pressures on our gamma cameras and we expect this pricing pressure to continue 
gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  representing an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in consolidated gross profit was principally generated from ultrasound imaging services 
the increase was also the result of our efforts to improve operational efficiencies  as well as lower material and supply costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for dis 
cost of dis revenue consists primarily of labor  equipment depreciation and other costs associated with the provision of services 
cost of dis revenue increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year  primarily generated from ultrasound imaging services  and offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs associated with our decision to discontinue the sale of stress agents 
historically  the pharmaceutical costs approximated their sales value  resulting in almost no profit on these sales 
dis gross profit increased to million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for product 
cost of revenues primarily consists of materials  labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
warranty costs are charged to cost of revenues in the period our cameras are sold and are based on our historical experience with failure rates and repair costs 
cost of goods sold was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
product gross profit increased to million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for product margin improvement is due to a reduction in material costs and an improvement in operating efficiency gained from increased camera volumes as units were manufactured and placed into dis as part of our dis camera fleet upgrade program 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
the primary costs are salaries and fringe benefits  development material costs  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees and nonrecurring engineering costs 
research and development expenses were million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average number of research personnel from to people and decreased spending on indirect materials associated with new product development 
research and development expenses were of product revenue for compared to for our research and development efforts occur principally within our products segment 
in the future  we expect to continue to invest in research and development as we innovate and seek to continue to improve our existing technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  travel  marketing  and collateral materials and tradeshow costs 
sales and marketing expenses were million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to a reduction in outside service costs and stock compensation  which decreased by million from the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue for compared to for we expect to increase our sales and marketing efforts  principally in our dis business  as we expand into new geographies and launch a marketing program for echocardiography and vascular ultrasound 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance and accounting  human resources and other personnel  as well as legal and other professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses were million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year as a result of lower personnel related expenses  legal and recruiting costs and a reduction in spending on outside services 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for compared to for other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of interest and other expenses 
the decrease in other income reflects the lower levels of average cash and investments balances in compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of ultrascan s net assets 
net loss our net loss was million for compared million for  primarily as a result of the factors described above 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenues were million in  which represents an increase of million  or over the prior year  primarily as a result of delivering more cameras in as compared to and an increase in camera service and maintenance contract revenue 
dis and product revenue accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues for  compared to and  respectively  for dis 
our dis revenue decreased to million for  which represents a decline of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in dis revenue resulted primarily from phasing out the delivery of stress agents to the majority of our dis customers in june stress agent revenue was million in compared to million in product 
our product revenue was million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the increase in product revenue is due to selling cameras in compared to in  resulting in million of additional revenues  and an increase in camera service and maintenance contract revenues of nearly million 
maintenance contract revenues were million in compared to million in gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  representing an increase of million or  compared to the increase in consolidated gross profit is principally due to the improved performance of our product segment in as compared to consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in dis 
cost of dis revenue was million in  representing an increase of million  or  over  primarily resulting from the additional personnel costs of employees previously categorized in general and administrative expenses whose duties have been shifted towards operations

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in  an increase of million  or  over this was primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development  including a mobile version of our cardius xpo triple head camera and our software development initiatives 
research and development related stock based compensation costs  including those associated with the adoption of sfas r  were million during research and development expenses were of total revenues for versus for sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  an increase of million  or  over  primarily as a result of an increase in personnel costs of million 
sales and marketing related stock based compensation costs  including those associated with the adoption of sfas r  were million during  which was million higher than the stock based compensation costs recorded in sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over stock based compensation costs  including those associated with the adoption of sfas r  were million during  which was million higher than the stock based compensation costs recorded in the general and administrative expenses were of total revenue in compared to in stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas  shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption 
the fair value of options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method under sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  in accounting for our equity plans 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
those amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to cost of revenues and operations over the vesting period of the options 
the adoption of sfas r in resulted in the recognition of total stock based compensation expense of million in of this amount  approximately million is included in cost of sales  million is included in research and development expenses  million is included in selling and marketing expenses and million is included in general and administrative expenses 
total unrecognized stock based compensation costs related to nonvested stock and option awards at december  was million which arose from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the unrecognized cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
other income expense the increase in other income expense during from reflects an increase in market yields on our cash and investment balances and a million reduction of interest expense as a result of the reduction of amounts outstanding on capital leases 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million loss for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service  and working capital to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of dis nuclear cameras  ultrasound machines  vans  and computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  high grade auction rate securities  corporate debt securities and government sponsored entities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe our current working capital together with cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations totaled million in due to cash flow from net income before non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
we reduced our net inventory levels during as we focused on purchasing processes and outsourcing initiatives 
we experienced an increase in our receivables  which primarily represents receivables generated by ultrasound imaging services 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million in million of cash was provided from the net maturities of securities available for sale  which was offset by million of cash used to acquire net assets from ultrascan  and million of cash used for capital expenditures primarily associated with our dis operations  net of cash received from sales of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to approximately million in  and represents the repayment of capital lease obligations  net of proceeds arising from the exercise of stock options 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan may require additional consideration of cash and common stock of up to million to be paid to the seller or its designees in the event that certain financial milestones are achieved over the next four years 
debt service as of december   we had capital lease obligations totaling million 
these obligations are secured by the specific equipment financed under each lease and will be repaid monthly over the lease terms  which range from to months 
our dis subsidiary entered into the majority of these capital lease obligations 
we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments using updated historical and anticipated results 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
consequently  actual results could differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from providing in office services to support the performance of nuclear imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  when all of the following four criteria are met a contract or sales arrangement exists  products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our dis revenue is recorded once the services and disposables are provided and consumed  which is normally on the day of the service 
for our product revenue  these criteria are usually met upon delivery  or shortly thereafter 
reductions to our dis revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments 
reductions to product revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments and credit memos 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
historically  the need to estimate reserves for accounts receivable has been mostly limited to our dis business 
within the product business  we book specific reserves for receivables that may be difficult to collect 
dis adjustments and credit memos are adjustments for billing errors that are normally adjusted within the first days subsequent to the performance of service  with the majority occurring within the first days 
reserves are provided as a percentage of dis revenue based on our historical experience rate 
we use a combination of factors in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
each account is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis and a reserve percentage varying from zero to for each account is established 
we do not establish reserves for accounts with a history of payment without disputes 
we generally reserve a portion of the outstanding balance for accounts that are more than days late and or under dispute 
we reserve of the outstanding balance for accounts that we believe constitute a high risk of default based on factors such as level of dispute  payment history and our knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its obligations 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectibility could be impacted by material amounts by changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
the provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as we only have a small number of customer accounts that have receivable balances in excess of k 
valuation of goodwill the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan resulted in the recording of goodwill 
we recorded these assets at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
we determine the fair value using the income approach  which bases the fair value on estimated future cash flows generated from the reporting unit s long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
we have not recognized an impairment loss related to goodwill 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and our estimates of future cash flows are based on the operational performance of the reporting unit  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
we record property and equipment at cost  and record other intangible assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
we calculate amortization on other intangible assets using either the accelerated or the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  based on the nature of when we expect to receive cash inflows generated by the intangible assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

the scope of sfas no 
includes long lived assets  or groups of assets  to be held and used as well as those which are to be disposed of by sale or by other method 
sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
we perform an annual review of the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including certain identifiable intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances quarterly for excess or obsolete inventory levels 
except where firm orders are on hand  we consider production inventory quantities in excess of the next months demand as excess and reserve for them at of cost  depending on our knowledge and forecast for the product 
service inventory in excess of months demand is likewise reserved at of cost 
we establish obsolescence reserves at for obsolete products 
we review the reserve quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
once the inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
warranty we provide a warranty on certain of our products and accrue the estimated cost at the time revenue is recorded 
since july  substantially all of the warranty periods have been months before customer sponsored maintenance begins 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems at customers covered by warranty 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
these options are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r 
we adopted sfas r on january   using the modified prospective method 
under this method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the provisions of sfas r apply only to the awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas  is recognized in net income in the periods after adoption 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards that are expected to vest are recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value is affected by certain assumptions  some of which are subjective by nature 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes merton model for the year ended december  were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield 
the weighted average expected option term for and reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option trenches 
we utilized this approach as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical data for forfeitures and we are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  to account for our equity compensation plans 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
those amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to cost of revenues and operations over the vesting period of the options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the return on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
