item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the summary consolidated financial data  our financial statements and the notes thereto  and other financial data included in this document 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section of this document captioned risk factors  and elsewhere in this document 
unless the context requires otherwise  the terms us  we  and our refer to home bancshares  inc on a consolidated basis 
general we are a financial holding company headquartered in conway  arkansas  offering a broad array of financial services through our five wholly owned bank subsidiaries 
as of december   we had  on a consolidated basis  total assets of billion  loans receivable of billion  total deposits of billion  and shareholders equity of million 
we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments  service charges  and mortgage banking income 
deposits are our primary source of funding 
our largest expenses are interest on these deposits and salaries and related employee benefits 
we measure our performance by calculating our return on average equity  return on average assets  and net interest margin 
we also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing non interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income

the current competitive pressures eased somewhat during  allowing for a comparable net interest margin from december  to december  by achieving strong loan growth that was funded by both the run off in the investment portfolio and more reasonably priced interest bearing liabilities 
our efficiency ratio calculated by dividing non interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income was for the year ended december   compared to for the improvement in our efficiency ratio is primarily due to an increase in net interest income from the net proceeds of our initial public offering and continued improvement of our operations

critical accounting policies overview 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document 
we consider a policy critical if i the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate  and ii different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial statements 
using these criteria  we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices  including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  investments  intangible assets  income taxes and stock options 
investments 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity and other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
loans receivable and allowance for loan losses 
substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge offs  as it is management s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff 
interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against income 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses on identifiable loans that may become uncollectible and probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the amounts of provisions for loan losses are based on management s analysis and evaluation of the loan portfolio for identification of problem credits  internal and external factors that may affect collectibility  relevant credit exposure  particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending  current collateral values and other relevant factors 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms thereof 
we apply this policy even if delays or shortfalls in payments are expected to be insignificant 
all non accrual loans and all loans that have been restructured from their original contractual terms are considered impaired loans 
the aggregate amount of impaired loans is used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and amount of provisions thereto 
losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when in the process of collection it appears likely that losses will be realized 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when accrual of interest is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 

table of contents loans are placed on non accrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful  or generally when loans are days or more past due 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
accrued interest related to non accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for loan losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year 
interest income on non accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received  although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal 
non accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than days past due  the customer has made required payments for at least six months  and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists 
the core deposit intangibles are being amortized over to months on a straight line basis 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter 
income taxes 
we use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities as reflected in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
any estimated tax exposure items identified would be considered in a tax contingency reserve 
changes in any tax contingency reserve would be based on specific development  events  or transactions 
we and our subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns 
our subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis  and remit to us amounts determined to be currently payable 
stock options 
prior to  we elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options using the fair value method 
under apb  because the exercise price of the options equals the estimated market price of the stock on the issuance date  no compensation expense is recorded 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 share based payment revised which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of the grant 
acquisitions and equity investments on january   we acquired centennial bancshares  inc  an arkansas bank holding company 
centennial bancshares  inc owned centennial bank  located in little rock  arkansas which had total assets of million  loans of million and total deposits of million on the date of acquisition 
the consideration for the merger was million  which was paid approximately  or million in cash and  or million  in shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition  million of the purchase price  consisting of  in cash and  shares of our common stock  was placed in escrow related to possible losses from identified loans and an irs examination 
the merger further provides for an earn out based upon earnings of up to a maximum of  which can be paid in cash or our stock at the election of the accredited shareholders 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of

as a result of this transaction  we recorded goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of million 
on january   we purchased of the common stock of white river bancshares  inc of fayetteville  arkansas for million 
white river bancshares is a newly formed corporation  which owns all of the stock of signature bank of arkansas  with branch locations in northwest arkansas 
in january  white river bancshares issued an additional million of common stock 
to maintain our ownership  we invested an additional million in white river bancshares at that time 
during april  white river bancshares acquired of the stock of brinkley bancshares  inc in brinkley  arkansas 
as a result  we made a million additional investment in white river bancshares on june  to maintain our ownership 
as of december   white river bancshares had total assets of million  loans of million  and total deposits of million 
on march   white river bancshares  inc repurchased our ownership for million in cash 
the repurchase by white river will result in one time pre tax gain of approximately million or diluted earnings per share for we have not specifically allocated the use of these proceeds 
the purpose may include paying down debt associated with our subordinated debentures  providing investments in our bank subsidiaries to support growth  including the development of additional banking offices or for general corporate purposes 
presently  we anticipate the additional funds will result in a modest accretion to the earnings per share of approximately to 
effective january   we purchased the remaining of tcbancorp that we did not previously own 
tcbancorp owned twin city bank  with branch locations in the little rock north little rock metropolitan area 
the purchase brought our ownership of tcbancorp to 
tcbancorp had total assets of million  loans of million and total deposits of million at the effective date of the acquisition 
we also assumed debt obligations with carrying values of million  which approximated their fair market values because the rates being paid on the obligations were at or near estimated current market rates 
the purchase price for the tcbancorp acquisition was million  which consisted of approximately  of cash and the issuance of  shares split adjusted of our common stock 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of million 
this transaction also increased our ownership of cb bancorp and firstrust financial services to  both of which we had previously co owned with tcbancorp 
in february  cb bancorp merged into home bancshares  and community bank thus became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in our continuing evaluation of our growth plans for the company  we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can complement our organic growth and de novo branching growth strategies 
the company s acquisition focus will be to expand in its primary market areas of arkansas and florida 
however  management was familiar with the texas market with a prior institution and  if opportunities arise  would look to expand through a banking acquisition in the texas market 
we are continually evaluating potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our company 
our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors 

table of contents de novo branching we intend to continue to open new commonly referred to de novo branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas if opportunities arise 
during  we opened six de novo branch locations 
these branch locations are located in the arkansas communities of quitman  searcy branches and bryant plus key west and key largo  florida 
also during  we consolidated two of our cabot branch locations into one financial center 
currently we have plans for two additional de novo branch locations in morrilton and cabot  arkansas

net interest income 
net interest income  our principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate 
the federal reserve board sets various benchmark rates  including the federal funds rate  and thereby influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions 
the federal funds rate  which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds  began in at 
during  the federal funds rate increased basis points to end the year at 
over the next quarters  the federal funds rate increased basis points in each of the six quarters until june  when it reached 
the rate then remained constant until september   when the federal funds rate was lowered by basis points to 
the federal funds rate decreased another basis points on october  and december  due to these reductions occurring late in  the impact for the year was minimal 
average interest rates for reflect the higher interest rate environment that existed until september  when the federal funds rate was lowered 
going forward  we will begin to see more of an impact of the decrease in the federal funds rate as our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities begin to reprice 
most recently  the rate decreased by basis points on january  and basis points on january  net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased to million for the year ended december   from million for this increase in net interest income was the result of an million increase in interest income offset by million increase in interest expense 
the million increase in interest income was primarily the result of organic growth of our bank subsidiaries combined with the repricing of our earning assets in the higher interest rate environment 
the higher level of earning assets resulted in an improvement in interest income of million  and our earning assets repricing in the higher interest rate environment resulted in a million increase in interest income during the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december   is primarily the result of organic growth of our bank subsidiaries combined with our interest bearing liabilities repricing in the higher interest rate environment

our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by applying the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
specific allocations are determined for loans considered to be impaired and loss factors are assigned to the remainder of the loan portfolio to determine an appropriate level in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is increased  as necessary  by making a provision for loan losses 
the specific allocations for impaired loans are assigned based on an estimated net realizable value after a thorough review of the credit relationship 
the potential loss factors associated with the remainder of the loan portfolio are based on an internal net loss experience  as well as management s review of trends within the portfolio and related industries 
generally  commercial  commercial real estate  and residential real estate loans are assigned a level of risk at origination 
thereafter  these loans are reviewed on a regular basis 
the periodic reviews generally include loan payment and collateral status  the borrowers financial data  and key ratios such as cash flows  operating income  liquidity  and leverage 
a material change in the borrower s credit analysis can result in an increase or decrease in the loan s assigned risk grade 
aggregate dollar volume by risk grade is monitored on an ongoing basis 
our management reviews certain key loan quality indicators on a monthly basis  including current economic conditions  delinquency trends and ratios  portfolio mix changes  and other information management deems necessary 
this review process provides a degree of objective measurement that is used in conjunction with periodic 
table of contents internal evaluations 
to the extent that this review process yields differences between estimated and actual observed losses  adjustments are made to the loss factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings  to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered adequate in relation to the estimated risk inherent in the loan portfolio

as of december   commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of our loan portfolio  compared to million  or of our loan portfolio  as of december  this increase is primarily the result of strong demand for this type of loan product which resulted in organic growth of our loan portfolio 
residential real estate loans

the majority of our residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by owner occupied  single family residences 
residential real estate loans generally have a loan to value ratio of up to

these loans have normal maturities of less than five years 
consumer loans 
our consumer loan portfolio is composed of secured and unsecured loans originated by our banks 
the performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economy as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies  job loss  divorce and other individual specific characteristics 
as of december   our installment consumer loan portfolio totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio  which is comparable to million  or of our loan portfolio  as of december  commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes  including working capital  inventory  equipment and capital expansion 
the terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years 
commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and  where appropriate  by adequate collateral 
commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow debt service coverage  primary and secondary sources of repayment  the financial strength of any guarantor  the borrower s liquidity and leverage  management experience  ownership structure  economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral 
the loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral 
generally speaking  accounts receivable are financed at between to of accounts receivable less than days past due 
inventory financing will range between and with no work in process depending on the borrower and nature of inventory 
we require a first lien position for those loans

when management determines that a loan is no longer performing  and that collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on non accrual status 
loans that are days past due are placed on non accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest 
our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  treated as special mention or otherwise classified or on non accrual status 
generally  non accrual loans that are days past due without assurance of repayment are charged off against the allowance for loan losses

our bank subsidiaries recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as non accrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued  unless the credit characteristics of the loan improves 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
total non performing loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  total non performing loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  while our goal is to maintain sound asset quality  there has been an increase in the non performing loans during the first quarter of during the first two months of  our non performing loans to total loans increased from at december  to as of february  part of this increase is related to our acquisition of centennial bancshares on january  which reported a non performing loans to total loans as of february  the remaining increase in non performing loans is indicative of the economic declines in a few of the markets that we serve  particularly in florida 
the appreciation of the real estate market in the florida keys has subsided  as a result of the sluggish economy 
the weakening real estate market has and may continue pushing up our level of non performing loans going forward 
when we report results for the first quarter of  we could see non performing loans to total loans in the range of approximately to 
as of the filing of this annual report  we have some concerns about our loan portfolio in that a couple of our markets are witnessing a slow down in sales and some price reduction 
the key is our borrower s ability to weather this economic storm 
while we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   as additional facts become known about relevant internal and external factors that effect loan collectability and our assumptions  it may result in us making additions to the provision for loan loss during 
table of contents if the non accrual loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements  interest income of approximately  for the year ended december    in  and  in would have been recorded 
interest income recognized on the non accrual loans for the years ended december   and was considered immaterial 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans 
impaired loans include non performing loans loans past due days or more and non accrual loans and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing 
as of december  and  average impaired loans were million and million  respectively 
at december  and  impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
while the year end impaired loans have increased  from to  these impaired loans only result in a slight increase in loss exposure 
as a result reserves relative to impaired loans at december   were million and million at december  the million increase in foreclosed assets held for sale is primarily the result of one credit located in the florida keys 
this foreclosure was an owner occupied strip center 
the space the proprietor occupied has subsequently been leased and the rest of the center is occupied 
this property has been written down to the estimated fair value 
we are cautiously optimistic that if there is loss on the sale of the strip center  it will not be material 
as a result of the building boom in northwest arkansas  this market is experiencing over development 
management will actively monitor the status of this market as it relates to our real estate loans and make changes to the allowance for loan losses if necessary 
as of december   we had two credits amounting to million in loans secured by real estate in northwest arkansas 
we anticipate no weakness in these credits as they are well secured by substantial guarantors 
at december   we had no loan participations in northwest arkansas with our unconsolidated affiliate white river bancshares  inc allowance for loan losses overview 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which our management believes is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provision of possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for our management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions 
if actual losses exceed the amount of allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be adversely affected 
as we evaluate the allowance for loan losses  we categorize it as follows i specific allocations  ii allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation  iii general allocations for each major loan category  and iv miscellaneous allocations 

table of contents specific allocations 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
our evaluation process in specific allocations includes a review of appraisals or other collateral analysis 
these values are compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance 
if a loss is determined to be reasonably possible  the possible loss is identified as a specific allocation 
if the loan is not collateral dependent  the measurement of loss is based on the expected future cash flows of the loan 
allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation 
we establish allocations for loans rated special mention through loss in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each loan category to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations 
we establish general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans  which are collectively evaluated for loss such as residential real estate  commercial real estate consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
we give consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information 
miscellaneous allocations 
allowance allocations other than specific  classified  and general are included in our miscellaneous section 
charge offs and recoveries 
total charge offs decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from million in total recoveries decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from million in total charge offs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in total recoveries increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from  in the changes in net charge offs are due to our conservative stance on asset quality

table of contents allocated allowance for loan losses 
we use a risk rating and specific reserve methodology in the calculation and allocation of our allowance for loan losses 
while the allowance is allocated to various loan categories in assessing and evaluating the level of the allowance  the allowance is available to cover charge offs incurred in all loan categories 
the unallocated portion of the allowance  although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent in estimating credit losses 
the changes for the year in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the individual types of loans for the most part are consistent with the changes in the outstanding loan portfolio for those products from december  in the opinion of management  any allocation changes not consistent with the changes in the loan portfolio product would be considered normal operating changes  not downgrading or upgrading of any one particular type of loans in the loan portfolio

table of contents investment securities our securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity 
fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities 
as of december  and  we had no held to maturity or trading securities 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as other comprehensive income 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors

certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost 
these declines primarily resulted from increases in market interest rates during and based on evaluation of available evidence  we believe the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary 
it is our intent to hold these securities to recovery 
should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other than temporary impairment is identified

the interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements 
we will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing and do not anticipate a significant change in total deposits unless our liquidity position changes 
we believe that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management liquidity management 
liquidity refers to the ability or the financial flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations 
maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available for reserve requirements  customer demand for loans  withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities 
our primary source of liquidity at our holding company is dividends paid by our bank subsidiaries 
applicable statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared by our bank subsidiaries 
further  any dividend payments are subject to the continuing ability of the bank subsidiary to maintain compliance with minimum federal regulatory capital requirements and to retain its characterization under federal regulations as a well capitalized institution 
each of our bank subsidiaries have potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers 
many of these obligations and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loans customers are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
liquidity needs can be met from either assets or liabilities 
on the asset side  our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  maturities of investment securities and scheduled repayments and maturities of loans 
we maintain adequate levels of cash and equivalents to meet our day to day needs 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balances were million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  as of december  our investment securities and fed funds sold were million as of december  and million as of december  as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of securities were pledged as collateral for various public fund deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

table of contents our commercial and real estate lending activities are concentrated in loans with maturities of less than five years with both fixed and adjustable rates 
as of december  and  approximately million  or  and million  or  respectively  of our loans matured within one year and or had adjustable interest rates 
additionally  we maintain loan participation agreements with other financial institutions in which we could participate out loans for additional liquidity should the need arise 
on the liability side  our principal sources of liquidity are deposits  borrowed funds  and access to capital markets 
customer deposits are our largest sources of funds 
as of december   our total deposits were billion  or of total assets  compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  we attract our deposits primarily from individuals  business  and municipalities located in our market areas 
we may occasionally use our fed funds lines of credit in order to temporarily satisfy short term liquidity needs 
we have fed funds lines with three other financial institutions pursuant to which we could have borrowed up to million and million on an unsecured basis as of december  and  respectively 
these lines may be terminated by the respective lending institutions at any time 
we also maintain lines of credit with the federal home loan bank 
our fhlb borrowings were million as of december  and million as of december  the outstanding balance for december   included million of short term advances and million of fhlb long term advances 
the outstanding balance for december   included million of short term advances and million of fhlb long term advances 
our fhlb borrowing capacity was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current operations 
market risk management 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
we do not hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
asset liability management 
our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk 
the asset liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiaries are also responsible for approving our asset liability management policies  overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position 
one of the tools that our management uses to measure short term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to re price immediately  and proportional to the change in market rates  depending on their contracted index 
some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment embedded options  and accordingly the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields 
our non term deposit products re price more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 

table of contents for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by and basis points  respectively 
at december   our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us 
table presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of december  table sensitivity of net interest income percentage change interest rate scenario from base up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points interest rate sensitivity 
our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings  primarily net interest income  are susceptible to changes in market interest rates 
it is management s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks 
a key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed 
the single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the more closely the repricing periods are correlated  the less interest rate risk we assume 
we use repricing gap and simulation modeling as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis attempts to capture the amounts and timing of balances exposed to changes in interest rates at a given point in time 
as of december   our gap position was slightly liability sensitive with a one year cumulative repricing gap of  compared to as of december  during these periods  the amount of change our asset base realizes in relation to the total change in market interest rates is slightly lower than that of the liability base 
as a result  our net interest income will have a slight negative affect in an environment of modestly rising rates 
our net interest income will have a slight positive affect in an environment of modestly declining rates 
we have a portion of our securities portfolio invested in mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities are included based on their assumed maturity date 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties
