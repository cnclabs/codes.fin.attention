today  dolby technologies are standard in a wide range of entertainment platforms 
our technologies are used in virtually all dvd players and personal computer dvd playback software  increasingly in digital televisions  set top boxes  portable media devices and in a wide array of consumer electronic products such as gaming systems and audio video receivers 
movie theatres and broadcasters around the world use dolby s products 
our objective is to be an essential element in the best entertainment technologies by delivering innovative and enduring technologies that enrich the entertainment experience 
we believe that our well recognized brand and established history of successful innovation position us to expand the use of our technologies in existing and new markets and to capitalize on key trends in digital entertainment  such as the transition to digital television  digital cinema  high definition home theater systems  portable media devices and downloadable content services 
we deliver innovative technologies  products and services at each stage of the entertainment industry  including content creation  content distribution and content playback 
our products and services teams focus on developing and delivering new innovations for the professional community 
this community includes filmmakers and exhibitors  television producers  music producers  and video game designers  who use dolby technologies to generate a more realistic and immersive entertainment experience 
similarly  our licensing team works with consumer electronics manufacturers and media software vendors to develop and incorporate innovations that are designed to improve the entertainment experience at home and on the go 
we believe that our involvement across the entertainment industry has resulted in a globally recognized brand and better positions us to meet our long term objective of being an essential element in the best entertainment technologies 
we are a global organization 
we generate revenue by licensing our technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronics products and media software vendors  and selling our professional products and related 
table of contents services to entertainment content creators  producers  and distributors 
we have licensed our technologies to manufacturers in approximately countries and our licensees distribute products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
we sell our products and services in over countries 
in fiscal  and  revenue from outside the united states was  and of our total revenue  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from outside of the united states is due to the shift in the mix of our revenue stream to the personal computer market  which is predominately comprised of large us based licensees 
opportunities  challenges and risks licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we categorize our licensing revenue into the following markets consumer electronics ce market primarily comprised of dvd players  dvd recorders  audio video receivers and home theaters in a box 
personal computer pc market primarily comprised of software dvd players  microsoft windows vista home premium and ultimate editions and pc entertainment experience 
broadcast market primarily comprised of televisions and set top boxes 
gaming market primarily comprised of video game consoles 
mobile primarily comprised of mobile devices 
automotive market primarily comprised of in car dvd players 
licensing services revenue from the administration of joint licensing programs 
historically  the consumer electronics market  which is driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd players  has been our largest market  generating approximately in fiscal and just under in fiscal however  in fiscal  it declined to just over and was surpassed by our personal computing market  which represented our largest market in fiscal the decrease in the consumer electronics market as a percentage of total licensing revenue has been due primarily to faster revenue growth in our other markets  primarily the pc and broadcast markets 
we expect blu ray disc players for high definition content to be a potential growth opportunity in the consumer electronics market 
dolby digital has been selected as a mandatory audio standard and dolby digital plus and dolby truehd have been selected as optional audio standards in the blu ray disc format 
the release and consumer adoption of blu ray disc players has been slower than expected due  in part  to the competition between hd dvd and blu ray disc formats 
even though uncertainty over the disc format was resolved in february when toshiba corporation announced that it would cease manufacturing hd dvd players  the rate of consumer adoption of blu ray disc players is uncertain and may be slower than past growth rates of standard definition dvd players 
our personal computing market  which represented just over of our licensing revenue in fiscal  approximately in fiscal and just over in fiscal  has been primarily driven by sales of software dvd players and to a lesser extent  dvd authoring applications 
historically  pc manufacturers have frequently included dvd playback functionality as part of the software applications included in their products 
in fiscal  microsoft introduced its windows vista operating system 
two of the six editions of this operating system  the windows vista home premium edition and the windows vista ultimate edition  include dolby technologies which help enable dvd playback functionality and dvd authoring capabilities 
since shipments of windows vista began in february  sales of personal computers for the consumer market offered with the home premium edition have been strong 
in addition  many major pc manufacturers continue to include additional branded software applications with dvd playback capabilities and other features which were not provided in the microsoft operating systems 
this contributed to an increase in licensing revenue from our pc market in the second half of fiscal and for the full year of fiscal additionally  through our pc entertainment experience  we are licensing a greater number of our technologies into entertainment oriented pcs 

table of contents in the future  pc manufacturers may elect to exclude additional dvd software applications on personal computers that include the windows vista home premium edition or windows vista ultimate edition 
it is unclear at what pace business customers will migrate from their current operating systems to the windows vista operating systems and how such adoption will impact sales of software dvd players for business pcs 
in addition  a growing number of low cost netbooks or sub notebooks are being sold which do not have microsoft vista operating systems and do not always have dvd playback functionality or dolby technologies 
we expect an increasing number of consumers will elect to purchase these netbooks which would cause our pc revenue growth rate to decline 
our broadcast market  which is primarily driven by demand for dolby digital in televisions and set top boxes  represented just over of our licensing revenue in fiscal  just over in fiscal and just under in fiscal our broadcast market has benefited from increased global shipments of set top boxes and digital televisions in north america  an increased percentage of televisions sold in europe that contain our technologies and the contribution of revenue from digital converter boxes 
in addition  we view broadcast services operating under particular bandwidth constraints  such as terrestrial broadcast or iptv services  as an area of opportunity for us to offer dolby digital plus and he aac  which are able to deliver multi channel surround sound at reduced bit rates 
we expect revenue from our broadcast market to increase as a percentage of licensing revenue in fiscal notwithstanding our success in the broadcast market to date  we may not be able to capitalize on these opportunities and actual results may differ from our expectations 
revenue generated from the gaming and automotive markets have primarily been driven by sales of video game consoles and in car entertainment systems with dolby digital and atrac technology 
revenue generated by our licensing services market has primarily been driven by demand for mpeg audio and mpeg audio technologies used in portable media devices 
revenue from our mobile market is primarily driven by demand for our he aac technology incorporated into mobile devices and to a lesser degree by sales of mobile devices incorporating dolby mobile 
we view the mobile market as an area of opportunity to increase revenue from mobile devices  however actual results may differ from our expectations 
we have also introduced new technologies for the broadcast and consumer electronics markets  including dolby volume  and dynamic range image technologies 
our dolby volume technology controls the loudness of audio broadcasts to provide a constant volume level 
dolby contrast provides enhanced contrast  while dolby vision combines enhanced contrast with extended brightness and dynamic range for lcd televisions with led backlit technology 
we do not anticipate generating significant revenue from these technologies in fiscal our technologies are incorporated in consumer electronics and digital entertainment products throughout the world 
we expect that sales of products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies  such as china and india  will increase in the future as consumers in these geographical markets have more disposable income available to purchase entertainment products  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we also expect that manufacturers from lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production of consumer electronics and digital entertainment products in the future to satisfy this increased demand 
these are risks associated with opportunities of doing business in these emerging economies  such as china  that have affected and will continue to affect our operating results  such as manufacturers failing to report or underreporting product shipments 
product sales consists of revenue from sales of equipment to cinema operators and broadcasters representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our cinema products  which represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal  are primarily used to read and decode film s soundtrack  calibrate cinema sound systems and to adapt analog cinema audio systems to digital audio formats 
our digital cinema servers load  store  decrypt and decode encrypted digital film files for presentation on a digital 
table of contents projector  and our digital d products provide d capabilities 
sales of our cinema products and services tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the motion picture industry 
there is a trend in the cinema industry towards the adoption of digital cinema 
digital cinema offers the motion picture industry possible means to achieve substantial cost savings in printing and distributing movies  to combat piracy  and to enable movies to be played repeatedly without degradation in image and audio quality 
in fiscal  we introduced our dolby digital cinema server  which allows for the storage and playback of digital content and in fiscal we introduced dolby d digital cinema technology  which delivers a d experience when combined with an exhibitor s existing digital cinema server 
the cinema industry is in the early stages of adoption of digital cinema and we expect that exhibitors constructing new theatres or upgrading existing theatres will generally choose digital cinema over traditional film cinema 
digital cinema is based on open standards  which unlike traditional cinema  does not include our proprietary audio formats 
as the market for digital cinema grows  we continue to face more competitive pricing pressure than we have historically experienced for traditional cinema products  which adversely impacts our product sales gross margins and digital cinema market share 
if our digital cinema servers are not widely deployed  our future prospects in digital cinema will be limited and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
generally  as the film industry has adopted digital cinema the demand for our traditional cinema products and services has declined and we anticipate that the demand for film based products will continue to decline in future periods 
our broadcast products  which represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal  are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
in recent years  growth in consumer demand for high quality television content has increased the demand from broadcasters to deliver more content in dolby digital surround sound  which has contributed to sales of our professional broadcast products 
our services revenue  which represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  is primarily tied to the motion picture production industry and  in particular  to the number of films being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
the number of films that are produced can be affected by a number of factors  including strikes and work stoppages within the motion picture industry as well as by the tax incentive arrangements that many foreign governments provide filmmakers to promote local filmmaking 
recent deteriorating macroeconomic conditions are creating uncertainty regarding consumer demand in the markets into which we license and sell products and the timing and availability of funding for system integrators to finance digital cinema rollouts in which we could participate 
the extent to which these conditions will persist and the overall impact they will have on consumer spending is not clear 
our business is particularly exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions  because products that incorporate our technologies are entertainment oriented and generally discretionary goods  such as dvd players  personal computers  digital televisions  mobile devices  set top boxes  portable media devices  gaming systems and audio video receivers 
although recent macroeconomic conditions have reportedly adversely affected consumer confidence  disposable income and spending  we believe this generally is not reflected in our fiscal year ended september  results because our recognized licensing revenue generally lags one quarter following sales of products that incorporate our technologies 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions to license technologies  trademarks and know how  and to sell products and services using the criteria set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab 
for revenue transactions that involve software or software related products  such as fees we earn from integrated software vendors  certain product sales with software elements and certain other transactions  we recognize revenue under the guidance established by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
both sab and sop state that revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution  or an alternative credit evaluation 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether the software element included with a hardware product is more than incidental to the hardware  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
for some of our arrangements  customers receive certain elements of the arrangement over a period of time or after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive product upgrades 
the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated period for which these elements will be delivered  which is sometimes the estimated life of the product 
if we do not have vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement containing software  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and or services have been performed  or until we have vsoe of fair value of all remaining undelivered elements 
if the undelivered element is support and we do not have fair value for the support element  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
as required by sfas  we perform an impairment test on recorded goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of each unit  including goodwill 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined by using a discounted cash flow model which considers a number of factors  including estimated future cash flows  risks facing us and our current market capitalization 
if the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units  including goodwill  were to exceed our estimation of the fair value of the reporting units  we would record an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we use judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units  which include making assumptions of our future cash flows for each reporting unit 
our fiscal impairment test of goodwill  which was performed in the third quarter of fiscal  resulted in no impairment charge 
fluctuations in our fair value  which may result from changes in economic conditions  our results of operations and other factors  relative to the carrying value  could result in impairment charges in future periods 

table of contents accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fin upon adoption of fin  our cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a corresponding increase in retained earnings by million 
we had historically classified interest  penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities 
beginning with the adoption of fin  we classify interest  penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment of cash within one year as non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits with interest and penalties as of the date of adoption of fin was million  of which million  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
as of september   the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits with interest and penalties was million  of which million  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
our total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and uncertainty in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model requires that we make certain assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award and the risk free interest rate over the expected term 
we develop our assumptions for the black scholes pricing model in accordance with guidelines set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
we estimate the expected term of stock based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees and applying an assumption of future exercise patterns 
we utilize a blend of our historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility based on traded options with similar terms as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
investments we account for investment securities under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas and related interpretations and staff positions 
sfas requires us to record available for sale securities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses being reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions were incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of certain of our investments 
the analysis considered  among other factors  the collateral underlying the security investments  
table of contents creditworthiness of the counterparty  timing of expected future cash flows  and the probability of a successful recovery in a future period 
additionally  we use judgment in evaluating whether declines in fair value are temporary or other than temporary considering a variety of factors including the existence of the following indicators changes in credit ratings or asset quality  changes in the economic environment  changes in market conditions  and changes in expected cash flows 
temporary declines in fair value are recorded as charges to accumulated other comprehensive income  while other than temporary declines in fair value are recorded to earnings 
results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  revenue fiscal year ended change september  september  in thousands licensing percentage of total revenue product sales percentage of total revenue services percentage of total revenue total revenue licensing 
the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was driven by increased revenue in all our markets  most notably our pc  broadcast  gaming and mobile markets 
we do not expect to sustain such levels of licensing growth in fiscal due to a slowdown in consumer spending  an expected lower percentage of pcs sold with our technologies due to increased growth in netbooks  which do not have microsoft vista operating systems  and an expected decline in sales of dvd players 
historically  revenue from our consumer electronics market represented the largest percentage of our total licensing revenue 
in fiscal  revenue from our consumer electronics market declined as a percentage of our total licensing revenue and was surpassed by revenue from our pc market 
the increase in revenue from our pc market in fiscal  was primarily driven by a full year of microsoft vista home premium and ultimate edition related revenues as compared to only half a year in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  licensing revenue benefited from a growing number of consumer notebook computer shipments with dolby pc entertainment experience  compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our broadcast market has been driven by an increase in the number of digital televisions in north america and europe that incorporate dolby digital compared to a year ago  as well as shipments of set top boxes that incorporate our technologies 
the increase in revenue from our gaming market was primarily driven by sales of game consoles 
the increase in revenue from our mobile market was primarily driven by the inclusion of he aac technology  obtained through our acquisition of coding technologies in fiscal  which is incorporated into mobile devices 
product sales 
the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of our d products  which were minimal in fiscal as our d offering was introduced during the latter part of fiscal  as well as an increase in sales of our broadcast products  digital cinema processors and media adapters 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our traditional cinema products 
as the cinema industry transitions to the use of digital cinema audio equipment  we expect sales of our traditional cinema products to continue to decline in future periods 
we have developed a digital cinema server  but have not recognized most of the revenue related to sales of our digital cinema servers due to certain obligations  which we have yet to satisfy 
we currently have approximately million of deferred revenue related to digital cinema server and certain d product sales 

table of contents services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly services on original films  including digital films  as well as revenue from virtual print fees related to digital cinema 
gross margin fiscal year ended september  september  licensing gross margin percentage product sales gross margin percentage services gross margin percentage total gross margin percentage licensing gross margin 
we license to our customers intellectual property that may be internally developed  acquired by us or licensed from other parties 
our cost of licensing consists principally of royalty obligations to third parties for the licensing of intellectual property rights that we sublicense as part of our licensing arrangements with our customers 
our cost of licensing also includes amortization expenses associated with purchased intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was appropriate to cease accruing royalty expense related to an ongoing dispute with an unrelated patent licensor 
as a result  our licensing gross margin was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal for further detail  see the discussion regarding accrued liabilities in the notes to our financial statements 
the increase in licensing gross margin was partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets that were acquired as part of the acquisition of coding technologies in the first quarter of fiscal product sales gross margin 
cost of product sales primarily consists of material costs related to the products sold  applied labor and manufacturing overhead and  to a lesser extent  amortization of certain intangible assets 
product sales gross margin decreased by from fiscal to fiscal  due to the decline in sales of our traditional cinema products and the increase in sales of our d products  digital cinema processors and media adapters  which have lower margins than our traditional cinema products 
upon satisfying certain contractual obligations  we expect to recognize revenue and associated costs related to a number of digital cinema servers and d products that are currently deferred 
we expect that upon the eventual recognition  our product sales gross margins will be adversely impacted because these products were sold at a significantly lower margin than our other products 
at september   we have approximately million of deferred revenue related to these digital cinema servers and d products  and a corresponding million of associated costs 
services gross margin 
cost of services primarily consists of the payroll and benefits costs of employees performing our professional services  the cost of outside consultants and reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of customers 
services gross margin was flat year over year

selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel related expenses  professional service fees  travel related expenses and facility costs for our sales  marketing and administrative functions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses and related occupancy and travel expenses 
these increases were primarily driven by increases in headcount related to our growth initiatives and the acquisition of coding technologies  bonus expense and annual pay increases for existing employees 
amortization expense increased due to an increase in intangible assets from the acquisitions of coding technologies in november and brightside technologies  inc brightside in april selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to increases in professional consulting expenses and impairment charges 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new technologies and products 
the increase in research and development expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses due to increases in headcount related to our growth initiatives and the acquisition of coding technologies  bonus expense and annual pay increases for existing employees 
gain on settlements 
gain on settlements includes payments received related to the resolution of disputes with implementation licensees from which we typically do not earn royalties 
in contrast  amounts attributable to the resolution of royalty disputes from licensees that specifically represent unpaid royalties that are subsequently paid are recorded as licensing revenue in the period payment is received and the dispute is resolved  if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

table of contents also included are gains or losses from foreign currency transactions 
the decrease in other income  net from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances as a result of the acquisition of coding technologies in november as well as lower interest rates and market conditions resulting in lower return on investments 
income taxes fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in certain manufacturing incentive tax deductions from fiscal  which included a revision of our estimates 
further  the increase in our effective tax rate was a result of the comparative decreases in the amount of research and development tax credits we estimated we would generate for the year ended september  as a result of the december expiration of the federal law providing for research and development credits 
after the close of fiscal  congress enacted the reinstatement of the research and development tax credits that expired in december consequently  dolby will be able to claim three quarters of additional credits as a discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal the impact of this on our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal would have been an additional reduction in taxes of million or a decrease of on our effective tax rate

the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased revenue from our personal computer market and broadcast market  and to a lesser extent  from our consumer electronics and gaming markets 
the increase in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by continued growth in shipments of notebook computers  the release of microsoft vista home premium and ultimate editions  which contain dolby technologies  as well as the continued inclusion of additional software dvd player applications by pc manufacturers 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market has been driven by growth in sales of digital televisions and cable and satellite set top boxes that incorporate our technologies 
our consumer electronics market benefited from continued diversification of consumer electronics products containing our technologies  including home theater in a box systems  audio video receivers  camcorders and portable media devices 

table of contents product sales 
the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales of our broadcast and live sound products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our cinema products 
sales of our broadcast products continued to benefit from broadcasters worldwide expanding their capabilities for delivering content in dolby digital surround sound 
in the cinema market  fiscal product sales benefited from new theatre construction  which appears to have slowed in fiscal in fiscal  a significant portion of our sales efforts was focused on our digital cinema initiative 
due to certain contractual and implied obligations requiring us to deliver software upgrades that we have not yet delivered  we are unable to recognize sales of our digital cinema servers 
as of september   we had approximately million of deferred revenue associated with these sales 
services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly services on original films  including digital films  as well as commercials and trailers  and revenue from virtual print fees related to digital cinema

in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a collaboration agreement with walt disney pictures and television under which we deployed digital cinema servers in selected theatres throughout the us we funded the majority of the equipment and installation costs related to this deployment  of which the majority was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal cost of product sales for fiscal includes approximately million in charges recorded in connection with this collaboration agreement 
the increase in product sales gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to these charges 
upon satisfying certain contractual obligations requiring us to deliver software upgrades that we have not yet delivered  we expect to recognize revenue and associated costs in fiscal related to sales of digital cinema servers that are currently deferred 
upon recognition  our product sales gross margins will be adversely impacted because these products were sold at a significantly lower margin than our other products 
at september   we had approximately million of deferred revenue related to these digital cinema servers  and a corresponding million of associated costs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash  money market funds and municipal debt securities 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which consisted of united states government agency securities  variable rate demand notes  auction rate certificates and municipal debt with original maturities greater than days 
many of these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could impact our results 
at september  the average investment maturity of our investment portfolio was less than six months 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on the carrying value of our portfolio 
furthermore  a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on interest income over a one year period 
we face market risks for changes in interest rates primarily related to our auction rate securities 
during fiscal  auction rate certificate issuers were reporting an inability to successfully obtain subscribers for high credit quality auction rate certificates 
as of september   we held such auction rate certificates with a par value totaling million 
in the event we need access to the funds invested in these securities  we will not be able to liquidate these securities until a future auction of these securities is successful  they are refinanced and redeemed by the issuers  or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag  which we refer to  along with its wholly owned subsidiaries ubs financial services  inc and ubs securities llc  as ubs to liquidate our auction rate certificates held in ubs accounts on february  the ubs offer entitles us to sell our auction rate certificates for a price equal to the liquidation preference of the auction rate certificates plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  if any  at any time during a two year period from june  through july  there is a risk that ubs will not perform its obligations in accordance with their offer 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will be able to recoup our investments in the auction rate certificates 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom 
also  as a result of our acquisition of european entities in the first quarter of fiscal  we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily euros and british pounds 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
most of our revenue from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currency 
therefore  if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  we will have increased operating expenses which are only partially offset by increased net revenues 
similarly  our net assets  net revenues and operating expenses will decrease and affect our net income  if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility
