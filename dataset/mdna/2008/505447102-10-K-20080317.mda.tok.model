item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and the notes to such statements included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to those discussed in risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
executive overview our net loss was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the same period in in both periods  our us gaap earnings were affected by significant non cash accounting adjustments such as the impairment charges for goodwill and stock listing rights of million and million  respectively  and the non cash loss in our nyx shares in of million compared to a gain of million in excluding these items and the related tax expenses or benefits  our pro forma net income for the years ended december  and were million and million  or and per diluted share  respectively 
our operating revenues began to stabilize in the second half of and our specialist and market making segment reported pre tax earnings before impairment charges and losses on our nyx shares of million 
we are actively taking steps to reduce and eliminate expenses reported at the holding company and continue to examine ways to improve our institutional brokerage operations performance in the coming year 
our specialist and market making segment performance improved significantly in the fourth quarter of over the third quarter  principally due to better market conditions and better market making trading 
our specialist and market making operations other than cash equities continue to show progress and growth and now represent more than of the segment revenue 
as previously disclosed  we have consistently believed that new and varied trading venues and products will develop and grow as the securities markets evolve and converge  and that global and alternative securities markets will increasingly interact with each other 
as such  our liquidity providing activities outside the nyse floor operations are increasingly becoming a major component of our specialist and market making operations 
our expansion into these new products and increased globalization has given us opportunities which we believe will allow us to further grow and diversify our business 
our market making subsidiary in london had its best performance to date in  and we believe the further globalization of electronic markets will provide us additional opportunities for growth and diversification going forward 
we also believe that we are successfully making the transition to newer business lines  which will benefit us and our stockholders 
we continue to devote significant resources to develop and improve our trading technologies and algorithms to enable our specialists and market makers to inject liquidity in a nearly fully electronic securities marketplace 
however  we cannot estimate or forecast additional revenue  if any  that could result from new trading technologies or increased participation rates 
we also believe that certain regulatory and market structure improvements are being implemented to recognize the nearly fully automated global securities markets 
for example  in february  the sec approved  with immediate effect  a reduction in the required nla that need to be maintained by cash equity specialists to transact business on the nyse by approximately 
this resulted in a reduction of our required nla by approximately million  of which million has been moved to our holding company for redeployment to use for other current or future corporate purposes 
we also believe steps are being taken by regulators to end abusive odd lot trading practices  which have increased in the automated marketplace and which we believe have significantly harmed our trading results 
the nyse has publicly stated that it plans to seek approval from the sec to further change its market model  changing the role of specialists to designated market makers who will still provide liquidity  but without some of the negative and affirmative obligations that could  at times  adversely affect profitability 
the purported rule changes could also change the timing of when the designated market maker can see orders  but could enable the designated market maker to provide liquidity and trade for its own account when it desires to do so 
we believe that some of these possible market structure changes could have a positive effect on our profitability by allowing us to trade with more freedom and without the informational advantage that resulted in a number of the trading restrictions to which we are subject as a specialist 
it also could allow us to benefit from organization changes and integration  because some of these changes presumably would remove the informational barriers that have caused us to maintain our specialist and market making businesses as separate broker dealers 
we currently are unable to project if or when any of these market structure changes  or other informational barrier changes will be formally proposed or passed  if at all 
we are continuing to reduce costs at our holding company and our operating subsidiaries  most of which are associated with the former auction based market structure 
the largest of these costs is the interest on our outstanding senior notes  which impacts our earnings by at least million annually 
since january   we have purchased approximately million of our outstanding senior notes  which will reduce our net interest expense going forward by approximately million annually 
any additional purchases of our outstanding notes will result in additional expense savings at our holding company  which should cause our results to improve 
we have employed more capital in our trading activities on more exchanges  and in derivative products and etfs  in seeking growth opportunities while maintaining a leadership position in the cash equities specialist business 
recent reductions in the capital requirement of our nyse specialist operations  including the million reduction of our required nla in february  will enable us to more effectively deploy capital for our business and financial needs 
the restructuring of certain of our specialist and market making subsidiaries has allowed us to develop those operations across various domestic and international exchanges and market places 
the organizational structure of our specialist and market making segment  therefore  is intended to enable us to better allocate and deploy our capital  workforce and technology across our operations in order to more efficiently seek out opportunities as they arise 
we believe lfs is in a position to build upon its reputation as a strong institutional trading firm 
lfs s primary business will continue to be facilitation trading  with expected growth to be generated through the addition of experienced personnel  new client trading partners and a new capital commitment focus 
capital will be used to accommodate customer business as well as for proprietary trading 
the addition of a proprietary book is expected to generate a new source of revenue from trading opportunities that present themselves in the marketplace 
our clients will continue to receive excellent customer service by means of market commentary and color  efficient execution  strong liquidity and confidentiality 
new accounting developments accounting for tax uncertainties in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin no 
effective january  please refer to footnote  income taxes of our condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information and disclosure 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas nullifies the guidance in eitf which precluded the recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract  unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price  or other valuation technique incorporating observable market data 
sfas also precludes the use of a liquidity or block discount  when measuring instruments traded in an active market at fair value 
sfas requires that costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value should not be capitalized  but rather should be expensed as incurred 
sfas also clarifies that an issuer s credit standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application permitted and encouraged 
sfas must be applied prospectively  except that the provisions related to block discounts and the guidance in eitf are to be applied as a one time cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the first interim period for the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we currently report the majority of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in compliance with industry guidelines for brokers and dealers in securities 
we have a significant investment in intangibles and goodwill as well as public debt which is not accounted for at fair value 
we believe sfas exempts intangible assets and goodwill from fair value reporting 
we also believe the adoption of sfas will have an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
however  it is unlikely we will mark to market the value of the public debt 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in april  the fasb issued a staff position fsp fin no 
 amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin no 
defines right of setoff and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff 
it also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position 
in addition  this fsp permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments 
the provisions of this fsp are consistent with our current accounting practice 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application permitted 
the adoption of fsp fin no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date in estimating the fair value of our specialist reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of the fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill annually as of december  unless an event or change in circumstances requires an interim reassessment of impairment 
during the second quarter of  certain changes in circumstances occurred that led us to believe that the fair value of our specialist and market making segment could be lower than its carrying amount 
the primary factor triggering our decision to reassess the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill was the sale of labranche co 
llc s amex equity specialist assets for less than their carrying value 
in our second quarter sfas no 
test  we compared the fair value of our specialist and market making reporting unit and the fair value of our specialist and market making reporting unit s goodwill based on the methods described above to their respective carrying values in two separate steps under sfas no 
guidelines to arrive at the million impairment charge we recognized during the fiscal second quarter 
despite our interim valuation of goodwill as of june   sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill on an annual calendar basis unless an additional event or change in circumstances requires an interim impairment test 
another of our intangible assets  as defined under sfas no 
 is our trade name 
we determine the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying amount of our trade name on an annual basis in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  our trade name was tested and based upon our analysis  no impairment existed at that time 
we have amortized our identifiable intangible stock listing rights over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
during the quarter ended june   certain changes in circumstances occurred that led us to believe that the fair value of our specialist stock listing rights could be lower than their carrying amount 
the primary factor triggering our decision to reassess the reasonableness of the carrying value of our stock listing rights was the sale of labranche co 
llc s amex equity specialist operations for less than their carrying value 
in our second quarter sfas no 
test  we compared the fair value of our specialist and market making reporting unit and the fair value of our specialist and market making reporting unit s stock listing rights based on the methods described above to their respective carrying values in two separate steps under sfas no 
guidelines 
at june   we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis of forecasted earnings from our acquired specialist stock lists 
due to a significant decrease in revenues as a result of the nyse s hybrid market implementation  the after tax cash flows from our acquired lists did not exceed the mandatory charge for contributory assets  the largest being the million nla requirement 
the million impairment charge represented a total impairment of our acquired specialist stock lists due to a negative cash flow under the contributory asset model used for testing and as such no impairment analysis will be required going forward  since we have fully written off the value of our stock listing rights 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors at december   with the assistance of the independent business valuation firm  we determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill under sfs no 
we cannot provide assurance that future goodwill impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
for our year end goodwill impairment tests  we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our bev analyses 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of the fair value of our goodwill 
non marketable securities the use of fair value to measure certain non marketable investments is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies  limited liability company interests and limited partnership interests  which do not have readily available price quotations 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities  we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting  and for our investment in a limited partnership interest  we adjust its carrying value by recognizing our share of the partnership s quarterly results of operations 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to non marketable investments in estimating their fair value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
given management s judgment involved in valuing certain of our non marketable securities  it is possible  as of a given point in time  that a third party could reach a different conclusion of fair value utilizing the same variables as we have in our analysis 
we account for our investment in nyx shares at estimated fair value of such restricted and non restricted shares pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide brokers and dealers in securities 
non marketable investments are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that such investment s carrying value may be impaired 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
see legal proceedings in part ii  item of this quarterly report on form q for information on our judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
institutional brokerage risk our institutional brokerage segment  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions as agent 
the execution of these transactions can result in unrecorded market risk and concentration of credit risk 
our institutional brokerage activities involve execution and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose us to risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and we have to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to significant market risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
restructuring transactions as of january   we converted our labranche financial services  inc lfsi subsidiary into a limited liability company through a merger of lfsi with and into a newly formed limited liability company  which succeeded to all the rights  obligations and liabilities of lfsi 
subsequently  on january   the new entity changed its name to labranche financial services  llc

generally  an increase in the average daily share volume on the nyse  an increase in volatility as measured by the average closing price of the cboe s volatility index  or the vix  an increase in the dollar value and share volume of our principal shares or a decrease in program trading enables us to increase our level of principal participation and thus our ability to realize net gain on principal transactions 
while we monitor these metrics each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated company news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the increase in net gain on principal transactions in our specialist and market making segment was attributable to operations other than our cash equity businesses 
this was offset by lower revenues from cash equities specialist activities as that business went through a substantial transition to the hybrid electronic market 
the nyse market also had significant market share losses from in to in commission and other fees revenue during decreased primarily as the result of the nyse rule change in december implementing the specialist allocation pool payment  and in september  the lpp program  which was different than the commission program for specialists on certain limit order transactions that terminated in december through august  we received specialist allocation pool payments in the amount of million per month and lpp payments in the aggregate amount of million from september to december stock borrow interest increased mainly due to the increased trading opportunities for our non cash equities specialist and market making activities

year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decline in net gain on principal transactions in our specialist and market making segment was attributable primarily to our cash equity specialist operations 
the decrease was due to a decline in principal shares traded  as well as market volatility  as measured by the average closing price of the vix  which was unchanged year over year 
other factors that reduced our opportunity to participate was the continuing rise in program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume and decreases in nyse average daily share volume and dollar value of principal shares traded of stocks for which we are the equity specialist

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in government obligations maturing within three months  cash and securities segregated under federal regulations and overnight repurchase agreements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with retained earnings from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a specialist  market maker and execution agent  the amount of our cash and short term investments  as well as operating cash flow  may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar value of our positions as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements  among others 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were as follows total years s omitted short term and long term debt operating lease obligations total the above information excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period that it might potentially be paid to tax authorities 
in january and february  we purchased and cancelled million of our outstanding senior notes due and million of our senior notes due in open market transactions 
accordingly  as of march   following the purchases of this indebtedness  our total outstanding short and long term debt was million  our debt with maturities of between one and three years was million and our debt with maturities over five years was million 
the above table includes indebtedness with primarily long term maturities  the interest and principal payments of which have a significant effect on the cash available to finance our current and future operations 
as of december   our most significant long term indebtedness was the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may  and the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may however  as noted above in the footnote under the table  as of march   our most significant long term indebtedness was million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may  and million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may at december   our net cash capital position was million 
fluctuations in net cash capital are common and are a function of variability in our total assets  balance sheet composition and total capital 
we attempt to maintain cash capital sources in excess of our aggregate longer term funding requirements ie  positive net cash capital 
over the previous months  our net cash capital has averaged above million 
millions cash capital available stockholders equity subordinated debt promissory note long term debt year other holding company liabilities total cash capital available cash capital required regulatory capital working capital nyx unrestricted shares illiquid assets long term investments subsidiary intercompany total cash capital required net cash capital in february  our regulatory capital was reduced by million as a result of the reduction of the nla specialist capital requirement 
cash capital available is mainly comprised of stockholders equity  long term debt  subordinated debt and other liabilities of our parent holding company which  in the aggregate  constitute the currency used to purchase our assets and provide our working capital 
this amount will principally be affected as debt matures or is refinanced and as earnings are retained or paid as dividends 
cash capital required mainly consists of the assets used in our businesses 
regulatory capital is defined as capital required by the sec and applicable exchanges to be maintained by broker dealers 
it is principally comprised of cash  net equities  other investments and net receivables from other broker dealers 
working capital constitutes liquid assets provided to our subsidiaries in excess of the required regulatory capital 
illiquid assets and long term investments are mainly comprised of exchange memberships  intangible assets  such as goodwill  tradename and stock listing rights  deposits  deferred taxes and non marketable investments 
net cash capital is considered to be the excess of cash capital available over cash capital required  or free cash  which we can utilize to fund our business needs 
we also monitor alternative funding measures in addition to our available net cash 
the alternative funding measures are significant transactions and actions we could take in a short term time frame to generate cash to meet debt maturities or other business needs 
more precisely  as of december   we have identified the following alternative funding measures to support future debt maturity requirements liquidation of available net invested capital at certain subsidiaries reduction of excess capital at labranche co 
llc to only required nla excess nla dividend further reduction of nla requirements by the nyse and sec and our restricted and unrestricted nyx shares  as previously discussed  can be either sold or held as good capital as their restrictions are removed 
if the shares are held as good capital  no tax charge is applied and cash can be freed from its current use as nla capital 
alternative funding measures millions net cash capital unrestricted nyx shares further reduction of nla requirements excess regulatory capital at subsidiaries restricted nyx shares total cash available from alternative funding measures nyse new nla requirements  approved in february by sec 
computed on an after tax basis and after a million reduction for nyx shares used as regulatory capital 
based on nyx price of per share on december  subject to regulatory approval prior to distribution to the holding company 
in addition to the alternative funding measures above  we monitor the maturity profile of our unsecured debt to minimize refinancing risk and we maintain relationships with debt investors and bank creditors 
strong relationships with a diverse base of creditors and debt investors are critical to our liquidity 
we also maintain available sources of short term funding that exceed actual utilization  thus allowing us to accommodate changes in investor appetite and credit capacity for our debt obligations 
with respect to the management of refinancing risk  the maturity profile of our long term debt portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis and structured within the context of two significant debt tranches with a significant spread of years between maturities mid term and long term 
thus  we have strategically negotiated debt terms maturing in and for the significant debt tranches 
in addition  the debt tranches have call provisions which allow pre maturity retirements as early as the debt tranches have available maturities and calls over the six year period through to allow us maximum flexibility in satisfying the debt maturities with payments and or sufficient time to refinance the long term debt as required 
the following chart profiles our long term debt maturity schedule as of december  logo our outstanding senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture which includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
in addition  our ability to make so called restricted payments  such as incurring additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  paying dividends  redeeming stock or repurchasing subordinated indebtedness prior to maturity  is limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is at or below a threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  or ebitda  and the sum of our consolidated interest expense and a tax effected multiple of any dividend payments with respect to our preferred stock 
as of december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  was  which means we currently cannot make any restricted payments  other than repurchasing our outstanding senior notes and any restricted payments up to an aggregate of million over the life of the indenture 
even though our fixed charge coverage ratio is below  we are still in compliance with all our covenants under the indenture 
in addition  under the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  if  at any time  our cumulative restricted payments since may  generally are greater than i the sum of a of our cumulative consolidated net income  as defined in the indenture  since july  or  if such calculation is a loss  minus of such loss and b of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock since july   plus ii million  we will not be entitled to make a restricted payment at such time 
as of december   of our cumulative consolidated net income since july  was million  and we had received approximately million upon the exercise of options since july  as explained above  however  our fixed charge coverage ratio currently is below and accordingly  we are unable to make restricted payments greater than the million basket described above 
while we have not made any restricted payments since may   we cannot be sure if  when or to what extent this covenant will prevent or limit us from making restricted payments in the future 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes permits us to redeem some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  and some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  at varying redemption prices  depending on the date of redemption 
in addition  we have the option to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of and up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of using the proceeds of certain equity offerings which we may complete on or prior to may  under the terms of the indenture  if we sell substantially all our assets or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding senior notes  on a pro rata basis  at a price in cash equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
to the extent we repurchase any outstanding senior notes in connection with future corporate strategic initiatives  our fixed term interest payments would be correspondingly reduced 
as of december   the subordinated indebtedness of labranche co 
llc aggregated million 
this subordinated debt is comprised of senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  which mature on various dates between february and june and bear interest at annual rates ranging from to 
the senior subordinated notes were originally issued in the aggregate principal amount of million  and  in accordance with their terms  million in principal amount must be repaid on june of each of    and labranche co 
llc repaid million in accordance with these terms in each of june   and labranche co 
llc may prepay  at a premium  all or any part of such senior subordinated notes at any time  provided that the amount prepaid is not less than of the aggregate principal amount of such senior subordinated notes then outstanding 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  labranche co 
llc may  but is not required to  make one irrevocable separate offer to each holder of the senior subordinated notes to prepay all the senior subordinated notes then held by that holder 
the occurrence of a change of control also constitutes an event of acceleration under the senior subordinated notes 
our outstanding junior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million have automatic rollover provisions  which extend their maturity for an additional year  unless we provide at least seven months advance notice of our intention not to renew at maturity 
labranche co 
llc is entitled to prepay with written consent from the nyse the junior subordinated notes without penalty under the terms of the agreements relating thereto 
below is a table providing future redemption and repayment opportunities with respect to the above described debt pursuant to the terms thereof debt interest rate remaining principal at maturity date first call senior notes due million may  may  first call is at senior notes due million may  may  first call is at senior subordinated notes million june  none will be paid at maturity junior subordinated notes million automatic renewal none requires six month notice or mutual consent of the note holder to redeem total million the million must be paid in june with interest 
the redemption premium is reduced by one half each subsequent may in january and february  we purchased and cancelled million of our outstanding senior notes due and million of our senior notes due in open market transactions 
accordingly  as of march   following the purchases of this indebtedness  our total remaining long term indebtedness was reduced to million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may and million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may on october   pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes  we offered to purchase outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
this offer expired on november   with  principal amount of outstanding senior notes having been tendered 
following the closing of this transaction and the closings of other previous offers to repurchase with immaterial tenders of senior notes  approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding as of december  as a specialist and market maker  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital and liquid assets as promulgated by various regulatory agencies which regulate our business 
as part of our overall risk management procedures for further discussion  refer to part i  item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we attempt to balance our responsibility as specialist  market maker and broker dealer with our overall capital resources 
these requirements restrict our ability to make use of cash and other liquid assets for corporate actions  such as repaying our debt  repurchasing stock or making acquisitions 
as a broker dealer  labranche co 
llc is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c labranche co 
llc is required to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equivalent to the greater of  or 
of aggregate indebtedness  as defined 
nyse rule c also prohibits a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s net capital  as defined  was million  which exceeded the minimum requirements by million 
the nyse generally requires its specialist firms to maintain a minimum dollar regulatory capital amount in order to establish that they can meet  with their own nla  their position requirement 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s nyse minimum required dollar amount of nla  as defined  was million  and its actual nla  as defined  was million 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s minimum required dollar amount of nla  as defined  was million 
labranche co 
llc s actual nla  as defined  was million as of december  labranche co 
llc thus satisfied its nla requirement as of each of those dates 
the minimum required dollar amount of nla fluctuates daily and is computed by adding two components 
the first component is equal to million for each one tenth of one percent 
of the aggregate nyse transaction dollar volume in a cash equities specialist organization s allocated securities  as adjusted at the beginning of each month based on the prior month transaction dollar volume 
the second component is calculated either by multiplying the average haircuts on a specialist organization s proprietary positions over the most recent twenty days by three  or by using an nyse approved value at risk var model 
based on this two part calculation  labranche co 
llc s nla requirement could increase or decrease in future periods based on its own trading activity and all other specialists respective percentages of overall nyse transaction dollar volume 
on july   the sec approved a reduction of the minimum dollar regulatory capital requirement for a specialist in cash equities and increased the requirement for a specialist in etfs 
this reduction was effected in four quarterly installments on september   december   march  and june  after the first installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million  after the second installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million  after the third installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million and after the fourth installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million 
these dividend payments were mainly comprised of the net liquid asset reductions  but also included dividends for excess regulatory capital 
likewise  the final two dividends to us of million and million included an aggregate million effect of using nyx shares instead of cash as regulatory capital 
on september   labranche co 
llc paid to us an additional dividend of million 
this dividend payment was mainly comprised of excess regulatory capital generated from operations 
in february   the sec approved  with immediate effect  an approximate reduction in the required nla that need to be maintained by cash equity specialists to transact business on the nyse by approximately 
this resulted in a reduction of our required nla by approximately million  of which million has been moved to our holding company for other current or future corporate purposes 
pursuant to these nla rules  labranche co llc is entitled to use unrestricted shares of nyx stock as nla  instead of cash for regulatory capital  subject to risk based haircuts 
as a result  labranche co 
llc s nla as of december  included approximately million in nyx shares after the risk based haircuts 
since our nla reduction was implemented in february  the majority of the amended nla requirement can be met by the nyx shares held by labranche co 
llc 
the amended nla requirements enabled labranche co 
llc to declare a dividend distribution of million to us  which was paid in february and march  with cash left at labranche co 
llc as a cushion over and above the nyx shares used to satisfy the continuing nla requirement 
as a registered broker dealer and member firm of the nyse  lfs is also subject to sec rule c  as adopted and administered by the sec and the nyse 
under the alternative method permitted by this rule  the minimum required net capital is equal to the greater of million or of aggregate debit items  as defined 
as of december  and december   lfs net capital  as defined  was million and million  respectively  which exceeded minimum requirements by million and million  respectively 
we reduced the net capital at lfs by million in september to the current million  due primarily to the decrease in our net capital requirement after we outsourced our clearing operations to a major wall street firm in june as a clearing broker dealer  lfs also is subject to sec rule c  as adopted and administered by the sec

failure by any of our broker dealer subsidiaries to maintain its required net capital and nla  where applicable  may subject it to suspension or revocation of its sec registration or its suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the amex and or any other exchange of which it is a member firm 
as evidenced by the foregoing requirements  our broker dealer subsidiaries require a substantial amount of capital 
in particular  even as amended  labranche co 
llc s nla requirement limits our ability to utilize a substantial portion of our liquid assets for other corporate purposes 
as of december   we had a tax receivable of million which mainly relates to a federal nol carryback claim for the tax receivable of million included a pending tax assessment of million as of december  our other liabilities of million reflected on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition are comprised of legal and tax contingencies pursuant to sfas and fin such contingencies are considered long term  as there is no present obligation to pay such liabilities in the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to regulatory requirements that prescribe communication barriers between our broker dealer subsidiaries  we employ different compliance risk management procedures at each such subsidiary 
these risk processes are set forth below our cash equities specialist compliance risk management process because our cash equities specialist activities on the nyse expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the hybrid market helps us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary that is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses and compliance risk 
this risk management process includes participation by our corporate compliance committee  executive operating committee  floor management committee  post managers  floor captains  specialists and chief risk officer 
these parties roles are as follows corporate compliance committee 
labranche co 
llc s corporate compliance committee consists of representatives from executive and senior management  compliance personnel  including our on floor compliance officer  our general counsel  our chief regulatory officer and several additional senior floor specialists  known as post managers 
the role of the corporate compliance committee is to monitor and report to senior management on the statutory and regulatory compliance efforts of our specialist business 
the corporate compliance committee also advises the compliance department in establishing  reviewing and revising our policies and procedures governing labranche co 
llc s regulatory compliance structure 
executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of two executive officers 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for our specialist stocks  after receiving recommendations from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our nyse floor management committee is currently composed of one senior floor manager  six post managers  one wheel manager and one floor administrative personnel manager 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines for each of our specialist stocks 
in determining these procedures and guidelines  the floor management committee considers the recommendations of the floor captains 
the post managers generally meet with their respective floor captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular specialist stocks 
the wheel managers ensure that the floor is adequately staffed at all times 
in addition  post managers  wheel managers and floor captains are always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations reported by a floor captain  and the swat team manager is available to assess and provide assistance on break out  or intense trading situations 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these trading situations as they occur 
our floor management committee also trains other specialists and trading assistants on a regular basis on new rules and or interpretations from the nyse with respect to our specialist obligations and guidelines  with the assistance of our compliance department 
floor captains 
we currently employ four floor captains who monitor the activities of our cash equities specialists throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
the floor captains observe trades and constantly review trading activities on a real time basis 
in addition  the floor captains are readily available to assist our specialists in determining when to deviate from procedures and guidelines in reacting to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the floor captains report these unusual situations and any deviations from these procedures and guidelines to their respective post managers 
floor captains meet with each specialist at least once a week to evaluate each specialist s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines  as well as to review compliance reports generated by the compliance department in monitoring and reviewing specialist trading activities 
floor captains also meet to review risk procedures and guidelines and  if appropriate  make recommendations to the floor management committee 
specialists 
our specialists conduct electronic and  at times  manual auctions of our specialist stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  specialists observe our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create and maintain a fair and orderly market 
specialists promptly notify a floor captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines 
on floor compliance officer 
we also have an on floor compliance officer that monitors the specialists compliance with nyse rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reports his findings and on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity specialist unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provides summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
in addition  we have at least one trading assistant at each post on the nyse floor who is compliance registered and able to review trading activities to monitor compliance with rules 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flow from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
electronic exception reports 
we have implemented a system of electronic rule exception reports at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary to monitor our compliance with nyse and sec rules 
these reports are generated on a daily basis  from one to three days after each trading day  and are the result of significant development efforts from our technology group  with advice of our compliance and legal staff 
our compliance staff reviews these exception reports daily  and in the event an exception is detected  the exception is researched in detail by our on floor compliance officer or another compliance officer to determine if a compliance issue is found 
if a compliance issue is detected  we make an effort to correct the problem and conduct training of our specialists and or distribute compliance bulletins to ensure our specialists understand the rule and processes going forward 
certain detected issues are discussed at monthly compliance committee meetings 
we believe that enhancements we have made to our compliance procedures and guidelines  and on a continuous basis as circumstances warrant  have continued to improve our risk management process 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse has instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market financial risk we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our equity specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give our management  including our chief risk officer  access to specific trading information during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the specialist s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly seek to manage our trading positions relative to existing market conditions 
our equity specialist trading activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses or gains in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks and fulfillment of our specialist obligations 
quantification of such losses or gains would not be meaningful as standard market studies do not capture our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in an immediate reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making risk management process as specialists in options  etfs and futures in our lsh group of entities  we have a responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly market  and trade securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination 
our options  etfs  futures  us government obligations and foreign currency specialist trading exposes us to certain risks  such as price and interest rate fluctuations  volatility risk  credit risk  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
additionally  as a market maker in options  etfs and futures through our lsh group of entities  we also trade as principal 
in our market making function  we bring immediacy and liquidity to the markets when we participate 
our market making activities expose us to certain risks  including  but not limited to  price fluctuations and volatility 
in connection with our specialist and market making activities  we are engaged in various securities trading and lending activities and assume positions in stocks  rights  options  etfs  us government securities  futures and foreign currencies for which we are exposed to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased  which can be directly impacted by volatile trading on the nyse  the amex and other exchanges 
additionally  in the event of nonperformance and unfavorable market price movements  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at a loss 
our traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain etf and options positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
certain members of management  including our chief risk officer  who oversee our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making activities are responsible for monitoring these risks 
these managers utilize a third party software application to monitor specialist and market making positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that our traders operate within the parameters set by management 
furthermore  our aggregate risk in connection with our options  futures and etfs trading is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and our traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
when an unusual or large position is observed by the chief risk officer  he communicates the issue to senior management  who communicate with the trader to understand the strategy and risk management behind the trade and  if necessary  determine avenues to mitigate our risk exposure 
our options  futures and etfs trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  which reduces potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of the options  futures and etfs in our specialist and market making portfolios would have impacted profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the underlying securities move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating this risk  and different methodologies would produce materially different estimates 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss our options  futures and etfs specialist operations would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk interest rate risk in connection with the trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers in connection with our cash equities specialist operations  we are exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies 
thus  a change in a foreign currency exchange rate relative to the us dollar will result in a change in the value of us registered shares in which we are the specialist 
our specialist and market makers trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency exchange rates 
we  therefore  hold various foreign currencies in order to lessen the risks posed by changing foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  lsp trades derivatives denominated in foreign currencies  which creates exposure to foreign currency risk 
the following chart illustrates how the specified movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar to which our specialist and market making activities are exposed would have impacted our profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain assumptions and it does not fully represent the profit and loss exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  security prices  volatility  interest rates and other related factors 
as specialists and market makers in options  etfs and futures  we generally maintain large specialist and market maker positions 
historically  we have been operating in a low and moderate interest rate market 
as such  we may be sensitive to interest rate increases or decreases and or widening credit spreads may create a less favorable operating environment for this line of business 
concentration risk we are subject to concentration risk by holding large positions or committing to hold large positions in certain types of securities 
as of december   our largest unhedged proprietary position is our nyx shares 
this concentration does not arise in the normal course of business 
institutional brokerage risk management process our institutional brokerage activities require that we execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions  whether due to human error or failure of our information or communication systems  could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or us and could subject us to claims for losses 
since june  our customer margin transactions have been executed through a major wall street clearing firm 
these customer margin transactions are financed by the clearing firm based on our instructions 
we are liable to the clearing firm for any losses incurred by the clearing firm in connection with our customers margin transactions 
our past clearing activities through june  included settling each transaction with both the contra broker and the customer 
in connection with our institutional and direct access floor brokerage activities  a transaction was settled either when the customer paid for securities purchased and took delivery  or delivered securities sold for payment 
settling transactions for retail customers and professional investors involved financing the transaction until the customer made payment or  for margin accounts  advancing credit to the customer within regulatory and internal guidelines 
clearing direct access brokers transactions included guaranteeing their transactions to the contra broker on the exchange floor 
these clearing activities may have exposed us to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers were unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it was necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may have been exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements were not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may have incurred in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to our execution and clearance activities was linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
our largest transactions involved those for institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers 
we systematically monitor our open transaction risk in connection with our institutional brokerage activities  starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce risk is taken 
even under our new clearing arrangement with a major wall street firm  credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the depository trust company dtc or the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  senior management that oversees our institutional brokerage operations  in conjunction with the related compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency  although some of this responsibility now is undertaken by our outsourced clearing firm 
operational and technology risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss from external events  and from failures in internal processes or information systems 
in each of our business segments  we rely heavily on our information systems in managing our risk 
accordingly  working in conjunction with the nyse and other exchanges  we have made significant investments in our trade processing and execution systems 
our use of  and dependence on  technology has allowed us to sustain our growth over the past several years 
management members and floor captains at our nyse cash equities specialist operations constantly monitor our positions and transactions in order to mitigate our risks and identify troublesome trends should they occur 
the substantial capital we have invested  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems affords management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions  the various positions of each of our trading professionals  our overall position in a particular stock  and capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate  per specialist or per issue basis 
our information systems send and receive data from the nyse through dedicated data feeds 
the nyse supplies us with specialist position reporting system terminals both on the trading floor and in our offices 
these terminals allow us to monitor our nyse specialist trading profits and losses  as well as our positions 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations utilize a third party software application to monitor our positions and profits and losses on a real time basis 
we internally develop and use significant proprietary trading technologies in our specialist and market making segment in order to enhance our principal trading capabilities and manage risk in the increasingly evolving electronic marketplace 
our trading technologies are developed and maintained by our information technology personnel and their development process is subject to policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of technology design flaws and programming errors 
these policies and procedures include  but are not limited to  policies concerning the techniques and manner by which new or enhanced trading technologies are implemented  segregation of duties among the developers  the quality assurance personnel and the individual who enters new trading technologies into production and  when possible  independent review of these technologies and procedures 
although these  and other  policies and procedures are designed to mitigate the risk of design  coding or other flaws or errors in our current and future trading technologies  we cannot assure you that these policies and procedures will successfully be followed or will timely and effectively detect such flaws or errors 
we have developed and implemented a business continuity plan  which includes a comprehensive disaster recovery plan 
we have a back up disaster recovery center in new york  outside of manhattan as well as redundant trading facilities in london  england and hong kong 
legal and regulatory risk substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cause significant harm to our reputation  which in turn could negatively affect our business prospects 
our registered broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory requirements intended to insure their general financial soundness and liquidity 
these broker dealers are subject to sec rules c  c and other requirements adopted and administered by the sec and the nyse 
the usa patriot act of requires us financial institutions  including banks  broker dealers  futures commission merchants and investment companies  to implement policies  procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism
