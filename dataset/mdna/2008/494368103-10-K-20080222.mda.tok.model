the corporation s products are sold under such well known brands as kleenex  scott  huggies  pull ups  kotex and depend 
the corporation has four reportable global business segments personal care  consumer tissue  k c professional other  and health care 
these global business segments are described in greater detail in item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
in managing its global business  the corporation s management believes that developing new and improved products  responding effectively to competitive challenges  obtaining and maintaining leading market shares  controlling costs  and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the corporation 
the discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors 
product innovation past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation 
the corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership 
in order to introduce new or improved products  the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed 
research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care  tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials 
competitive environment past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our 
table of contents part ii continued principal products in our major markets  both domestically and internationally 
our products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which are typically sold at lower prices 
we have several major competitors in most of our markets  some of which are larger and more diversified 
the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty  product innovation  quality and performance  price  and marketing and distribution capabilities 
aggressive competitive actions in and have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the corporation s products in the market 
we expect competition to continue to be intense in market shares achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance 
we hold number or share positions in more than countries 
achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands 
cost controls to maintain our competitive position  we must control our manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
we have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in our business segments 
our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp  oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes 
our strategic investments in information systems and partnering with third party providers of administrative services should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities 
foreign currency and commodity risks as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we are also exposed to changes in commodity prices 
our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations
