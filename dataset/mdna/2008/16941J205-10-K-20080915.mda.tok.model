introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of china precision steel  inc and our subsidiaries together  the group financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion is organized as follows 
overview of the company s business this section provides a general description of the group s business  as well as recent developments that have either occurred during the fiscal year ended june  and are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition or disclose known trends 
results of operations this section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  this discussion includes a brief description of significant transactions and events that have an impact on the comparability of the results being analyzed 
liquidity and capital resources this section provides an analysis of the group s cash flows for the fiscal year ended june  included in this section is a discussion of the group s outstanding debt and the financial capacity available to fund the group s future commitments and obligations 
overview of the company s business we are a niche and high value added steel processing company principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of high precision cold rolled steel products  in the provision of heat treatment and in the cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips 
we use commodity steel to create a high value added specialty premium steel 
specialty precision steel pertains to the precision of measurements and tolerances of thickness  shape  width  surface finish and other special quality features of highly engineered end use applications 
we produce and sell precision ultra thin and high strength cold rolled steel products ranging from mm to mm 
we also provide heat treatment and cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips not exceeding mm thickness 
our process puts hot rolled de scaled pickled steel coils through a cold rolling mill  utilizing our patented systems and high technology reduction processing procedures  to make steel coils and sheets in customized thicknesses according to customer specifications 
currently  our specialty precision products are mainly used in the manufacture of automobile parts and components  steel roofing  plane friction discs  appliances  food packaging materials  saw blades  textile needles  and microelectronics 
we conduct our operations principally in china through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  shanghai chengtong precision strip company limited  or chengtong  and shanghai blessford alloy company limited  or shanghai blessford  which  in turn  are wholly owned subsidiaries of our direct subsidiary  partner success holdings limited  or pshl 
most of our sales are made domestically in china  however  we began exporting during fiscal and our overseas market currently covers indonesia  thailand  the philippines  nigeria and ethiopia 
we intend to further expand into additional overseas markets in the future  subject to suitable market conditions and favorable regulatory controls 
in the year ended june   we added three indirect subsidiaries to our corporate structure 
on april   we purchased shanghai tuorong precision strip company limited  or tuorong  through pshl 
the sole activity of tuorong is the ownership of a land use right with respect to facilities leased to chengtong 
on april   pshl purchased for nominal consideration blessford international limited  a british virgin islands company 
blessford international limited does not conduct any business  but it owns a single subsidiary  shanghai blessford alloy company limited  that is a wholly foreign owned enterprise chartered in china 
we intend to hold blessford international limited as a shell subsidiary 
we strive to find an appropriate sales mix that provides us with the stability and cash flows  along with the higher margin provided by high precision and individually customized cold rolled steel products 
to meet market demands in our primary market  china  as well as overseas market  there were increased capital requirements as we sought to construct additional rolling mills to accommodate our planned growth 
in addition  our workforce has increased and  in particular  we have faced a growing need for experienced executive and technical staff 
our market is highly competitive  although we have focused on a niche market that we consider allows us to compete effectively as we continue to grow our business 
we also face significant price volatility for raw materials  the hot rolled steel coils  and our financial results may be impacted by changes in the market prices for these materials 
given our size  we do not have the ability to influence the prices at which we must purchase raw materials 
however  the nature of our high value add products enables us to pass on all or part of the price fluctuations in raw materials to our customers 
results of operations fiscal year versus fiscal year net income increased by  or year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   and gross profit increased by  or year on year 
the increase in net income is mainly attributable to the increase in sales during the year  due to increased production capacity 
gross profit 
gross profits in absolute terms increased by  or year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   while gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the increase in gross profits is mainly attributable to a year on year increase in sales revenues in relation to a year on year increase in cost of goods sold 
the decrease in gross profit margin principally resulted from increases of raw material prices during the year 
we passed on the majority of the increased cost to our customers through increases in selling prices 
sales revenues 
sales volume increased by  tons or year on year to  tons for the year ended june  from  tons for the year ended june  and  as a result  sales revenues increased by  or year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  we believe that the increases in sales and sales revenues are a direct result of increases in our capacity and the building of our brand both in china and overseas among users of cold rolled precision steel products 
average cost per unit sold increased to for the year ended june   compared to an average cost per unit sold of for the year ended june   representing an increase of per ton  or  year on year 
the increase in average cost per unit sold is mainly attributable to the increase in raw material prices 
the mm cold roll mill which became operational in october is now operating at approximately of design capacity and is expected to reach its full operating capacity in calendar year sales by product line 
a break down of our sales by product line for the years ended june  and is as follows product category quantity tons amount of sales quantity tons amount of sales year on year qty 
variance low carbon cold rolled low carbon acid wash low carbon hard rolled high carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high end cold rolled sales of scrap metal subcontracting income total there were various changes in the break down of sales among our product categories over the year ended june  as we have been ramping up the capacity of the second mill since october and are in the process of developing new products and new markets 
high carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of  per ton for the year ended june  compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of  for the year ended june   as we continued to see our customers of the high carbon hot rolled products switch to the high carbon cold rolled products 
the low carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june  compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  this is a result of increased production of the low carbon hard rolled steel category  which is our exported precision steel product  from of sales during the year ended june  accounting for  to now of the current sales mix  accounting for  at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june  management continues to take appropriate action to develop new products and optimize our product mix without adversely affecting overall sales volume and margins 
management believes that there are high barriers to entry in the chinese domestic precision cold rolled steel industry because of the level of technology expertise required for operation and that our unique capabilities and know how give us a competitive advantage to grow sales of higher margin products as we continuously carry out r d and strive to launch new products that could potentially lead to new segments  customers and markets 
average selling prices variance low carbon cold rolled low carbon acid wash low carbon hard rolled high carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high end cold rolled subcontracting income the average selling price per ton generated increased to for the year ended june  compared to the corresponding year in of  representing an increase of or year on year 
this increase was due to both changes in our sales mix during the year to focus on high quality high margin products and rising raw material prices

average unit cost of raw materials consumed based on precision products sold was per ton for the year ended june   compared to per ton for the year ended june  the increase in the quantity of raw materials consumed was directly attributable to the increase in sales volume 
manufacturing overhead costs increased by  or year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in depreciation by  or year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   an increase in utilities by  or year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   and an increase in subcontracting fees paid by  or year on year to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  expenses selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or year on year  to  for the year ended june  compared to the corresponding period in of  the increase was mainly attributable to increases in transportation  which rose by  year on year  due to our increased delivery charges of precision steel resulting from a broader customer base  including exports  as well as an increase in the frequency of deliveries 
in response to these rising costs  chengtong has adopted a policy of requiring all new customers to provide for transportation and delivery of goods 
administrative expenses 
administrative expenses increased by  or year on year  to  for the year ended june   compared to the comparable period in this increase was chiefly due to increases in the amortization of intangible assets  listing fees relating to the company s admission to the nasdaq capital market  directors remuneration  and salaries and wages 
the increase in directors remuneration was mainly attributable to the initial distribution of remuneration to two directors of pshl totaling  increases in salaries and wages were principally due to increases in the average number of chengtong staff 
finance costs 
net finance cost increased year on year as a result of increases in total interest expense by  for  compared to  for  as the finance costs for the year ended june  included interest expenses for the loan dated september  for the full year 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we will continue to meet these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity financing  and bank debt 
current assets 
current assets increased significantly by  or year on year to  as of june   from  as of june  principally as a result of increases in cash and equivalents by  or year on year  accounts receivable by  or year on year  and net advances to suppliers by  or year on year

inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
we generally manufacture our products to match orders from our customers 
due to the specialized nature of our products  we are able to purchase raw materials based upon customer orders 
this operating model allows us to effectively pass along fluctuations in the price of raw materials to our customers 
for commonly used raw materials  we purchase larger quantities when we believe prices are likely to increase in the short term in order to minimize the impact of any such price increase

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to several types of market risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes nor do we make use of derivative instruments to hedge the risks discussed below 
the following sections provide quantitative information on our exposure to market risks 
our use of sensitivity analyses are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 
foreign currency exchange rates the group collects revenues from operations principally in the chinese renminbi 
except for limited exports to thailand and the philippines  all of our local sales revenues are collected in and substantially all of its expenses are paid in the chinese renminbi 
we face foreign currency rate translation risk when chengtong s results are translated to us dollars  as well as foreign currency rate transaction risk with respect to sales outside of china and with respect to financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
our results of operations denominated in foreign currency are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the market rate of exchange ruling at that date 
the registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution 
the chinese renminbi had remained stable against the us dollar at approximately yuan to us dollar for several years and it was not until july  that the chinese currency regime was altered  with a revaluation versus the united states dollar 
this move initially valued the renminbi at per united states dollar 
in addition  the renminbi is no longer linked to the us currency but rather to a basket of currencies with a margin of fluctuation 
however  there remains international pressure on the chinese government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy and as of june  the exchange rate was renminbi to us dollar 
the exchange rate of renminbi is subject to changes in china s government policies which are  to a large extent  dependent on the economic and political development both internationally and locally and the demand and supply of renminbi in the domestic market 
there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will continue to remain stable in the future amongst the volatility of currencies  globalization and the unstable economies in recent years 
since i our income and profit are mainly denominated in renminbi  and ii the payment of dividends will be in us dollars  if any  any exchange fluctuation of the renminbi against other foreign currencies would adversely affect the value of the shares and dividends payable to shareholders  in foreign currency terms 
at june   the group s outstanding financial instruments with foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure had an aggregate fair value of million including the group s non us dollar denominated debt 
the potential increase in the fair values of these instruments resulting from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million at june  interest rates the group is subject to interest rate risk on its non derivative financial instruments 
the group does not hedge its interest rate risk 
at june   the group s total bank debt outstanding was  all of which was interest bearing 
substantially all of the bank debt was floating rate debt with interest rates which vary with changes in the standard rate set by the people s bank of china 
a change in the interest rate or yield of fixed rate debt will only impact the fair value of such debt  while a change in the interest rate of floating rate  or variable rate  debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt 
to the extent interest rates increase  we will be liable for higher interest payments to its lenders
