net earnings for were up to million  or per diluted share 
record revenues of million  up over  and efficiency gains drove operating profit improvement of to million  excluding the gain on the sale of our maple grove facility of million pretax million after tax or per diluted share 
results also benefited from a lower effective tax rate resulting from net one time tax benefits 
these benefits were partially offset by the charge associated with the third quarter restructuring action 
as previously disclosed  we completed the anticipated sale of our maple grove  minnesota facility during the fourth quarter of all operations previously residing in this facility were integrated into our other north american facilities to enable greater efficiencies in conjunction with our manufacturing footprint consolidation initiative 
a net tax benefit of million  or per diluted share was recognized in the third quarter of the benefit related to the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
this benefit was partially offset by the impact of tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions on deferred taxes 
management approved a restructuring action during september in an effort to better match skill sets and talent in evolving functional areas that are critical to successful execution of strategic priorities as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these actions impacted approximately positions within a workforce of  or about two percent of the employee base 
the restructuring action resulted in the recognition of a pretax charge of million or per diluted share in these costs consist primarily of severance  outplacement benefits and recruiting expenses and are included within selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
these actions were substantially complete as of december  during  we launched initiatives aimed at consolidating our global footprint  expanding our presence in china and establishing global sourcing capabilities 
through these initiatives  we expect to broaden our global sourcing capabilities  reduce product costs and improve operating efficiencies over the next three to five years 
during  in support of these strategic initiatives  we incurred approximately million of costs 
as we exit  our north american manufacturing footprint consolidation initiative is complete 
our china facility is manufacturing two products for local and worldwide distribution  with another product platform ready for production in early our global sourcing initiative contributed over million in savings during  allowing us to maintain our gross margin in despite rising material costs and investment in these initiatives 
we also successfully doubled the percentage of materials and components sourced from low cost regions from approximately in to in tennant continues to invest in innovative product development  with of net sales spent on research and development in we launched five new products which targeted all of our markets during sales of new products introduced in the past three years generated approximately our equipment sales during  exceeding our target of 
in october  we introduced a breakthrough new cleaning technology  echo tm that cleans using electrically activated tap water 
we will begin global shipments of machines equipped with the echo technology  which will initially be available on six walk behind scrubbers  during the second quarter of in addition  we expect to launch to new products in that will take us into new market space and further enhance our product portfolio 
we ended with a debt to capital ratio of and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we generated operating cash flows of million during shareholders equity increased by to million  as compared to during  we repurchased million in tennant stock under our share repurchase program 
current challenges facing tennant include cost increases for raw materials and other purchased components due to rising commodity costs which are mitigated by selling price increases and cost reduction activities 
we expect to continue to see volatility in commodity prices driving increases in our cost of commodity based components in the relative strength or weakness of the global economies in may also impact demand for our products and services in the markets we serve 
tennant achieved solid performance during despite a softening in north american macro economic indicators during the year 
however  as both global and regional economies are unpredictable and somewhat volatile  we continue to monitor macro economic indicators closely 
lastly  our results continue to be impacted by changes in value of the us dollar primarily against the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound  the japanese yen and the chinese yuan 
to the extent the applicable exchange rates weaken relative to the us dollar  the related direct foreign currency exchange effect would have an unfavorable impact on our results 
if the applicable exchange rates strengthen relative to the us dollar  our results would be favorably impacted

we use economic profit as a key indicator of financial performance and the primary metric for performance based incentives 
economic profit is based on our net operating profit after taxes less a charge for the net assets used in the business 
the key drivers of net operating profit we focus on include net sales  gross margin and operating expenses 
the key drivers we focus on to measure how effectively we utilize net assets in the business include accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and capital expenditures 
these key drivers are discussed in greater depth throughout management s discussion and analysis 
net sales in  consolidated net sales of million increased from consolidated net sales were million in  an increase of from in  growth was driven by increases in all geographic regions and all product categories

in  north american net sales increased to million compared with million in growth in net sales was driven by volume increases in all product categories and price increases 
organic growth accounted for the volume increases in service  parts and consumables sales  while the volume growth in equipment sales was primarily driven by the continued success of new products 
growth in specialty surface coatings also contributed to the increase in north america net sales as compared to europe european net sales in increased to million compared to net sales of million 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased european net sales by approximately in our hofmans and floorep acquisitions contributed million  or approximately to europe s net sales 
europe s organic base was essentially flat in when compared to shipment of a large non recurring order in for which a similar shipment did not occur in and lower sales of equipment in the united kingdom offset volume growth from our hofmans line of outdoor products during the second half of and benefits from price increases

we implemented a selling price surcharge during the fourth quarter on certain products including batteries and battery operated equipment in north america 
price increases on similar products in europe were implemented during the third quarter 
the benefits from our global sourcing initiative along with these pricing actions allowed us to nearly fully mitigate the impact of rising material costs during gross margins in were also impacted by positive direct foreign currency exchange effects and a favorable mix of products sold  which offset costs associated with our manufacturing footprint consolidation  china expansion and the integration of the hofmans acquisition 
gross profit margin declined percentage points to in compared to price increases taken earlier in the year and manufacturing cost reduction actions were not enough to offset higher material costs and expenses associated with the startup of our china facility and our manufacturing footprint consolidation 
future gross profit margins could continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and other product components  competitive market conditions  the mix of products both within and among product lines and geographies  and foreign currency exchange effects

selling and administrative expenses s a expenses increased by million  or  in compared to s a expenses included a million charge for a restructuring action approved by management during the third quarter as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the charge consisted primarily of severance and outplacement benefits 
the impact of foreign currency translation on s a expenses was approximately million in the remaining approximate increase in s a expenses was due in part to investments associated with expanding our international market coverage  the inclusion of expenses of acquired operations and recruiting expenses associated with filling restructured positions and other openings

increases in sales incentives and warranty expenses driven primarily by growth in net sales and higher levels of marketing expenses for new product launches also contributed to the increase in s a expenses over the prior year 
additional costs due to the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired operations of hofmans  costs to support expansion in china and international growth initiatives further increased our s a expenses in comparison to lastly  s a expenses include the impact of recognizing stock option expense associated with the adoption of sfas no

gain on sale of facility as discussed above  we completed the anticipated sale of our maple grove  minnesota facility during the fourth quarter of for a net pretax gain of million 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was a result of lower interest rates and lower average levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during compared to interest income  net was million in  an increase of million from the increase was primarily a result of higher interest rates and higher average levels of cash and cash equivalents invested 
other income expense  net total other income increased million between and net foreign currency exchange gains decreased million between and due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
esop income increased million between and due to a higher average stock price 
the company benefits from esop income when the shares held by the company s esop plan are utilized as the basis of those shares is lower than the current average stock price 
this benefit will end when we issue the last of the shares held by the esop which is anticipated to occur on december  the change in other expense  net of million between and was primarily due to an increase in discretionary contributions to tennant s charitable foundation 
the million change in other income expense  net between and was primarily due to contributions made to the tennant foundation during that were not repeated in  increased esop income due to a higher average stock price in than and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was substantially related to a favorable one time tax benefit associated with the reversal of a valuation allowance  net of the impact of tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions on deferred taxes 
these items were partially offset by an increase in taxes due to the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
in the decrease in the effective tax rate was substantially related to a refund from a state tax protective claim and the release of tax reserves accrued in prior years 

table of contents the third quarter of included a favorable one time discrete item of million related to the reversal of a german valuation allowance  net of the impact of tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions on deferred taxes 
during the third quarter of it was determined that it was now more likely than not that a tax loss carryforward in germany will be utilized in the future and accordingly the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset was reduced to zero 
during and  we had a favorable impact from the extraterritorial income exclusion act eti act  a us tax law  of approximately on our effective tax rate 
on october   the american jobs creation act of was signed into law  which phased out the eti act tax benefit during and in addition  the new law established a manufacturing deduction for profits on us manufactured product to be phased in through for  these changes resulted in an increase in our effective tax rate of slightly more than one percentage point 
for  we expect the change in the us tax law will have a similar impact 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be between and 
this rate may vary based on changes in mix of taxable earnings by country and our ability to utilize the available foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources during  our financial condition remained strong 
our debt to capital ratio was as of december   compared with as of december  our capital structure was comprised of million of current debt  million of long term debt and million of shareholders equity as of december  as of december   we had an available committed line of credit totaling million 
we also had stand alone letters of credit of approximately million outstanding as of december  there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities and we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  on june   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  national association  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  bmo capital markets financing  inc and us bank national association  as co documentation agents and the lenders from time to time party thereto

the credit agreement contains customary representations  warranties and covenants  including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and to merge or consolidate with another entity 
further  the credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as of the end of each quarter of not greater than to  and to maintain an ebitda to interest expense ratio of no less than to the credit agreement also restricts us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock in an amount that exceeds million during any fiscal year if  after giving effect to such payments  our leverage ratio would exceed to the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in february  we completed the acquisition of one foreign based company and announced that we had signed a purchase agreement to acquire a second foreign based company 
we used a combination of available cash and the credit agreement to fund the acquisition that closed and intend to use a combination of available cash and the credit agreement to fund the other acquisition which has not yet closed 
on february   we amended the credit agreement to increase the sublimit on foreign currency borrowings from million to the aggregate amount of the commitment and to increase the sublimit on borrowings by the foreign subsidiaries from million to million 
on august   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with bank of america  national association which expires in august this credit facility is denominated in renminbi rmb in the amount of million rmb  or approximately million us dollars  and is available for general corporate purposes  including working capital needs of our china location 
the interest rate on borrowed funds is equal to the people s bank of china s base rate 
this facility also allows for the issuance of standby letters of credit  performance bonds and other similar instruments over the term of the facility for a fee of of the amount issued 
the balance outstanding on this facility was million us dollars at december  at a rate of 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   down from million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  we did not have any short term investments as of december  cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million as of december  as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed 
our current ratio was as of december  and  based on working capital of million and million  respectively 
if the global economy deteriorates  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products and  as a result  our operating cash flow 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  present capital resources and available financing sources are more than sufficient to meet our cash requirements for

certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions  which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value 
of those leases that contain residual value guarantees  the aggregate residual value at lease expiration is million  of which we have guaranteed million 
as of december   we have recorded a liability for the fair value of this residual value guarantee of million 
our retirement benefit plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
our plan obligations totaled million as of december  contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have applied the provisions of eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas no 
as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table

cash requirements operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in in  cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by strong net earnings as well as an increase in net income taxes payable prepaid  partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses 
the decrease in employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses was primarily a result of decreases in performance based compensation 
cash flow from operations decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily driven by decreased income taxes payable prepaid and decreased employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses 
in  cash provided by operating activities was impacted by strong net earnings and an increase in non cash share based compensation expense  an increase in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses 
the increase in share based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the inclusion of stock option expense under sfas no 
r in and an increase in expense associated with performance share and restricted stock awards 
the increases in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses were attributable to higher accruals for volume based incentives and warranty  an increase in payroll 
table of contents accruals as well as timing of payments 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were an increase in receivables driven by higher fourth quarter sales volumes and an increase in inventory 
the increase in inventory was in support of new product launches and the addition of our manufacturing facility in china 
as discussed previously  two metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and days inventory on hand dioh  on a fifo basis 
these metrics for the years indicated were as follows in days dso dioh dioh increased one day in compared to this increase is mainly due to higher inventory levels at our foreign locations due to longer lead times and pipeline fill for new products 
inventory grew at the same pace as demand during as compared to resulting in no change in the dioh

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded and adjusted as a part of our cycle counting and physical inventory procedures 
the reserve amount is based on historical loss trends  historical physical and cycle count adjustments as well as inventory levels 
changes in the reserve result from the completed cycle counts and physical inventories 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
we also establish reserves for uncertain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we consider our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  based on management s judgment  to the extent we believe that recovery is less likely than not  we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against foreign tax loss carryforwards

shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
for additional information about factors that could materially affect tennant s results  please see our other securities and exchange commission filings  including disclosures under risk factors in this document 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement  and investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this matter in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and in other written statements we make from time to time 
it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel  oil  gas  lead and other commodities 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
increases in worldwide demand and other factors affect the price for lead  steel and related products 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel or batteries in excess of near term production requirements 
as a result  increases in the price of lead or steel can significantly increase the cost of our lead and steel based raw materials and component parts 
during  our raw materials and other purchased component costs  such as batteries  were unfavorably impacted by commodity prices and we were not able to fully mitigate these higher costs with selling price increases and cost reduction actions 
we will continue to focus on mitigating the risk of continued future raw material or other product component cost increases through product pricing  negotiations with our vendors and cost reduction actions 
the success of these efforts will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market and our ability to achieve cost savings 
if the commodity prices remain at their current levels or continue to increase  our results may be unfavorably impacted in foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound  the japanese yen and the chinese yuan against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because our products are currently manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
other matters management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
