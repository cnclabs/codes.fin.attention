item a 
risk factors the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product innovations  economic growth  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes and economic conditions 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel 
a reduction in air travel would reduce orders for new aircraft and reductions in cabin upgrades by airlines for which we supply products and for the sales of spare parts  thus reducing our sales and profits 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all 
we are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the near future 
as with any new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market 
as is customary for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer 
if a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write off all or a part of the inventory  accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program 
a write off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements 
this could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bond debt 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
the loss of a major customer or a significant reduction in sales to a major customer would reduce our sales and earnings 
in we had a concentration of sales to a major customer representing of our sales 
the loss of this customer or a significant reduction in sales to this customer would significantly reduce our sales and earnings 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts  which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented of our sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located in the united states and canada 
any of these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims under customer contracts 
contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
we depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be fully funded or may be terminated  and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
if we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results  our stock price could decline significantly 
our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including delays or cancellations of programs 
it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly

we operate four principal facilities located in new york state  new hampshire  washington state and quebec  canada 
we serve the three primary aircraft markets which are the military  commercial transport and the business jet markets 
in  the break down of sales to the commercial transport market  the military market and the business jet market were  and  respectively  miscellaneous sales to non aerospace markets accounted for of sales 
astronics strives to offer comprehensive lighting and electrical systems for aircraft which we believe make the company unique in our ability to serve our customers 
on february   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of the general dynamics airborne electronic systems aes business unit from a subsidiary of general dynamics 
astronics acquired the business for million in cash 
the company financed the acquisition and related costs by borrowing million on its revolving line of credit and used million of cash on hand 
during the fourth quarter of we broke ground on a  square foot expansion to our east aurora  new york facility 
the cost of the building was approximately million exclusive of manufacturing equipment which is being acquired as needed 
we financed the project and equipment purchases relating to the expansion with a million tax exempt bond offering during the first half of this expansion provides additional production capacity allowing for continued growth 
the bond will be repaid over years beginning in we began utilizing the space during the third quarter of key factors affecting astronics growth are our ability to have our products designed into the plans for new aircraft  the rate at which new aircraft are produced  government funding of military programs  and the rates at which aircraft owners  including commercial airlines  refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft 
once designed into a new aircraft  the spare parts business is frequently retained by the company 
astronics strategy is to increase the amount of content on aircraft platforms  evolving the company from our historic role of a components supplier to a turn key provider of complete systems 
we provide cabin electronics and cabin lighting to the commercial transport market  this is our largest market 
the february acquisition of astronics aes increased our footprint in the commercial transport market to the point where sales to this market represent approximately of our total revenue in compared with prior to the acquisition 
from to we saw our revenue from the commercial transport market increase from million to million a compound annual growth rate 
this was largely led by our cabin electronics products which provide in seat power for passengers and power to in flight entertainment systems 
we do not expect this rate of growth in the future 
we continue to believe that this market is strong and will remain strong provided the commercial transports continue to improve their financial positions and the global economy remains strong 
we continue to see many retrofit opportunities in this market including inquiries from many of the north american airlines 
there were a number of factors that contributed to the rapid growth of the past few years 
years of under investing by the airlines created significant pent up demand for cabin upgrades 
from until roughly commercial airlines around the world invested very little in terms of upgrading their cabin interiors and took delivery of few new aircraft 
beginning in  the asian airlines began to invest in upgrading their cabins  adding more in seat power and in flight entertainment systems and demand for our products grew 
this combined with the introduction of better in seat power technology and our market leading position relative to our competition created an unusually steep growth curve for us through going forward we expect there will continue to be retrofit opportunities around the world  however  predicting if and when these airlines choose to install our products is difficult 
additionally we expect next generation aircraft such as the airbus a and the boeing will be equipped with more in seat power than the older aircraft which they will be replacing 
this will provide us with an opportunity to compete for that work 
we estimate that our market share for our cabin electronics products to be about 
continued growth will depend not only on growth of the overall market but our ability to either sustain or increase market share and continued development of our teaming arrangements with major in flight entertainment suppliers 
cabin electronics products  which are principally sold to the commercial transport market  accounted for of our sales in and of our sales in another market we serve is the business jet market 
in we saw volume and average ship set value increase in the business jet market as business jet airframe manufacturers production increased 
the cessna mustang exterior and cockpit lighting and eclipse exterior  cockpit and power distribution very light jets vlj entered production and illuminated cockpit display panel assembly deliveries increased to piaggio for the avanti ii 
we anticipate production for each of these platforms to increase in in we were selected to provide exterior lighting and cockpit lighting controllers for the embraer phenom jet that is expected to begin production in we will provide similar parts for the phenom which is expected to begin production in we continue to see a wide range of opportunities to employ our technology in the business jet markets 
there is risk involved in the development of any new aircraft 
we are encouraged to see the vlj market continue to develop but it is not without risk 
much of the demand for the vlj market is expected to be driven by the start up air taxi industry 
overall  we believe that the vlj market will develop and we are positioning ourselves to participate having won work on key programs such as the cessna mustang  embraer phenom  phenom and the eclipse our military market sales are typically comprised of several significant programs such as the power converter for the tactical tomahawk and taurus missiles and the v osprey  complemented by many spare part orders covering many aircraft platforms 
over the past several years we have been developing the exterior lighting suite for the f joint strike fighter 
this aircraft is expected to enter low rate production in and we are in the process of negotiating a contract to support the low rate production phase of the program 
the military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year 
risks are that overall spending may be reduced in the future and that specific programs may be eliminated 
astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will cause material financial loss 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years regarding this market 
each of the markets that we serve is presenting opportunities that we expect will provide continued growth for the company over the long term 
we continue to look for opportunities in all three markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions 
in we expect to see our revenue grow approximately 
we are projecting revenues to be about million 
the aerospace market continues to be strong with many quality opportunities for us to pursue 
airframe manufacturers have record backlogs representing several years of production which we expect will result in continued demand for our products provided the global economy maintains its strength 
continuing ramp up in production of some platforms such as the cessna mustang and eclipse will be tempered by fairly flat sales to the commercial transport market and military markets 
despite the slow down in year over year growth expected in as compared with the past year we still see many opportunities for long term growth and expect to continue investing in developmental programs to push our capabilities 
in the commercial transport market  our largest and fastest growing market during the past few years  we expect our revenue in will be flat with revenue due to the timing of cabin upgrade programs which impacts our cabin electronics sales 
from to sales to the commercial transport market grew by compounded annually  principally driven by large cabin up grade programs 
the nature of these programs is such that they tend to have choppy revenue and booking streams 
forecasting if and when the upgrades will take place is difficult 
while there are still significant opportunities for cabin upgrades  particularly in north america  we expect that if these opportunities are converted to bookings  revenue from these programs would likely occur in the latter part of and beyond 
beyond we expect that the next generation of commercial transports such as the boeing and airbus a will be equipped with more in seat power and in flight entertainment than the aircraft they are replacing 
we expect this will provide a significant opportunity for us 
in we expect our sales to the business jet market to provide most of the growth for the company as airframe manufacturers delivery of new aircraft increases as compared with there are a number of new high quality opportunities we expect will be presented to us during the year that we will be prepared to invest in 
we expect that our engineering and development costs will increase during as compared with last year to over million as compared with million in challenges facing us include improving shareholder value through profitability 
increasing profitability is dependent on many things such as increased build rates for existing aircraft  market acceptance and economic success of new aircraft such as the cessna mustang and eclipse business jets  continued government funding of defense programs such as the f joint strike fighter and v osprey and the company s ability to obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for these programs 
in addition we are faced with continued increasing health care and corporate governance costs  particularly those required by sarbanes oxley legislation 
many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology 
we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific aircraft development programs 
we will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating efficiencies and focusing on executing on the growth opportunities currently in front of us 
finally  demand for our products is driven by the discretionary spending of aircraft owners and airlines and new aircraft build rates 
a weakening economy would likely result in reduced demand for our products  lowering our profitability 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note of
