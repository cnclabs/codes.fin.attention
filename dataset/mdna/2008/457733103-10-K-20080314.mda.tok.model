item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with products  potential competition associated with our product candidates and retention of key employees 
in order for one of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  or our collaborative partners  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
these risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on numerous factors 
we launched azasite in august and began recording product revenue in the third quarter of the effectiveness of our ability and the ability of third parties on which we rely to help us manufacture  distribute and market azasite  physician and patient acceptance of azasite  competitor response to the launch of azasite  discounts  pricing and coverage on governmental and commercial formularies  are all factors  among others  that will impact the level of revenue recorded for azasite in subsequent periods 
our co promotion revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies  over which we have limited or no control  and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
our co promotion revenues are impacted by the number of governmental and commercial formularies upon which restasis and elestat are listed  the discounts and pricing under such formularies  as well as the estimated and actual amount of rebates  all of which are managed by allergan 
other factors that are difficult to predict and that impact our co promotion revenues are the extent and effectiveness of allergan s sales and marketing efforts as well as our own sales and marketing efforts  coverage and reimbursement under medicare part d and medicaid programs  and the sales and marketing activities of competitors  among others 
revenues related to development activities are dependent upon the progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors 
cost of sales as they relate to azasite contain variable and fixed cost components  and the variable components will increase or decrease depending on the volume of azasite sold 
in addition  certain of these variable costs included in cost of sales are subject to annual increases which are generally out of our control 
research and development expenses  including expenses for development milestones  drug synthesis and manufacturing  preclinical testing and 
table of contents clinical research activities  depend on the ongoing requirements of our development programs  completion of business development transactions  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of research and development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing  basic research activities  and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to commercialize our products 
once again  management may in some cases be able to control the timing and magnitude of these expenses 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs related to the commercialization of azasite 
in addition  we have incurred and may incur additional general and administrative expenses as we work to resolve our current stockholder litigation and sec investigation 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing prescription pharmaceutical products for diseases in the ophthalmic and respiratory allergy areas 
our goal is to build and commercialize a sustainable pipeline of innovative new treatments based upon our technical and scientific expertise 
our ophthalmic products and product candidates are currently concentrated in the allergic conjunctivitis  bacterial conjunctivitis  dry eye disease and glaucoma indications 
our respiratory allergy product candidates are currently concentrated in the treatment of respiratory complications of cystic fibrosis and allergic rhinitis indications 
in february  we signed an exclusive licensing agreement with insite vision for the us and canadian commercialization rights of azasite for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis 
in april  azasite was approved by the fda for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children one year of age and older 
in august  we launched azasite in the united states and are promoting it to select eye care professionals  pediatricians and primary care providers 
in  we began co promoting restasis for the treatment of dry eye disease and we launched elestat for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis 
under agreements with allergan  we receive co promotion revenue based upon allergan s net sales of these products 
prior to  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to the discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as the establishment of strategic partnerships and our revenues consisted of payments under our various corporate partnerships established for the development and commercialization of our products  if approved 
see part i item business of this report for a full discussion of our agreements with insite vision  allergan and other significant collaborative agreements  as well our other product candidates in clinical development 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenue from sales of azasite  restasis and elestat did not exceed our total operating expenses in we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock  debt  and with revenue from corporate partnerships  including co promotion revenue 
we operate as a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis  as situations change and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  recognition of revenue from product co promotion is affected by certain estimates and judgments made by allergan on which we rely when recording this revenue 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  taxes  clinical trial  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other service liabilities 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we record all of our revenue from sales of azasite  product co promotion activities  and collaborative research agreements in accordance with sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
sab no 
states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenues we recognize revenue for sales of azasite when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment  with the exception of transactions whereby product stocking incentives were offered approximately one month prior to the product s august  launch 
in the united states  we sell azasite to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to pharmacies and federal  state and commercial healthcare organizations 
accruals  or reserves  for estimated rebates  discounts  chargebacks and other sales incentives collectively  sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in sales of azasite 
these sales incentive reserves are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  which states that cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price of the vendor s product or services and therefore should be characterized as a reduction of the revenue recognized in the vendor s income statement 
sales incentive accruals  or reserves  are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or claimed on the sales of azasite 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and experience  and forecasted customer buying patterns 
amounts accrued or reserved for sales incentives are adjusted for actual results and when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate 
for the year ended december   we reserved approximately  for sales incentives  which reduced azasite product sales revenue 
in addition to sab no 
 our ability to recognize revenue for sales of azasite is subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  or sfas no 
 as issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
sfas no 
states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product will be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
customers will be able to return short dated or expired azasite that meet the 
table of contents guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
our return goods policy generally allows for returns of azasite within an month period  from six months prior to the expiration date and up to months after the expiration date  but may differ from customer to customer  depending on certain factors 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we are required to estimate the level of sales that will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy and to record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales of azasite in determining our net sales 
future estimated returns of azasite are based primarily on the return data for comparative products and our own historical experience with azasite 
we also consider other factors that could impact sales returns of azasite 
these factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated remaining shelf life  price changes of competitive products  and current and projected product demand that could be impacted by introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products  among others 
for the year ended december   we reserved approximately  for potential returns of azasite  which reduced azasite product sales revenue 
immediately preceding the launch of azasite  we offered wholesalers stocking incentives that allowed for extended payment terms  product discounts  and guaranteed sale provisions collectively  special terms 
these special terms were only offered during a specified time period of approximately one month prior to the august  launch of azasite 
any sales of azasite made under these special term provisions were accounted for using a consignment model since substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership did not transfer upon shipment 
under the consignment model  we did not recognize revenue upon shipment of azasite purchased with the special terms  but recorded deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  less all appropriate discounts and rebates  and accounted for azasite inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory 
we recognized the revenue from these sales with special terms at the earlier of when the inventory of azasite held by the wholesalers was sold through to the wholesalers customers or when such inventory of azasite was no longer subject to these special terms 
at december   we had net deferred revenue of  related to sales of azasite considered consignment 
all sales subsequent to this specified launch time period include return rights and pricing that are customary in the industry 
we utilize data from external sources to help us estimate our gross to net sales adjustments as they relate to the sales incentives and recognition of revenue for azasite sold under the special term provisions 
external sourced data includes  but is not limited to  information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers as well as data from ims health  a third party supplier of market research data to the pharmaceutical industry 
we also utilize this data to help estimate and identify prescription trends and patient demand  as well as product levels in the supply chain 
product co promotion revenues we recognize co promotion revenue based on net sales for restasis and elestat  as defined in the co promotion agreements  and as reported to us by allergan 
we actively promote both restasis and elestat through our commercial organization and share in any risk of loss due to returns and other allowances  as determined by allergan 
accordingly  our co promotion revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies over which we have limited or no control and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
allergan recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the co promotion agreements provide for gross sales to be reduced by estimates of sales returns  credits and allowances  normal trade and cash discounts  managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs as defined in the agreements  all of which are determined by allergan and are outside our control 
we record a percentage of allergan s net sales for both restasis and elestat  reported to us by allergan  as co promotion revenue 
we receive monthly net sales information from allergan and perform analytical reviews and trend analyses using prescription information that we receive from ims health 
in addition  we exercise our audit rights under the contractual agreements with allergan to annually perform an examination of allergan s sales records of both restasis and elestat 
we make no adjustments to the amounts reported to us by allergan other than reductions in net sales to reflect the incentive programs managed by us 
we offer and manage certain incentive programs associated with elestat  which are utilized by us in addition to those 
table of contents programs managed by allergan 
we reduce revenue by estimating the portion of allergan s sales that are subject to these incentive programs based on information reported to us by our third party administrator of the incentive programs 
for fiscal years  and  the amount of rebates associated with our incentive programs in each year was less than one half of one percent of our co promotion revenues 
the rebates associated with the programs we manage represent an insignificant amount  as compared to the rebate and discount programs administered by allergan and as compared to our aggregate co promotion revenue 
under the co promotion agreement for elestat  we are obligated to meet predetermined minimum calendar year net sales target levels 
if the annual minimum is not satisfied  we record revenues using a reduced percentage of net sales based upon our level of achievement of predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
amounts receivable from allergan in excess of recorded co promotion revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
we achieved our annual net sales target level during the three month period ended june  collaborative research and development revenues we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner have met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
we recognize revenue from our research and development service agreements ratably over the estimated service period as related research and development costs are incurred and the services are substantially performed 
upfront non refundable fees and milestone payments received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the services are substantially performed 
this period  if not defined in the collaborative agreement  is based on estimates by management and the progress towards agreed upon development events as set forth in our collaborative agreements 
these estimates are subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee or revenue related to ongoing research and development services is modified on a prospective basis 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon the achievement of agreed upon development events that are substantively at risk by our collaborative partners or us 
this collaborative research revenue is recognized upon the achievement and acknowledgement of our collaborative partner of a development event  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner or is reasonably assured 
accordingly  our revenue recognized under our collaborative research and development agreements may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of collaborative research revenue 
no collaborative research revenue was recognized for the years ended december  or inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out ie  fifo method 
cost includes materials  labor  overhead  shipping and handling costs 
our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and provide valuation reserves for any estimated obsolete  short dated or unmarketable inventories 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand  expected market conditions and the expiration dates or remaining shelf life of inventories 
as of december   we recorded a  reserve for potential overstocking 
taxes we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  against all potential tax assets due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide clinical  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
we monitor all significant research and development  manufacturing  sales and marketing and other service activities and the progression of work related to these activities 
we estimate the underlying obligation for each activity based upon our estimate of the amount of work performed and compare the estimated obligation against the amount that has been invoiced 
because of the nature of certain contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
we record the larger of our estimated obligation or invoiced amounts for completed service 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimate 
stock based compensation expense as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  which requires us to measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
upon adoption  we implemented the modified prospective method in recognizing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of our awards 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
prior to  we used a blended volatility calculation utilizing volatility of peer group companies with similar operations and financial structures in addition to our own historical volatility 
in  we began using only our own historical volatility as a basis for determining expected volatility 
the estimation of share based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
significant management judgment is required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility  forfeitures and expected life to be used in the valuation of the options 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in this section of the report as well as note stock based compensation for additional discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our costs of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in revenue of approximately million  or  was primarily due to increased co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis  as compared to  as well as initial product revenue from sales of azasite  which we launched in august total revenues in included the recognition of a development milestone of million for diquafosol tetrasodium from santen in accordance with our development  license and supply agreement 
product sales  net product sales of azasite  net of rebates and discounts  for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to none for the same period in beginning in july  we started receiving and processing orders for azasite as part of the initial stocking of the supply chain in preparation of the august launch 
these initial orders were offered with special terms as stocking incentives for wholesalers 
the special terms were only offered for a specified period of time of approximately one month prior to the august  launch of azasite 
sales with these special terms are being accounted for using the consignment model  which requires that we defer revenue until such time that the product is resold further into the supply chain or the product is no longer subject to the special terms 
as of december   we had deferred azasite revenue  net of estimated rebates and discounts  of approximately  sales made subsequent to this specified launch time period include return rights that are customary in the industry 
for these orders  we are recording revenue at the date of shipment  when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership has transferred to the customer 
prior to the launch of azasite  we created a managed care group to establish relationships with wholesalers  commercial managed care organizations  state medicaid agencies  and medicare managed care organizations to secure access and reimbursement for azasite 
we expect that we will continue to increase overall access and reimbursement as these organizations review azasite during the course of their normal review cycles 
for the period from launch to december   there were approximately  prescriptions written for azasite  based on prescription data from ims health 
we expect that azasite will exhibit a slight seasonal trend similar to other products in the bacterial conjunctivitis market  with a slight decline in sales during the summer months when children are typically out of school 
product co promotion co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the same period in  and approximately million for the same period in the increase in co promotion revenue for restasis of approximately million  or  as compared to  was primarily due to increased patient usage of restasis  resulting in an increase of prescriptions year over year due to selling and promotion efforts  including direct to consumer dtc advertising  an annual price increase in the first quarter of  and the final scheduled increase on the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we were entitled 
restasis is currently the only approved prescription product indicated for dry eye disease 
the increase in co promotion revenue for restasis of approximately million  as compared to  was primarily due to increased patient usage of restasis  based on the increase of prescriptions year over year  a price increase during the first quarter of  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of physicians prescribing restasis 
in addition  in april there was a scheduled increase of the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we were entitled 

table of contents all of our revenue from restasis is based on worldwide net sales of restasis according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
however  less than of our co promotion revenue from restasis is derived from sales of restasis outside of the united states 
restasis  in terms of prescription volume  has grown significantly since it was first launched in april total prescriptions  as reported by ims health  were approximately million  million and million for the months ended december   and  respectively 
this represents year over year prescription volume increases of  and for the months ended december   and  respectively 
our entitled percentage of net sales of restasis increased a final time in april for the year ended december   co promotion revenue from restasis represented approximately of our total co promotion revenue  as compared to approximately in and approximately in we expect that this trend will continue in and future reporting periods 
for the year ended december   allergan recorded approximately million of revenue from net sales of restasis  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the same period in  and approximately million for the same period in the increase in co promotion revenue for elestat was primarily due to a reduction in rebates and discounts as a result of changes in elestat coverage under governmental and commercial health plans  combined with a price increase for elestat that became effective during the first quarter of these factors increased our average price per prescription in as compared to the increase in revenue was offset by a decline in market share for elestat due to an increasingly competitive market environment as well as an overall decline in the allergic conjunctivitis market in terms of prescriptions 
the increase in co promotion revenue for elestat of approximately million  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in the market share of elestat  a price increase for elestat that became effective during the first quarter of  as well as an overall increase in the us allergic conjunctivitis market  defined by branded prescription  topically applied products to treat allergic conjunctivitis 
all of our revenue related to elestat is from net sales in the united states according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
elestat is a seasonal product with product demand mirroring seasonal trends for topical allergic conjunctivitis products 
typically  demand is highest during the spring months followed by moderate demand in the summer and fall months 
the lowest demand is during the winter months 
competition from the introduction of a new branded product and a new generic caused a decline in market share for elestat 
based upon national prescription data from ims health  for the year ended december   elestat prescriptions represented approximately of the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  as compared to approximately in  and approximately in based on current trends in prescriptions for elestat  we expect our market share to remain relatively constant with based upon monthly data from ims health  the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  in terms of prescriptions  decreased approximately for the year ended december  and increased approximately and approximately for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the previous year 
in regards to co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat  we are entitled to an escalating percentage of net sales based upon predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
during a fiscal year  we recognize product co promotion revenue associated with targeted net sales levels for elestat achieved during that time period and defer revenue in excess of the sales level achieved 
we achieved the annual  and net sales target level for elestat during the three month period ended june th in each of these fiscal years 
since the beginning of when medicare part d became effective  there has been a decrease in prescriptions for elestat reimbursed by state medicaid programs which has been partially offset by an increase of prescriptions reimbursed under medicare part d plans and  to a lesser extent  commercial plans 
this shift to medicare part d plans has resulted in reduced rebates compared to those under medicaid programs 
on an annual 
table of contents basis  allergan negotiates for coverage under states medicaid programs and coverage under commercial and medicare programs 
to date  the increasing competitive environment and price discounting has resulted in elestat losing coverage under state medicaid plans  however  the loss to our co promotion revenue has been minimal due to the large price concessions associated with these particular plans 
future loss of coverage under additional states or commercial plans may have a negative impact on our co promotion revenue 
the commercial marketing exclusivity period for elestat provided under the hatch waxman act will expire on october   at which time competitors will be able to submit to the fda an anda or a b application for a generic version of epinastine hcl ophthalmic solution 
we cannot predict the time frame for fda review of such applications  if any 
we are aware that several generic pharmaceutical companies have expressed intent to commercialize the ocular form of epinastine after the commercial exclusivity period expires 
our ability to gain additional intellectual property protection related to elestat has been  and continues to be  challenging 
we cannot provide any assurance that any form of intellectual property protection covering elestat will be possible in the united states after the expiration of the commercial exclusivity period under the hatch waxman act on october  if a generic form of elestat is introduced into the market  our agreement with allergan to co promote elestat will no longer be in effect  and our revenues attributable to elestat will essentially cease 
loss of our co promotion revenue from elestat will materially impact our results of operations and cash flows 
in march  santen completed its phase clinical trial testing of diquafosol tetrasodium in japan  which entitled us to receive a milestone payment of million 
santen is responsible for all development  regulatory submissions  filings and approvals  and the commercialization of potential products in japan and nine other asian countries 
we could receive additional development milestone payments from santen of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of diquafosol tetrasodium  if the product candidate is approved for commercialization in santen s licensed territories 
in  santen began phase clinical trials in japan for a multi dose formulation of diquafosol tetrasodium  and in january  announced that it plans to file an application for marketing approval with regulators in japan during the july to september time frame 
our future revenue will depend on various factors including the effectiveness of our commercialization of azasite and continued commercial success and duration of commercial exclusivity of restasis and elestat 
in addition to the foregoing  pricing  rebates  discounts and returns for all products  the effect of competing products  coverage and reimbursement under commercial or government plans  and seasonality of sales of elestat will impact future revenues 
if allergan significantly under estimates or over estimates rebate amounts  there could be a material effect on our revenue 
in addition to the continuing sales of azasite  restasis and elestat  our future revenue will also depend on our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements  and to achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements  as well as whether we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates 
cost of sales cost of sales related to the sales of azasite  which was launched in august  were approximately million for the year ended december  since azasite was launched in august  we had no cost of sales in or cost of sales expense consists of variable and fixed cost components 
variable cost components include the cost of azasite inventory sold  changes to our inventory reserve for overstocking or short dated material  distribution  shipping and logistic service charges from our third party logistics provider and royalties to insite vision on net sales of azasite 
these variable cost components will increase or decrease depending on the volume of azasite sold 
fixed cost components are predominately the amortization of the million approval milestone that we paid insite vision as part of our licensing agreement 
royalties owed to insite vision related to the deferred portion of sales of azasite have also been deferred and will be recognized as cost of sales as the revenue related to such sales is able to be recognized 
certain costs included in cost of sales are subject to annual increases which are out of our control 
for instance  our royalty rate to insite vision on net sales of azasite will increase from to in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of we expect that cost of sales will increase in relation to  but not proportionately to  the expected increases in revenue from sales of azasite 
costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to approximately million incurred related to azasite  which included a million upfront licensing fee payment upon the execution of the agreement with insite vision in which we acquired the exclusive right to commercialize azasite in the united states and canada 
research and development expenses associated with our other product candidates were approximately million for the year ended december  and were primarily associated with advancing our programs for denufosol for cystic fibrosis  epinastine nasal spray for allergic rhinitis  glaucoma and prolacria for dry eye disease 
see part i item business of this report for a detailed development status of these programs 
the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to the development activities associated with our epinastine nasal spray program for seasonal allergic rhinitis  including the payment of a million up front licensing fee and the initiation of phase clinical trials  the in licensing of bilastine  for which we paid an upfront licensing fee of million in november  and performing preclinical research and filing an ind for ins in our glaucoma program 
in addition  we had increased costs associated with our denufosol for cystic fibrosis program  relating to the initiation of the phase tiger clinical trial  as well as increased costs related to our ins antiplatelet program  which was subsequently discontinued in the third quarter of these cost increases were partially offset by decreased spending on our prolacria program as we continued our discussions with the fda regarding the future of this program and the discontinuation of certain other programs 
research and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research costs  clinical trial insurance  upfront license fees  milestone and royalty payments relating to research and development  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in preclinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length of the clinical trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude or scope of our clinical  preclinical and research activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
year over year spending on active development programs can vary due to the differing levels and stages of development activity  the timing of certain expenses and other factors 
accordingly  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period

selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  resulted from an overall increase in various expenses primarily associated with the launch activities related to azasite  including the expansion of our sales force and creation of our managed care group  as well as marketing and promotional activities 
additionally  we incurred a general increase in annual salaries  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year december   as compared to  resulted from an overall increase in promotional activities  primarily the increased costs associated with our sales force including increased salary  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 

table of contents our commercial organization currently focuses its promotional efforts on approximately  select pediatricians  primary care physicians  eye care professionals and allergists for azasite  restasis and elestat 
our selling and marketing expenses include all direct costs associated with the commercial organization  which include our sales force and marketing programs 
our sales force expenses include salaries  training and educational program costs  product sample costs  fleet management and travel 
our marketing and promotion expenses include product management  promotion  advertising  public relations  phase clinical trial costs  physician training and continuing medical education and administrative expenses 
we adjust the timing  magnitude and targeting of our advertising  promotional  phase clinical trials and other commercial activities for our products based on seasonal trends and other factors  and accordingly  these costs can fluctuate from period to period 
we have started a variety of comprehensive phase programs related to azasite in order to obtain additional scientific data related to its pharmacokinetic profile  anti microbial effects  anti inflammatory effects  and safety and efficacy in other ocular conditions such as lid margin disease 
the costs for these phase clinical trials will be reflected in our selling and marketing expenses and could fluctuate from period to period 
future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that immediately precede and follow product launches  including the periods following our august launch of azasite 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to products  our selling and marketing expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to lower legal and administrative expenses as a result of reduced legal defense activities associated with our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  combined with reimbursement of certain legal costs covered under our insurance policies 
legal fees  excluding amounts reimbursed  were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in the decrease in legal costs was partially offset by a general increase in annual salaries  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to significantly increased legal and administrative expenses associated with our stockholder litigation and sec investigation and to a lesser extent increased salary and personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  business development activities and overall corporate growth 
legal fees were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality compliance  facilities and information systems 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level of our future research and development and commercialization activities  as well as the level of legal and administrative expenses incurred to resolve our sec investigation and stockholder litigation and the extent to which these legal expenses are reimbursed by insurance 
see litigation and sec investigation described elsewhere in this report 
other income expense other income  net was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in other income fluctuates from year 
table of contents to year based upon fluctuations in the interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances and realized gains and losses on investments offset by interest expense on debt and capital lease obligations 
the decrease in other income of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately million  primarily associated with borrowing million in december and additional borrowings of million during under our term loan facility 
the increase in other income  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from a portfolio mix of higher yielding investments during  and a general increase in the short term interest rate environment 
future other income will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return and change in fair market value on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock 
we also currently receive co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis and elestat  and began receiving product revenue from net sales of azasite in the third quarter of we do not expect our revenue to exceed our operating expenses 
at december   we had net working capital of approximately million  an increase of approximately million from approximately million at december  the increase in working capital was principally due to net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock to warburg in july as well as net borrowings of million from our term loan facility 
these increases were offset by million in milestone payments related to azasite  and funding of normal operating expenses associated with commercialization activities and the development of product candidates 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in investments  which are considered available for sale 
on july   we completed a sale of preferred stock with warburg pursuant to which we sold  shares of our exchangeable preferred stock to warburg at a price per share of  for gross proceeds of million 
the exchangeable preferred stock was exchangeable for shares of common stock at a ratio of we incurred approximately million of issuance costs in connection with the sale of the exchangeable preferred stock 
on october   we held a special meeting of stockholders at which the proposed exchange of all outstanding exchangeable preferred stock for shares of our common stock was approved  thereby authorizing the exchange of these preferred shares to  shares of common stock 
additionally  due to the exchange for common stock  there is no dividend obligation associated with the preferred stock 
these newly issued shares of common stock are classified on our balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
we filed a form s registration statement to register the shares  which was declared effective in january the exchangeable preferred stock was accounted for in accordance with eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and eitf  application of issue to certain convertible instruments 
the difference between the effective conversion price per share of underlying common stock in the exchange provision and the market value per share of common stock as of the closing date of the exchangeable preferred stock transaction resulted in the recording of an embedded contingent beneficial conversion feature  which is required to be treated as a non cash deemed dividend to preferred stockholders 
upon the stockholders approval on october   the contingency was resolved and the exchangeable preferred stock was immediately converted to common stock  resulting in full accretion of the beneficial conversion feature 
the calculated value of the beneficial conversion feature was approximately million and was credited to additional paid in capital upon resolution of the contingency in the quarter ended december  due to the absence of retained earnings  the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as a debit to additional paid in capital 

table of contents in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement in order to obtain debt financing of up to million to fund in licensing opportunities and related development 
in june  we amended the loan and security agreement to enable us to draw upon a new supplemental term loan facility in the amount of million 
we have borrowed the full million under the term loan facility of which million was outstanding as of december  the net borrowings bear interest at a weighted average rate of 
we make principal and interest payments on a monthly basis after a six month interest free period following each advance  and all loan advances made under the agreement have a final maturity date in march see note debt notes to financial statements described below for further discussion regarding the term loan facility 
on february   we signed an exclusive license agreement with insite vision for us and canadian commercialization of azasite  a treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis 
in conjunction with this license agreement  we paid insite vision an upfront license fee of million 
on april   azasite was approved by the fda for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis 
in conjunction with the fda approval  we paid insite vision an additional million milestone 
the million milestone has been capitalized and is being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the patent coverage 
in addition  we are obligated to pay insite vision a royalty for the first two years of commercialization and a royalty thereafter on net sales of azasite in the united states and canada 
our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our development programs  the commercial potential and success of our products  the costs related to the commercialization of azasite and our other products  the costs related to the potential fda approval of our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the level of required administrative and legal support  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  the commercial potential of our product candidates  unreimbursed legal and administrative costs associated with resolving and satisfying any potential outcome of our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and any expansion of facility space 
financial guidance based upon current azasite  restasis and elestat trends  we expect to record aggregate revenue in the range of million and expect total operating expenses to be in the range of million 
cost of sales  which includes the amortization of the azasite approval milestone and royalty obligations to insite vision  is expected to be in the range of million and is included as a component of total operating expenses 
total estimated selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses are estimated to be in the range of million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses associated with the further development of our product candidates are estimated to be in the range of million 
due to our planned promotional and commercialization efforts for elestat and azasite as well as the timing of our anticipated development activities  we expect that our operating expenses will be greater in the first quarter of as compared to the remainder of the year 
included within our operating expenses guidance are projected stock based compensation costs of approximately million 
this estimate is based on the unvested portion of stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december   our current stock price  and an anticipated level of share based payments granted during should our stock price or strategy change significantly from its current level or plan  and or if our anticipated headcount or level of share based payments changes  actual stock based compensation expense could change significantly from this projection 
our actual financial results will be highly dependent on the commercialization of azasite  as well as the clinical and regulatory developments and corporate plans for our denufosol  prolacria  epinastine nasal spray  and glaucoma programs 
our ability to remain within our operating expense target range is subject to multiple factors including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand the magnitude or scope of existing development 
table of contents programs  the need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  commercial success of our products and product candidates  unanticipated professional fees or settlements associated with our stockholder litigation or sec investigation and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
cash utilization in is expected to be in the range of million and incorporates million of principal repayment on our outstanding debt 
based on current operating plans  we expect our cash and investments to provide liquidity through our liquidity needs will largely be determined by the commercial success of our products and key development and regulatory events 
in order for us to continue operations substantially beyond we will need to successfully increase revenues  obtain additional product candidate approvals  which would trigger milestone payments to us  out license rights to certain of our product candidates  pursuant to which we would receive income  raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources  reduce spending on one or more research and development programs and or restructure operations 
additionally  we currently have the ability to sell approximately million of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants from an effective shelf registration statement which we filed with the sec on march  the loan and security agreement that we entered into in december  as amended in june  contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain certain levels of liquidity based on our cash  investment and account receivables balances  as well as negative covenants that may limit us from assuming additional indebtedness and entering into other transactions as defined in the agreement 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our loan and security agreement 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various agreements that create contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations at december  included operating and capital leases of million  long term borrowings of million  interest payments of million  and purchase obligations and other commitments  as further described below 
as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
in addition  we have manufacturing  promotion and clinical responsibilities and activities associated with the commercialization of azasite 
based on these requirements and activities  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase obligations with various clinical research organizations  promotion and advertising agencies  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product for clinical and commercial use as well as with others 
these financial commitments  which totaled approximately million as of december   are reflected as purchase obligations in the table below and include both cancelable and non cancelable arrangements 
since many of these commitment amounts are dependent upon variable components of the agreements  actual payments and the timing of those payments may differ from management s estimate 
the terms of our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require that we make cash payments contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones and up to an additional million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the commercial success of our approved products and future annual product sales levels 
if certain of our product candidates are approved by the fda and are subsequently commercialized  we will be obligated to pay royalties on net sales of the commercialized products 
see part i item business collaborative agreements of this report for a full discussion of our royalty obligations under our in licensing agreement with boehringer ingelheim for our epinastine nasal spray product candidate 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to insite vision as part of our in licensing agreement for azasite 
under the terms of 
table of contents the agreement  our obligation to pay royalties to insite vision is subject to pre determined minimum annual royalty payments 
the determination of whether or not we will owe any such payments is based upon the amount of royalties accrued over a month royalty period 
there are five successive month minimum royalty periods  the first of which commences on october  we have also engaged legal counsel to represent us in our sec investigation and stockholder litigation  but we are not contractually obligated to incur future costs under the applicable engagement letters 
however  we do anticipate future unreimbursed costs to be incurred to retain counsel until these proceedings are resolved 
because of the nature of the situation  we are unable to estimate any future commitment in regards to these legal proceedings and have not included any committed costs in our projected contractual commitment disclosures 
the table below reflects contractual and potential obligations as of december   but does not reflect obligations entered into in some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors as previously described 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table in thousands payment due by period as of december  contractual and potential obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations debt obligations interest on capital lease and debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual license payments development milestone obligations minimum royalties and sales milestone obligations total includes estimated payments of  for cancelable portion of fleet vehicles under a master lease agreement 
see note  commitments and contingencies for a full discussion 
purchase obligations reflect all contractual obligations  including amounts that are cancelable  under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our balance sheet as of december  includes million of other long term liabilities as recorded on our balance sheet as of december  development and sales milestone obligations represent potential amounts payable by us contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
litigation on february   the first of five identical purported shareholder class action complaints was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina against us and certain of our senior officers 
each complaint alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and securities and exchange commission rule b  and focused on statements that are claimed to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  prolacria 
each complaint sought unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from june  through february  
table of contents on march   following consolidation of the lawsuits into a single civil action and appointment of lead plaintiffs  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint  or cac 
the cac asserts claims against us and certain of our present or former senior officers or directors 
the cac asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b based on statements alleged to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of prolacria  and also adds claims under sections  a and of the securities act of the cac also asserts claims against certain parties that served as underwriters in our securities offerings during the period relevant to the cac 
the cac seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from may  through february  in may  the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their claims against the underwriters on the basis that they were time barred 
on june   we and other defendants moved that the court dismiss the cac on the grounds that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and does not satisfy the pleading requirements under applicable law 
on may   magistrate judge eliason  to whom the district court had referred the motion  issued a recommendation that the district court grant defendants motion to dismiss the cac 
plaintiffs filed objections to this recommendation in which they argued that the district court should not accept the recommendation  and defendants responded to plaintiffs objections 
on july   the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina accepted the magistrate judge s recommendation and granted our and the other defendants motion and dismissed the cac with prejudice 
on august   the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
plaintiffs filed their opening appellate brief on november  we and the other defendants filed an opposition brief on january  plaintiffs filed their reply on february  we will continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
as with any legal proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these lawsuits  nor can a reasonable estimate of the amounts of loss  if any  be made 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
we have various insurance policies related to the risk associated with our business  including directors and officers insurance 
however  there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance companies will cover all the matters claimed

sec investigation on august   the sec notified us that it is conducting a formal  nonpublic investigation which we believe relates to our phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  prolacria 
on october   we received a wells notice letter from the staff of the sec  issued in connection with this investigation 
our chief executive officer and our then executive vice president  operations and communications  also received wells notices 
the wells notices provide notification of the sec staff s determination that it intends to recommend to the sec that it bring a civil action against us and the two officers regarding possible violations of section a of the securities act of  sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and sec rules b  b  a  a  a  and a thereunder 
under the process established by the sec  we and the two officers have the opportunity to respond in writing to the wells notice before the staff makes any formal recommendation to the sec regarding what action  if any  should be brought by the sec 
we and the officers receiving these notices provided written submissions to the sec in response to the wells notices during december  and have since had further meetings with sec staff and have provided and will be providing further written submissions to the sec staff 
we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of this investigation  nor can a reasonable estimate of the costs that might result from the sec s investigation be made 
responding to this investigation will result in a

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and borrowings under our term loan facility 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investment portfolio may consist of a variety of securities  including united states government and government agency obligations  money market and mutual fund investments  municipal and corporate notes and bonds and asset or mortgage backed securities 
our investment portfolio as of december  consisted solely of corporate notes and bonds and had an average maturity of less than months  using the stated maturity or reset maturity dates associated with individual maturities as the basis for the calculation 
our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio  changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
in  mortgage backed securities referencing sub prime consumer mortgages experienced a significant increase in default rates  resulting in devaluation of asset prices and reduction in market liquidity 
we reduced our exposure to such additional market risk and associated credit risk by eliminating our investments in mortgage backed and auction rate securities during our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to future capital leases and other short term debt obligations we may incur in our normal operations 
the interest rates on our long term debt borrowings under the term loan facility are fixed and as a result  interest due on borrowings are not impacted by changes in market based interest rates 
however  assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates from the fixed rate on our debt generally results in a decrease in the fair value of our long term debt  and a decrease in interest rates generally results in an increase in the fair value of our long term debt 
however  neither an increase nor a decrease in interest rates will impact the carrying value of the long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of our long term debt borrowings approximate their carrying value of million 
strategic investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we have a strategic investment in parion sciences  inc valued at  as of december  this investment is in the form of unregistered common stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the investment 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our transactions occur in us dollars and we do not have subsidiaries or investments in foreign countries 
therefore  we are not subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk 
we do  however  have foreign currency exposure with regard to the purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredients as they relate to azasite  which is manufactured by a foreign based company 
we have established policies and procedures for market risk assessment  including a foreign currency hedging program 
as of december   we did not have any material foreign currency hedges
