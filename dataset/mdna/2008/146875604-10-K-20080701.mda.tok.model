the holding company is headquartered in new york  new york 
the holding company conducts business as a unitary savings and loan holding company  and the principal business of the holding company consists of the operation of its wholly owned subsidiary  carver federal 
carver federal was founded in to serve african american communities whose residents  businesses and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial services 
the bank remains headquartered in harlem  and predominantly all its ten branches and ten stand alone atm centers are located in low to moderate income neighborhoods 
many of these historically underserved communities are now experiencing unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes  ethnicity and economic opportunity  after decades of public and private investment 
today  carver federal is the largest african american operated bank in the united states 
the bank remains dedicated to expanding wealth enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and financial advice for consumers  businesses and non profit organizations  including faith based institutions 
a measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the bank s outstanding rating  awarded by the office of thrift supervision following its most recent community reinvestment act examination in the examination report noted that of carver s loan originations were within low to moderate income geographies  which far exceeded peer institutions 
the bank has approximately million in assets as of march  and employs approximately employees as of may  carver federal engages in a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services 
carver federal provides deposit products including demand  savings and time deposits for consumers  businesses  and governmental and quasi governmental agencies in its local market area within new york city 
in addition to deposit products  carver federal offers a number of other consumer and commercial banking products and services  including debit cards  online banking including online bill pay  and telephone banking 
through its affiliation with merrill lynch co 
merrill lynch  carver federal offers a comprehensive range of wealth management products 
carver federal offers loan products covering a variety of asset classes  including commercial and residential mortgages  construction loans and business loans 
the bank finances mortgage and loan products through deposit operations or borrowings 
funds not used to originate mortgages and loans are invested primarily in us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the bank s primary market area for deposits consists of areas currently served by its ten branches 
the bank s branches are located in the brooklyn  manhattan and queens boroughs of new york city 
the neighborhoods in which the bank s branches are located have historically been low to moderate income areas 
however  the shortage of housing in new york city  combined with population shifts from the suburbs into the city  has contributed to stimulate significant real estate and commercial development in the bank s market area 
the bank believes that the demographics of its primary market area are changing as a result of the increase in real estate development in recent years 
the expected change in income demographics supports the bank s strategy to provide commercial banking products and  through its affiliation with merrill lynch co  wealth management products 
the bank s primary lending market includes bronx  kings  new york and queens counties in new york city  and lower westchester county  new york 
although the bank s branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions  the bank is facing increased competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas 
management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of the improving economic conditions in the bank s market area and an increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions fulfillment of their responsibilities under the community reinvestment act cra 
the bank s competition for loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  and savings institutions 
the bank s most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings institutions and credit unions 
competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds  corporate and government securities funds  and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
many of the bank s competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products 
at times  these larger financial institutions may offer below market interest rates on mortgage loans and above market interest rates for deposits 
these pricing concessions combined with competitors larger presence in the new york market add to the challenges the bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near term profitability 
carver federal s long history in its market area  its community involvement and relationships  targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking  help the bank compete with other competitors that have entered its market 
in addition  carver federal has successfully competed with larger financial institutions in a number of competitions for government grants and other awards 
in june  carver federal won a million new markets tax credit nmtc award 
that amount compared favorably with awards won by us based global financial institutions 
carver federal believes its strong lending and community financial literacy platforms position the bank well to compete for awards under this and other programs designed to expand financial services in markets served by carver federal 

table of contents the nmtc award is used to stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating revitalization of the community 
the nmtc award provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
the credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment 
during the seven year period  assuming the bank meets compliance requirements  the bank will receive a tax credit on the amount it invests directly in nmtc qualifying projects over each of the first three years  and over each of the next four years 
implementation of the bank s nmtc award began in december when the bank invested million  one half of its million award 
in december  the bank invested an additional million and transferred rights to million to an investor in a nmtc project 
as a result  the bank s nmtc allocation has now been fully invested 
the company expects to receive additional nmtc tax benefits of on the million directly invested  or approximately million  over the next six years

table of contents one to four family residential lending 
traditionally  carver federal s lending activity has been in part the origination and purchase of loans secured by first mortgages on existing one to four family residences  although no one to four family loans were purchased in fiscal carver federal originates and purchases one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts that usually range between  and million 
approximately of the one to four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at march  were adjustable rate and approximately were fixed rate 
beginning in fiscal  carver federal shifted its efforts from primarily originating and purchasing one to four family residential loans to originations and participations in more profitable non residential and construction real estate loans 
one to four family residential real estate loans increased million to million or of the gross loan portfolio at march  compared to march  carver federal s one to four family residential mortgage loans are generally for terms of years  amortized on a monthly basis  with principal and interest due each month 
residential mortgage loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms 
these loans customarily contain due on sale clauses that permit the bank to accelerate repayment of a loan upon transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property 
also  borrowers may refinance or prepay one to four family residential loans at their option without penalty 
the bank s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price  with private mortgage insurance required on loans with ltv ratios in excess of 
under certain special loan programs  carver federal may originate and sell loans secured by single family homes purchased by first time home buyers where the ltv ratio may be up to 
carver federal s fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale 
from time to time the bank has sold such loans to the federal national mortgage association fnma  the state of new york mortgage agency sonyma and other third parties 
loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to sonyma where the sale is made with servicing released 
carver federal uses several servicing firms to sub service mortgage loans  whether held in portfolio or sold with the servicing retained 
at march   the bank  through its sub servicers  serviced million in loans for fnma and million for other third parties 
carver federal offers one year  three year  five one year and five three year adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans are generally retained in carver federal s portfolio although they may be sold in the secondary market 
they are indexed to the weekly average rate on one year  three year and five year us treasury or federal home loan bank fhlb securities  respectively  adjusted to a constant maturity usually one year  plus a margin 
the rates at which interest accrues on these loans are adjustable every one  three or five years  generally with limitations on adjustments of two percentage points per adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of a one year adjustable rate mortgage and four percentage points over the life of three year and five year adjustable rate mortgages 
the retention of adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio helps reduce carver federal s exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable rate loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers 
although adjustable rate loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest earning assets to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds 
adjustable rate loans increase the bank s exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates  although decreases in the bank s cost of funds would tend to offset this effect 
as of march   the bank was finalizing plans to outsource its residential one to four family mortgage origination operations 
we expect this arrangement will expand our product base and improve customer service  while reducing costs to the company 
multifamily real estate lending 
traditionally  carver federal in part originates and purchases multifamily loans  although no multifamily loans were purchased in fiscal rates offered on this product are considered to be competitive with flexible terms that make this product attractive to borrowers 
multifamily property lending entails additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
for example  such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multifamily residential units 
carver federal s multifamily loan portfolio decreased million in fiscal  or to million  of carver federal s gross loan portfolio at march  carver federal s multifamily product guidelines generally require that the maximum ltv not exceed based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio dscr of at least on multifamily loans  which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment 
carver federal originates and purchases multifamily mortgage loans  which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a   or year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years  or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for two additional five year periods 
the bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms 

table of contents to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multifamily real estate loans  carver federal employs a loan risk rating system 
all commercial real estate loans are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
in addition  to evaluate changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of multifamily real estate loan relationships of  to million  and at least semi annually prepares a written report for all relationships exceeding million 
summary reports are then reviewed by the internal asset review committee for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
non residential real estate lending 
carver federal s non residential real estate lending activity consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office  mixed use properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial  retail and church buildings in its market area 
non residential real estate lending entails additional risks compared with one to four family residential and multifamily lending 
for example  such loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property 
carver federal s maximum ltv on non residential real estate mortgage loans is generally based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a dscr of at least on non residential real estate loans 
the bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants leases in the mortgaged property  which serves as additional security for the mortgage loan 
at march   non residential real estate mortgage loans totaled million  or of the gross loan portfolio 
this balance reflects a year over year increase of million  which is consistent with the bank s objective of investing in higher yielding loans 
historically  carver federal has been a new york city metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches 
at march   loans to churches totaled million  or of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
these loans generally have five  seven or ten year terms with  or year amortization periods and a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a ltv ratio 
the bank provides construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction 
there are currently church loans in the bank s loan portfolio 
loans secured by real estate owned by faith based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church s congregation  repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including reviewing the organization s financial condition  limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans 
the bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization  the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis of the church to determine its ability to service the proposed loan 
carver federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and or key person life insurance on the pastor of the congregation 
the bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church s leadership 
asset quality in the church loan category has been strong throughout carver federal s history 
management believes that carver federal remains a leading lender to churches in its market area 
construction lending 
the bank originates or participates in construction loans for new construction and renovation of churches  multifamily buildings  residential developments  community service facilities and affordable housing programs 
carver federal also offers construction loans to qualified individuals and developers for new construction and renovation of one to four family  multifamily  mixed use and commercial real estate in the bank s market area 
the bank s construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the bank s mortgage loans on existing properties 
the loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed 
participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding 
construction terms are usually from to months 
the construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds 
borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the bank s permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property 
carver federal has established additional criteria for construction loans to include an engineer s plan and cost review on all construction budgets with appropriate interest reserves for loans in excess of  construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long term financing on improved and occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the mortgaged property s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could result in project delays and cost overruns 
if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of such loan 
the ability of a developer to sell developed lots or completed dwelling units will depend on  among other things  demand  pricing  availability of comparable properties and economic conditions 
the bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in the bank s market areas  limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans and imposing a stricter ltv ratio requirement than that required for one to four family mortgage loans 

table of contents at march   the bank had million net of million of committed but undisbursed funds in construction loans outstanding  comprising of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
the balance at march  reflects a million  or  increase over fiscal  consistent with the bank s objective of investing in higher yielding loans 
purchased construction loans represent of total construction loans in portfolio 
the bank s primary source of construction loan purchases is with community preservation corporation  a private not for profit corporation sponsored by more than commercial banks  savings institutions and insurance companies that provides mortgage  construction and other lending for housing needs with the goal to revitalize low and mixed income communities 
business loans 
carver federal s small business lending portfolio  excluding the discount to fair market value at acquisition  increased by million to million or of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
carver federal provides revolving credit and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately million to million in manufacturing  services and wholesale segments 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   carver federal s board of directors the board authorized the bank to provide back up liquidity for highly rated us corporate commercial paper borrowers with a minimum short term debt rating of a p cp back up 
as of march   the bank had entered into two cp back up facilities  one for million with a aaa rated us corporate borrower and one for million with an a rated us corporate borrower 
the facilities are not expected to be drawn as they provide alternate liquidity to the borrowers 
the bank is paid a commitment fee for this product 
consumer and other loans 
at march   the bank had million in consumer and other loans  or of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
at march   million  or  of the bank s consumer loans were unsecured loans  consisting of consumer loans other than loans secured by savings deposits  and million  or  were secured by savings deposits 
consumer loans generally involve more risk than first mortgage loans 
collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
further  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against carver federal  and a borrower may be able to assert claims and defenses against carver federal which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
in underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards  carver federal considers the borrower s credit history  an analysis of the borrower s income  expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral 
the underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral 
see asset quality non performing assets 
loan processing 
carver federal s loan originations are derived from a number of sources  including referrals by realtors  builders  depositors  borrowers and mortgage brokers  as well as walk in customers 
loans are originated by the bank s personnel who receive a base salary  commissions and other incentive compensation 
all real estate  business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the bank s lending department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in carver federal s loan policy 
the underwriting and loan processing for residential loans is initiated internally but undergoes subsequent review by an outsourced third party provider for loans with ltv ratios greater than that require private mortgage insurance 
a commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multifamily and non residential properties which the bank finances 
prior to loan approval  the property is inspected by a loan officer 
as part of the loan approval process  consideration is given to an independent appraisal  location  accessibility  stability of the neighborhood  environmental assessment  personal credit history of the applicant s and the financial capacity of the applicant s 
business loan applications are completed for all business loans 
most business loans are secured by real estate  personal guarantees  and or guarantees by the united states small business association sba or uniform commercial code ucc filings 
the loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant  collateral  cash flows and purpose and stability of the business 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant s income and credit standing 
it is the bank s policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the bank 
it is carver federal s policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances 
borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and  when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the department of housing and urban development  paid flood insurance policies must be obtained 
most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis  together with each payment of principal and interest  to a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance 
written conformation of the guarantee for sba loans and evidence of the ucc filing is also required 
loan approval 
except for real estate and business loans in excess of million and million  respectively  mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the bank s board to the board s asset liability and interest rate risk committee 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee has delegated to the bank s management loan committee  which consists of certain members of executive management  loan approval authority for loans up to and including million for real estate loans  million for business loans secured by real estate and million for all other business loans 
all one to four family mortgage loans that conform to fnma standards and limits may be approved by the residential mortgage loan underwriter 
any loan that represents an exception to the bank s lending policies must be ratified by the next higher approval authority 
real estate and business loans above million and million  respectively  must be approved by the full board 
purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans 

table of contents loans to one borrower 
under the loans to one borrower limits of the united states office of thrift supervision ots  with certain limited exceptions  loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the maximum loans to one borrower under this test would be million and the bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit 
loan sales 
originations of one to four family real estate loans are generally made on properties located within the new york city metropolitan area  although carver federal occasionally funds loans secured by property in other areas 
all such loans  however  satisfy the bank s underwriting criteria regardless of location 
the bank continues to offer one to four family fixed rate mortgage loans in response to consumer demand but requires that such loans satisfy applicable secondary market guidelines of either fnma  sonyma or other third party purchaser to provide the opportunity for subsequent sale in the secondary market as desired to manage interest rate risk exposure 
loan originations and purchases 
loan originations  including originated for sale  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these loan origination results in fiscal and fiscal can be attributed to strong market conditions and the bank s commitment to maintain and increasing its market share 
during fiscal  in order to supplement its origination efforts  carver federal purchased a total of million of mortgage loans  consisting of performing construction and non residential mortgage loans 
this represented of carver federal s purchases and originations of its loan portfolio during fiscal the bank purchases loans in order to increase interest income and to manage its liquidity position 
the bank continues to shift its loan production emphasis to take advantage of the higher yields and better interest rate risk characteristics available on business loans  multifamily and non residential real estate mortgage loans  including those in construction  as well as to increase its participation in multifamily and non residential real estate mortgage loans with other new york metropolitan area lenders 
loans purchased decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to the bank s focus on origination of higher yield loans 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to carver federal s loan originations  purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended march in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent loans originated one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer total loans originated loans purchased total loans originated and purchased loans sold net additions to loan portfolio comprised of personal and credit card loans 
comprised of primarily construction and non residential mortgage loans and business loans 
comprised of primarily one to four family mortgage loans 
loans purchased by the bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the bank originates 
the bank s purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse  with certain exceptions related to the seller s compliance with representations and warranties  and in accordance with the bank s underwriting criteria for originations 
in addition  purchased loans have a variety of terms  including maturities  interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates  that may differ from those offered at the time by the bank in connection with the loans the bank originates 
the bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area  however  the bank will purchase loans secured by property secured outside its market area to meet its financial objectives 
the market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from carver federal s market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in carver federal s market area 
there can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out of state markets will not deteriorate in the future  resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas 
during fiscal  the properties securing purchased loans were concentrated primarily in the tri state new york area 

table of contents in an effort to reduce these risks  the bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the bank s underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the bank 
a review of each purchased loan is conducted  and the bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring  in each buy sell agreement  a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents 
these warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan 
any misrepresentation must be cured within days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy sell agreement 
interest rates and loan fees 
carver federal determines the interest rates that it charges on loans primarily by comparison of competitive loan rates offered in its market area and by examining the minimum yield requirements for loans purchased by secondary market sources 
loan rates reflect factors such as prevailing market interest rate levels  the supply of money available to the banking industry and the demand for such loans 
these factors are in turn affected by general economic conditions  the monetary policies of the federal government  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb  the general supply of money in the economy  tax policies and governmental budget matters 
carver federal charges fees in connection with loan commitments and originations  rate lock ins  loan modifications  late payments  changes of property ownership and for miscellaneous services related to its loans 
loan origination fees are calculated as a percentage of the loan principal 
the bank typically receives fees of between zero and one point one point being equivalent to of the principal amount of the loan in connection with the origination of fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the loan origination fee  net of certain direct loan origination expenses  is deferred and accreted into income over the estimated life of the loan using the interest method 
if a loan is prepaid or sold all remaining deferred fees with respect to such loan are taken into income at such time 
in addition to the foregoing fees  carver federal receives fees for servicing mortgage loans for others  which in turn generally are sub serviced for carver federal by a third party servicer 
servicing activities include the collection and processing of mortgage payments  accounting for loan repayment funds and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related expenses out of escrowed funds 
income from these activities varies from period to period with the volume and type of loans originated  sold and purchased  which in turn is dependent on prevailing market interest rates and their affect on the demand for loans in the bank s market area 
carver federal also receives fees for servicing sba loans 
servicing activities include collection and processing of payments  accounting for loan repayment funds and sba servicing and reporting requirements 
loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth information at march  regarding the amount of loans maturing in carver federal s portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less

scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets 
the average life of long term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give carver federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event  among other things  that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans in thousands 
table of contents due after march  fixed adjustable total gross loans receivable one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer total asset quality general 
one of the bank s key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements  the bank has been proactive in addressing problem and non performing assets which  in turn  has helped to build the strength of the bank s financial condition 
such strategies  as well as the bank s concentration on one to four family  commercial mortgage lending which includes multifamily and non residential real estate loans  construction lending and business loans mostly secured by real estate and the sba  the maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations and a strong real estate market  have resulted in the bank maintaining a low level of non performing assets 
the underlying credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan 
a borrower s ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income  which  in turn  is impacted by general economic conditions  although other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets  may also impact the borrower s ability to pay 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 
non performing assets 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan  immediate steps are taken by carver federal and its sub servicers to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
with respect to mortgage loans  once the payment grace period has expired in most instances days after the due date  a late notice is mailed to the borrower within two business days and a late charge is imposed  if applicable 
if payment is not promptly received  the borrower is contacted by telephone and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency 
additional calls are made by the th and th day of the delinquency 
if a mortgage loan becomes days delinquent  a letter is mailed to the borrower requesting payment by a specified date 
if a mortgage loan becomes days delinquent  carver federal seeks to make personal contact with the borrower and also has the property inspected 
if a mortgage becomes days delinquent  a letter is sent to the borrower demanding payment by a certain date and indicating that a foreclosure suit will be filed if the deadline is not met 
if payment is still not made  the bank may pursue foreclosure or other appropriate action 
in the case of business loans the collection process is similar 
the bank may pursue foreclosure or other appropriate action for business loans secured by real estate 
for business loans not secured by real estate  the bank may seek the sba guarantee or other appropriate action 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a consumer loan  steps are taken by carver federal s loan servicing department to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
a late notice is mailed to the borrower immediately and a late charge is imposed  if applicable  once the payment grace period has expired days after the due date 
if payment is not promptly received  the borrower is contacted by telephone  and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency 
if a consumer loan becomes days delinquent  a letter is mailed to the borrower requesting payment by a specified date 
if the loan becomes days delinquent  the account is given to an independent collection agency to follow up with the collection of the account 
if the loan becomes days delinquent  a final warning letter is sent to the borrower and any co borrower 
if the loan remains delinquent  it is reviewed for charge off 
the bank s collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off  except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive 

table of contents the following table sets forth information with respect to carver federal s non performing assets as of march dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis gross loans receivable one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days total non accrual accruing loans past due days other non performing assets real estate owned total other non performing assets total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non accrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds days past due and in the opinion of management the collection of additional interest is doubtful 
payments received on a non accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan 
other non performing assets generally represent property acquired by the bank in settlement of loans ie  through foreclosure  repossession or as an in substance foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value or the cost to acquire 
total non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due and property acquired in settlement of loans 
at march   total non performing assets decreased by million to million  compared to million at march  at march   other non performing assets consisted of non accrual and accruing loans  past due greater than days  of million and other real estate owned of million 
non accrual loans consist of small business and sba loans  two multi family loans and two one to four family loans 
all are relatively small balance loans and collection efforts are progressing well 
other real estate owned of million reflects four properties in foreclosure 
one property with a loan value of million is currently under contract to be sold and another property with a loan value of million will be repaid by a private mortgage insurer 
asset classification and allowances for losses 
federal regulations and the bank s policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged  if any 
an asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
an asset is classified as loss if it is considered un collectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require a savings institution to establish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss  a savings institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution s classifications 
if a savings institution does not agree with an examiner s classification of an asset  it may appeal this determination to the ots regional director 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
during the third quarter of fiscal  carver changed its loan loss methodology to be consistent with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll the interagency policy statement released by the federal financial regulatory agencies on december  the change had an immaterial affect on the allowance for loan losses at march  management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management s prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
federal examiners may disagree with the savings institution as to the appropriate level of the institution s allowance for loan losses 
while management believes carver federal has established its existing loss allowances in accordance with the alll  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing carver federal s assets  will not require carver federal to increase its loss allowance  thereby negatively affecting carver federal s reported financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding carver federal s alll policy  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents carver federal s methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur 
further  management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans including projected growth and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly 
the internal asset review committee conducts reviews of the bank s loans on at least a quarterly basis and evaluates the need to establish general and specific allowances on the basis of this review 
in addition  management actively monitors carver federal s asset quality and charges off loans and properties acquired in settlement of loans against the allowances for losses on loans and such properties when appropriate and provides specific loss reserves when necessary 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
additionally  the internal asset review committee reviews carver federal s assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether any assets require classification or re classification 
the bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers  each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans 
the board has designated the internal asset review committee to perform quarterly reviews of the bank s asset quality  and their report is submitted to the board for review 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee of the board establishes policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the internal asset review committee in its review of classified assets 
in originating loans  carver federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
it is management s policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  character and size  the bank s and the industry s historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions 
in addition  considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate markets in various states  or of their ultimate impact on carver federal as a result of its purchased loans in such states 
see lending activities loan purchases and originations 
carver federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the bank s income 
general allowances are established by the board on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the bank s loans  taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency trends  current charge off and loss experience  the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
specific allowances are provided for individual loans  or portions of loans  when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan 
at the date of foreclosure or other repossession or at the date the bank determines a property is an impaired property  the bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
carver federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure 
subsequent to acquisition  management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  declines 
if  upon ultimate disposition of the property  net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property  a gain on sale of real estate is recorded  providing the bank did not provide the loan

investment activities general 
the bank utilizes mortgage backed and other investment securities in its asset liability management strategy 
in making investment decisions  the bank considers  among other things  its yield and interest rate objectives  its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank s asset liability management policies  investment quality  loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements  liquidity needs and performance objectives 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that securities be classified into three categories trading  held to maturity  and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at march   the bank had no securities classified as trading 
at march   million  or of the bank s mortgage backed and other investment securities  was classified as available for sale 
the remaining million  or  was classified as held to maturity 

table of contents mortgage backed securities 
the bank has invested in mortgage backed securities in order to achieve its asset liability management goals and collateral needs 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than whole loans  they present substantially lower credit risk  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the bank 
because carver federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage backed securities  these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities  which generally only pay principal at maturity 
mortgage backed securities also help the bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation qualified thrift lender test and federal and state taxation 
at march   mortgage backed securities constituted of total assets  as compared to of total assets at march  carver federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed securities in the form of government national mortgage association gnma pass through certificates  fnma and fhlmc participation certificates 
gnma pass through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the united states government while fnma and fhlmc certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities generally entitle carver federal to receive a pro rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages 
the cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity 
carver federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the small business administration sba 
the bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which at march   constituted million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  however  expose carver federal to certain unique risks 
in a declining rate environment  accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose carver federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds 
in the event the mortgage backed security has been funded with an interest bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage backed security  the bank s interest rate spread could be adversely affected 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages  effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage backed security and exposing the bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest 
for additional information regarding carver federal s mortgage backed securities portfolio and its maturities  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  securities 
other investment securities 
in addition to mortgage backed securities  the bank also invests in high quality assets primarily government and agency obligations with short and intermediate terms typically seven years or less to maturity 
carver federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments  including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments  deposits at the fhlb ny  certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
the bank may also invest  subject to certain limitations  in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency  and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other earning assets 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain an investment in fhlb ny stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities 
for additional information  see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation liquidity 
securities impairment 
the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank periodically reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
however  if such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings 
at march   the bank carried no other than temporarily impaired securities 
deposit activity and other sources of funds general 
deposits are the primary source of carver federal s funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  carver federal derives funds from loan principal repayments  loan and investment interest payments  maturing investments and fee income 
loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits  competition and general economic conditions 
borrowed money may be used to supplement the bank s available funds  and from time to time the bank borrows funds from the fhlb ny and has borrowed funds through repurchase agreements and trust preferred debt securities

borrowed money 
while deposits are the primary source of funds for carver federal s lending  investment and general operating activities 
carver federal is authorized to use advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos from the fhlb ny and approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
the fhlb ny functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb system  carver federal is required to own stock in the fhlb ny and is authorized to apply for advances 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
advances from the fhlb ny are secured by carver federal s stock in the fhlb ny and a pledge of carver federal s mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios 
on september   carver statutory trust i issued  shares  liquidation amount  per share  of floating rate capital securities

table of contents regulation and supervision general the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by its primary regulator  the ots 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif  and it is a member of the fhlb 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the holding company  as a unitary savings and loan holding company  is subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the ots and is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with  the rules and regulations of the ots and of the sec under the federal securities laws 
the ots and the fdic periodically perform safety and soundness examinations of the bank and the holding company and test compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate and control the activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
this structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such laws and regulations whether by the ots  the fdic or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the bank and the holding company and their operations and stockholders 
the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the holding company 
federal banking regulation activity powers 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act hola  as amended  and the regulations of the ots 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
the bank s authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
on december   the ots published guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the ots s existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
the bank has evaluated the cre guidance to determine its compliance and  as necessary  modified its risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
see lending activities and asset quality in item  business for discussions of our loan product offerings and related underwriting standards 
loans to one borrower limitations 
the bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as a national bank 
with specified exceptions  the bank s total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income 
the bank may lend additional amounts up to of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank currently complies with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was million 
qualified thrift lender test 
under hola  the bank must comply with a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under this test  the bank is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association s total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b goodwill and other intangible assets and c the value of property used to conduct the bank s business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities and consumer loans 
if the bank fails the qtl test  it must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert from a thrift charter to a bank charter 
in addition  if the bank does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the test  the institution would be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank and would have to repay any outstanding advances from the fhlb ny as promptly as possible 
at march   the bank maintained approximately of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank had also met the qtl test in each of the prior months and was  therefore  a qualified thrift lender 

table of contents capital requirements 
ots regulations require the bank to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio requirement of of total assets  as adjusted under ots regulations  a leverage ratio requirement of of core capital to such adjusted total assets  and a risk based capital ratio requirement of of core and supplementary capital to total risk weighted assets 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  the bank must compute its risk weighted assets by multiplying its assets and certain off balance sheet items by risk weights  which range from for cash and obligations issued by the us government or its agencies to for consumer and commercial loans  as assigned by the ots capital regulations based on the risks that the ots believes are inherent in the type of asset 
generally  tangible capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings and minority interests in equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank 
core capital is defined similarly to tangible capital  but also includes certain qualifying supervisory goodwill less certain disallowed assets 
supplementary capital includes cumulative and other perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  up to of unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with a readily determinable fair value may be included in supplementary capital 
the allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  and the amount of supplementary capital that may be included as total capital cannot exceed the amount of core capital 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
the bank  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and are consistent with the bank s risk profile 
at march   the bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with a tangible capital ratio of  leverage capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  as amended fdicia  requires that the ots and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account interest rate risk  concentrations of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
the ots adopted regulations  effective january   that set forth the methodology for calculating an interest rate risk component to be incorporated into the ots risk based capital regulations 
on may   the ots adopted an amendment to its capital regulations which eliminated the interest rate risk component of the risk based capital requirement 
pursuant to the amendment  the ots will continue to monitor the interest rate risk of individual institutions through the ots requirements for interest rate risk management  the ability of the ots to impose individual minimum capital requirements on institutions that exhibit a high degree of interest rate risk  and the requirements of thrift bulletin a  which provides guidance on the management of interest rate risk and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
in addition  the ots monitors the interest rate risk of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities and therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution s net worth 
the ots has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  ots bulletin a provides guidance on the management of interest rate risk and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the ots regarding npv analysis 
the ots has not imposed any such requirements on the bank 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is authorized and  in some cases  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s regulatory capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 

table of contents the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
under the ots regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
at march   the bank was considered well capitalized by the ots 
limitation on capital distributions 
the ots imposes various restrictions on the bank s ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital 
a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  must file a notice with the ots at least days before making a capital distribution 
however  the bank must file an application for prior approval if the total amount of its capital distributions including each proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed the bank s net income for that year plus the bank s retained net income for the previous two years 
the bank may not pay dividends to the holding company if  after paying those dividends  the bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the ots notified the bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision 
the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
liquidity 
the bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs 
in the normal course of business  the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating  investing and financing activities 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the bank s most liquid assets 
the bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  federal law permits the bank to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority for the bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the bank s activities 
this authority under federal law and ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the cra  as amended  as implemented by ots regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the bank nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra does  however  require the ots  in connection with its examination of the bank  to assess the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
in particular  the system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its assessment areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of banking services through its branches  atm centers and other offices 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination conducted in regulations require that we publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of cra 
the holding company has no such agreements in place at this time 

table of contents transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates and insiders is limited by ots regulations and by sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the bank as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
additionally  certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank s capital 
collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the bank 
in addition  ots regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank s board 
at march   there were no loans to officers or directors 
the frb has confirmed its previous interpretations of sections a and b of the fra with regulation w 
the ots has also conformed its regulations to agree with regulation w 
regulation w made various changes to existing law regarding sections a and b  including expanding the definition of what constitutes an affiliate subject to sections a and b and exempting certain subsidiaries of state chartered banks from the restrictions of sections a and b 
the ots regulations provide for additional restrictions imposed on savings associations under section of hola  including provisions prohibiting a savings association from making a loan to an affiliate that is engaged in non bank holding company activities and provisions prohibiting a savings association from purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary 
the ots regulations also include certain specific exemptions from these prohibitions 
the frb and the ots expect each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w and the ots regulation 
these regulations have had no material adverse effect on our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
assessment 
the ots charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates 
these assessments are based on three components the size of the association  on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of   or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
effective july   the ots adopted a final rule replacing examination fees for savings and loan holding companies with semi annual assessments 
for fiscal  carver paid million in ots assessments 
enforcement 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
standards for safety and soundness 
the ots has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
in addition  ots regulations authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
insurance of deposit accounts the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the depositors insurance fund dif 
the dif is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic recently amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
risk category i  which contains the least risky depository institutions  is expected to include more than of all institutions 
unlike the other categories  risk category i contains further risk differentiation based on the fdic s analysis of financial ratios  examination component ratings and other information 
assessment rates are determined semi annually by the fdic and currently range from five to seven basis points for the healthiest institutions risk category i to basis points of assessable deposits for the riskiest risk category iv 
the fdic may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no single adjustment can exceed three basis points 

table of contents the reform act also provided for a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  subject to certain limitations with respect to institutions that are exhibiting weaknesses  credits can be used to offset assessments until exhausted 
the reform act also provided for the possibility that the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions once the dif reserve ratio equals or exceeds of estimated insured deposits 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly  and during the calendar year ending december   averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the reform act provided the fdic with authority to adjust the dif ratio to insured deposits within a range of to  in contrast to the prior statutorily fixed ratio of 
the ratio  which is viewed by the fdic as the level that the fund should achieve  was established by the agency at for the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
the bank s total expense in fiscal for fdic assessment for financing corporation fico bonds interest payments was million 
due to the bank s favorable assessment risk classification there was no deposit insurance assessment on our deposits for fiscal federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which is one of the twelve regional banks composing the fhlb system 
each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as a fhlb ny member  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  and ii or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb ny of its outstanding advances from the fhlb ny 
the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the fhlb ny at march  of million 
any advances from the fhlb ny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and all long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
fhlb ny is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the fhlb ny can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the fhlb ny imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb ny advances increased  the bank s net interest income would be adversely affected 
dividends from fhlb ny to the bank amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dividend rate paid on fhlb ny stock at march  was 
under the gramm leach bliley act  as amended glb  which repeals historical restrictions and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings banks such as the bank 
glb also replaces the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that requires each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
two classes of stock are authorized class a redeemable on six months notice and class b redeemable on five years notice 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal housing finance board  as required by glb  the fhlb has adopted a capital plan that will change the foregoing minimum stock ownership requirements for fhlb stock 
under the new capital plan  each member of the fhlb will have to maintain a minimum investment in fhlb capital stock in an amount equal to the sum of the greater of  or of the member s mortgage related assets and of the dollar amount of any outstanding advances under such member s advances  collateral pledge and security agreement with the fhlb ny 

table of contents federal reserve system 
under the frb s regulations  the bank is required to maintain non interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
frb regulations generally require that a reserves of must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the frb  and b a reserve of million and subject to adjustment by the frb between and must be maintained against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with these reserve requirements 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets to the extent that the requirement exceeds vault cash 
privacy protection 
carver federal is subject to ots regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of glb 
these regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
the regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices 
in addition  to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information  subject to certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information 
these regulations implement certain provisions of glb 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  which would include administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines 
holding company regulation 
the holding company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the ots 
as such  the holding company is registered with and is subject to ots examination and supervision  as well as certain reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the holding company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution 
unlike bank holding companies  federal savings and loan holding companies are not subject to any regulatory capital requirements or to supervision by the frb 
glb restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
unitary savings and loan holding companies that are grandfathered  ie  unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the ots on or before may   such as the holding company  retain their authority under the prior law 
all other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for bank holding companies  as defined under glb 
glb also prohibits non financial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies 
restrictions applicable to all savings and loan holding companies 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including the holding company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control as defined under hola of another savings institution or a holding company parent without prior ots approval  through merger  consolidation  or purchase of assets  another savings institution or a holding company thereof  or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution or a holding company  without prior ots approval  or control of any depository institution not insured by the fdic except through a merger with and into the holding company s savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the ots 
a savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located  except in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the fdic  if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association 

table of contents the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary savings association  a non subsidiary holding company  or a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
federal securities laws 
the holding company is subject to the periodic reporting  proxy solicitation  tender offer  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
delaware corporation law 
the holding company is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
thus  it is subject to regulation by the state of delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
new york state banking laws and regulations 
on october   carver federal established a new subsidiary  cmb  as a state chartered limited purpose commercial bank in new york  to accept deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities in the state of new york 
cmb is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the new york state superintendent of banks  as its primary regulator and the fdic  as the deposit insurer 
as of march   carver federal has discontinued the operations of cmb 
cmb is in the process of dissolution 
in addition to being a regulator of cmb  the new york state banking department has adopted section l to the banking law and regulations which impose restrictions and limitations on certain high cost home loans made by any individual or entity  including a federally chartered savings bank  that originates more than one high cost home loan in new york state in a month period 
among other things  the regulations and statute prohibit certain mortgage loan provisions and certain acts and practices by originators and impose certain disclosure and reporting requirements 
it is unclear whether these provisions would be preempted by section a of hola  as implemented by the lending and investment regulations of the ots 
the ots has not yet adopted regulations regarding high cost mortgage loans and is currently considering whether it will do so 
although the bank does not originate loans that meet the definition of high cost mortgage loan under the proposed regulations  in the event the bank determines to originate such loans in the future  the bank may be subject to such regulation  if adopted as proposed 
other federal regulation 
the bank is subject to ots regulations implementing the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including banks  thrifts  brokers  dealers  credit unions  money transfer agents and parties registered under the united states commodity exchange act of  as amended 
title iii of the usa patriot act and the related ots regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions establishment of anti money laundering programs 
establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts  including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time 
establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering 
prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the holding company and the bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns  report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending march st  using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including in particular the bank s tax reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the bank or the holding company 

table of contents bad debt reserves 
prior to fiscal  the bank met the requirement as a small bank one with assets having an adjusted tax basis of million or less and was permitted to maintain a reserve for bad debts  and to make  within specified formula limits  annual additions to the reserve which are deductible for purposes of computing the bank s taxable income 
since fiscal year  the bank has not been considered to be a small bank because its total assets have exceeded million 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the bank s base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of march   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank s taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in the bank s taxable income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
elimination of dividends  dividends received deduction 
the holding company may exclude from its income of dividends received from the bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is generally in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the holding company and the bank will not file a consolidated tax return  except that if the holding company or the bank owns more than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend  then of any dividends received may be deducted 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the bank and the holding company are subject to new york state franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax 
entire net income means federal taxable income with adjustments 
the bank and the holding company file combined returns and are subject to taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including the bank s deductions for additions to its reserve for bad debts 
the new york state franchise tax rate based upon entire net income for fiscal and was and  respectively  including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge of net income 
in general  the holding company is not required to pay new york state tax on dividends and interest received from the bank or on gains realized on the sale of bank stock 
sixty percent of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital are excluded from new york state entire net income 
distributions to carver federal received from cac are eligible for the new york state dividends received deduction 
however  the holding company was subject to a franchise tax rate of including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge for fiscal based upon alternative entire net income 
for this purpose  alternative entire net income is determined by adding back of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital to new york state entire net income 
new york state has enacted legislation that enabled the bank to avoid the recapture of the new york state tax bad debt reserves that otherwise would have occurred as a result of the changes in federal law and to continue to utilize either the federal method or a method based on a percentage of its taxable income for computing additions to its bad debt reserve 
new york city 
the bank and the holding company are also subject to a similarly calculated new york city banking corporation tax of on income allocated to new york city 
in this connection  legislation was enacted regarding the use and treatment of tax bad debt reserves that is substantially similar to the new york state legislation described above 
the bank and the holding company also are subject to new york city banking corporation tax of on alternative entire net income allocated to new york city 
delaware taxation 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware

risk factors 
risk is an inherent part of carver s business and activities 
the following is a summary of risk factors relevant to the company s operations which should be carefully reviewed 
these risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance 
changes in interest rate environment may negatively affect carver s net income  mortgage loan originations and valuation of available for sale securities 
the company s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on interest earning assets  primarily our mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities  and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in market interest rates affect customer demand for products and services 
carver is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related loan refinancing opportunities and competition 
the company s objective is to fund its liquidity needs primarily through lower costing deposit growth 
however  from time to time carver federal borrows from the fhlb ny 
more recently  the cost of deposits and borrowings have become significantly higher with the rising interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted net interest income 
during fiscal  the federal open market committee fomc lowered the federal funds rate six times a total of basis points 
us treasury yields on five and ten year maturities continued to decline during fiscal from fiscal  thirteen week maturities have also declined in fiscal from fiscal this has resulted in a change in the us treasury yield curve from a flat and at times inverted yield curve back to its typical upward slope 
the bank s short term borrowings  as well as its deposits  are generally priced relative to short term us treasury yields  whereas its mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are generally priced relative to medium term two to five years us treasury or fhlb yields 
a flat or inverted yield curve could cause the company s net interest income and net interest margin to contract  which could have a material adverse effect on its net income and cash flows  and the value of its assets 
interest rates are expected to continue to fluctuate and the company cannot predict future federal reserve bank actions or other factors that will cause rates to change 
the estimated fair value of the company s available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on changes in interest rates 
carver federal s securities portfolio is comprised primarily of adjustable rate securities 
there has been an improvement in valuation of the bank s available for sale securities because interest rates have declined in fiscal carver s results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area 
at march   a majority of the bank s lending portfolio was concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of this geographic concentration  carver s results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area 
decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to its borrowers 
adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
consequently  deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank s loan portfolio  which could result in increased delinquencies  decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses 
such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services  and  accordingly  further negatively affect results of operations 
during fiscal  the national real estate market in general has been in a decline compared to fiscal the slowdown in the general housing market is evidenced by reports of reduced levels of new and existing home sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  stagnant to declining property values and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
however  carver federal s direct local real estate markets have been stable  which appears to be due in part to the limited availability of affordable housing alternatives in the markets in which carver federal operates 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income or an adverse impact on our loan losses 
strong competition within the bank s market areas could hurt expected profits and slow growth 
the new york metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  a number of which are significantly larger than carver federal and with greater financial resources 
additionally  various large out of state financial institutions may continue to enter the new york metropolitan area market 
all are considered competitors to varying degrees 
carver federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
competition for loans  both locally and in the aggregate  comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
market area competition is a factor in pricing the bank s loans and deposits  which could reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas 

table of contents the bank s increased emphasis on non residential  construction real estate lending and small business lending may create increased exposure to lending risks 
at march   million  or  of our total loans receivable portfolio consisted of non residential and construction real estate loans compared to million  or  at march  non residential and construction real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying properties and the businesses which operate from within them  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   million  or  of our total loans receivable consisted of business loans as compared to million  or  at march  the bank increased its business loan portfolio during fiscal with the acquisition of ccb 
business loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying business  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse economic conditions  increased competition or changes in government regulation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank operates in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of our business activities 
carver federal is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots  the fdic  and  to a lesser extent  by the new york state banking department 
as a result  we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and our depositors  and not to benefit our stockholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  we must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risk  or the guidance 
in general  the guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
from time to time  we may originate interest only and interest only reduced documentation residential loans 
we originate such loans for sale to investors  such as the federal national mortgage association  known as fannie mae 
we do not originate negative amortization or payment option loans 
reduced documentation loans include stated income  full asset  or sifa loans  stated income  stated asset  or sisa loans  and super streamline loans 
sifa and sisa loans require a prospective borrower to complete a standard mortgage loan application while the super streamline product requires the completion of an abbreviated application and is in effect considered a no documentation loan 
each of these products requires the receipt of an appraisal of the real estate used as collateral for the mortgage loan and a credit report on the prospective borrower 
the loans are priced according to our internal risk assessment of the loan giving consideration to the loan to value ratio  the potential borrower s credit scores and various other credit criteria 
sifa loans require the verification of a potential borrower s asset information on the loan application  but not the income information provided 
the bank has evaluated the guidance for our compliance  risk management practices and underwriting guidelines as they relate to originations and purchases of the subject loans  or practices relating to communications with consumers 
the guidance has no impact on the company s loan origination and purchase volumes or the company s underwriting procedures currently or in future periods 
efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act involve significant expenditures  and non compliance with the sarbanes oxley act may adversely affect us 
the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec increase the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practice 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  greater compliance costs  including design  testing and audit costs related to internal controls  as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
for example  under section of sarbanes oxley  beginning with this annual report on form k  the company s management is required to issue a report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
beginning with carver s fiscal  carver s management will also be required to file an auditors attestation report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
the company expects the implementation of these new rules and regulations to continue to increase its accounting  legal  and other costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
in the event that the company is unable to maintain or achieve compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and related rules  carver s profitability and the market price of carver s stock may be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition  the rules adopted as a result of the sarbanes oxley act could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the company s control 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  including with respect to federal and state taxation  may cause results of operations to differ materially 
in addition  cost of compliance could adversely affect carver s ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for carver federal  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on carver federal  and therefore on the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay our wholesale borrowings  and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers 
our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities  cash flows from the sale of loans and securities  typically in connection with the post merger repositioning of our balance sheet  the deposits we acquire in connection with our acquisitions and those we gather organically through our branch network  and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlb ny 
in addition  and depending on current market conditions  we have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings  and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates  whether actual or perceived  local and national economic conditions  and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve 
furthermore  changes to the fhlb ny s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict our ability to borrow  and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 
a decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans  invest in securities  and meet our expenses  or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands 
the bank s ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the company is subject to regulatory limitations which may prevent the company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation 
carver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the ots and almost all of its operating assets are owned by carver federal 
carver relies primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders  to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by the bank to the company  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  carver federal must file a notice or an application depending on the proposed dividend amount with the ots prior to each capital distribution 
the ots will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the ots minimum capital requirements 
based on carver federal s current financial condition  it is not expected that this provision will have any impact on the company s receipt of dividends from the bank 
payment of dividends by carver federal also may be restricted at any time  at the discretion of the ots  if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
carver s income tax benefits risk 
the company s receipt of the remaining new markets tax credits income tax benefits over approximately the next six years depends on its ability to meet the nmtc compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax credits from the nmtc investment 
for additional information regarding carver s nmtc  refer to item  new market tax credit award 
carver faces system failure risks and security risks 
the computer systems and network infrastructure the company and its third party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
fire  power loss or other failures may effect carver s computer equipment and other technology  or that of the company s third party service providers 
also  the company s computer systems and network infrastructure could be damaged by hacking and identity theft which could adversely affect the results of carver s operations  or that of the company s third party service providers 
we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  if impairment of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined we may be required to record a charge to earnings in the period of such determination 
our business could suffer if we fail to retain skilled people 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges 
competition for the best people is intense  and the company s size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees which could adversely affect the results of our operations 

table of contents a natural disaster could harm carver s business 
natural disasters could harm the company s operations directly through interference with communications  as well as through the destruction of facilities and financial information systems 
such disasters may also have an impact on collateral underlying the bank s loans 
the company may face higher insurance costs in the event of such disasters

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
executive summary carver bancorp  inc is a savings and loan holding company organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
carver is committed to providing superior customer service while offering a range of banking products and financial services to our retail and commercial customers 
the holding company s primary subsidiary is carver federal savings bank  which operates from ten branches in the new york city boroughs of manhattan  brooklyn and queens 
fiscal fiscal was a particularly challenging year for carver  driven in part by the yield curve and disruptions in credit markets  followed by the threat of recession 
nevertheless  carver s business held up well  as the impact of national events has not been as apparent in our core markets 
carver was spared the brunt of the turbulent credit environment  given our limited exposure to loan and investment products of concern to the financial markets 
although the company s local markets have not experienced in any material respect the fallout impacting other regions across the nation  management is intensely focused on any signs of weakening conditions 
the company believes its small business and real estate lending teams are well positioned to source attractive opportunities  and carver remains committed to solid asset quality and accretive asset growth as top priorities 
reported earnings increased from fiscal  but were flat when removing the impact of fiscal s acquisition and balance sheet restructuring 
the company s net interest income grew to a record level of over million  following an increase in our net interest margin of basis points to 
this margin expansion resulted from a increase in loans and deposit growth of  although consistent with peers  core deposits are migrating to higher priced cds 
additionally  credit quality remained strong with non performing loans at of total assets 
securities and borrowings portfolios decreased during fiscal  which is consistent with the company s strategy to reduce lower yielding securities and invest in higher yielding mortgages and loans 
carver s fiscal performance was driven by three primary factors first  carver s lending business continued to excel  and credit quality remained stable  second  carver leveraged its new markets tax credit award to bolster bottom line performance  and third  carver s asset liability management eased margin pressure 
the bank s non interest income benefited from a significant new markets tax credit transaction generating a million payment during the year  along with increased lending and retail fee generation 
with this transaction  the bank s million award received in june has been fully invested 
carver s nmtc award continues to provide a federal income tax benefit to the company s bottom line 
the company expects to receive additional nmtc tax benefits of approximately million from its million investment over approximately the next six years 
asset quality remained solid in fiscal notwithstanding the bank s loan portfolio growth and diversification into small business lending 
the company believes that the bank s loan loss provision recorded in fiscal and the bank s allowance for loan losses are adequate 
expenses grew year over year  largely based on substantial expansion of non interest expense of million 
the increase in expense falls into three categories regulatory requirements preparation for compliance with sarbanes oxley act section and recent inter agency guidance on allowances for loan losses  strengthening the bank s back office  including the accounting  lending and retail operations departments  by adding new staff and providing temporary expertise  and engaging consultants to assist the management team to analyze significant opportunities to improve financial results 
for example  the bank engaged consultants to conduct a rigorous business optimization review to help management identify further improvements in our operations  in part through greater systems integration 
while these investments impact near term results  they are fundamental to building the scale and infrastructure necessary for the company to grow profitably 
during fiscal  management expects to outline specific steps to improve efficiency and return on equity 
the first step should occur in the second quarter of fiscal when the bank expects to complete outsourcing of its residential lending department 
management expects that this arrangement will expand the bank s product base and improve customer service  while reducing costs to the company 

table of contents fiscal the industry economic environment in fiscal is expected to be characterized by continued constraint in credit markets combined with the threat of stagflation 
the credit issues relate to weaknesses in residential and commercial real estate due to subprime issues and general economic conditions 
interest rates are expected to remain low in the near term as the federal reserve lowered the fed funds rate in efforts to stimulate growth 
however  inflation fears may constrain the federal reserve s ability to lower rates from current levels  and inflation concerns may have the impact of steepening the yield curve and encouraging the federal reserve to consider raising the fed funds rate later this year 
thrifts  many of which have business models primarily dependent on spread income from real estate loans  have been especially hard hit in this environment 
the thrift industry posted a record billion loss in the december quarter 
in calendar year carver s fiscal  industry analysts expect earnings shrinkage for the sector  and expect smaller banks to suffer more than larger banks 
carver federal s credit quality has been stable because its neighborhood markets have not been as severely impacted by the credit issues impacting the nation 
the outlook for fiscal reflects many of the economic and competitive factors that the bank and the banking industry faced in fiscal as a result  the bank expects the operating environment to remain challenging 
in this challenging climate  the bank will continue to focus on growth in its traditional businesses  namely the expansion of real estate loans and core deposits 
the bank expects its new business and marketing efforts to core customer groups including small business owners  landlords  and churches and other non profits  to drive the bank s deposit gathering strategy 
carver expects its business performance in fiscal and thereafter will be propelled by several factors 
first  the small business and non residential markets offer the opportunity for higher yielding loans and lower costing deposits 
management believes serving these market niches is critical to carver s growth and future profitability 
second  carver s focus on improving its back office operations should pay dividends in the form of efficiencies 
third  carver enjoys a venerable reputation in the world of community development financial institutions  and management believes that carver may leverage that reputation to its business advantage by broadening its new business efforts to target a broader institutional audience 
finally  management believes that growth and profitability may be accelerated by a prudent merger and acquisition strategy 
the importance of a strong and efficient operating platform has been amplified in the current regulatory environment and carver s competitive marketplace 
acquisition of community capital bank on september   the bank completed its acquisition of community capital bank  a brooklyn based new york state chartered commercial bank  with approximately million in assets and two branches  in a cash transaction totaling approximately million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  ccb s shareholders were paid per outstanding share including options which immediately vested with the consummation of the merger and the bank incurred an additional million in transaction related costs 
the combined entities operate under carver federal s thrift charter and carver federal continues to be supervised by the office of thrift supervision 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase accounting method  included the recognition of approximately million of core deposit intangibles and million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets goodwill 
at march   goodwill relating to the transaction and subsequent additional purchase accounting adjustments  primarily income taxes  sales tax assessment and professional fees  totaled approximately million 
new markets tax credit award in june  carver federal was selected by the us department of treasury to receive an award of million in new markets tax credits 
the nmtc award is used to stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating the revitalization of the community  pursuant to the goals of the nmtc program 
the nmtc award provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
the credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment 
recognition of the bank s nmtc award began in december when the bank invested million  one half of its million award 
in december  the bank invested an additional million and transferred rights to million to an investor in a nmtc project 
the bank s nmtc allocation was fully invested as of december  during the seven year period  assuming the bank meets compliance requirements  the bank will receive of the million invested award amount in tax benefits over each of the first three years  and over each of the next four years 
the company expects to receive the remaining nmtc tax benefits of approximately million from its million investment over the next six years 

table of contents critical accounting policies various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
carver s policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is the most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of carver s financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our summary of significant accounting policies  including those related to allowance for loan losses  and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
securities impairment the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in the portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank periodically reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
however  if such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings 
at march   the bank carried no other than temporarily impaired securities 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio as of march  during the third quarter of fiscal  carver changed its loan loss methodology to be consistent with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses released by the federal financial regulatory agencies on december  the change had an immaterial affect on the allowance for loan losses at march  management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management s prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
carver federal maintains a loan review system  which includes periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
loan loss allowances are established for problem loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of the underlying collateral 
on the remainder of its loan portfolio  loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
although management believes that adequate loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of the loan loss allowance may be necessary in the future 
the methodology employed for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of the following criteria establishment of loan loss allowance amounts for all specifically identified criticized and classified loans that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review process  bank regulatory examinations or carver federal s external auditors 
an average loss factor  giving effect to historical loss experience over several years and other qualitative factors  is applied to all loans not subject to specific review 
evaluation of any changes in risk profile brought about by business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
an important consideration in performing this evaluation is the concentration of real estate related loans located in the new york city metropolitan area 
all new loan originations are assigned a credit risk grade which commences with loan officers and underwriters grading the quality of their loans one to five under a nine category risk classification scale  the first five categories of which represent performing loans 
reserves are held based on actual loss factors based on several years of loss experience and other qualitative factors applied to the outstanding balances in each loan category 
all loans are subject to continuous review and monitoring for changes in their credit grading 
grading that falls into criticized or classified categories credit grading six through nine are further evaluated and reserved amounts are established for each loan based on each loan s potential for loss and include consideration of the sufficiency of collateral 
any adverse trend in real estate markets could seriously affect underlying values available to protect against loss 

table of contents other evidence used to support the amount of the allowance and its components includes amount and trend of criticized loans  actual losses  peer comparisons with other financial institutions  and economic data associated with the real estate market in the company s lending market areas 
a loan is considered to be impaired  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  when it is probable that carver federal will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
carver federal tests loans covered under sfas for impairment if they are on non accrual status or have been restructured 
consumer credit non accrual loans are not tested for impairment because they are included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that  by definition  are excluded from the scope of sfas impaired loans are required to be measured based upon i the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s initial effective interest rate  ii the loan s market price  or iii fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan  an allowance must be established for the difference 
the allowance is established by either an allocation of the existing allowance for loan losses or by a provision for loan losses  depending on various circumstances 
allowances are not needed when credit losses have been recorded so that the recorded investment in an impaired loan is less than the loan valuation 
asset liability management the company s primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between the rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and the credit quality of earning assets 
management s asset liability objectives are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the economic environment is uncertain regarding future interest rate trends 
management monitors the company s cumulative gap position  which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk  such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates 
stock repurchase program refer to item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis as a financial institution  the bank s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which are short term in maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are held by the bank  most of the company s interest rate risk exposure is retained by the bank 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank 
based upon the bank s nature of operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank does not own any trading assets 
carver federal seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities 
to a lesser extent  carver federal also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios 
as discussed more fully below  there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income 
as illustrated below  carver federal had a negative one year gap equal to of total rate sensitive assets at march  as a result  carver federal s net interest income could be negatively affected by rising interest rates and positively affected by falling interest rates 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities  prepayments and repricing of the major rate sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march  maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment 
the information presented in the following table is derived in part from data incorporated in schedule cmr consolidated maturity and rate  which is part of the bank s quarterly reports filed with the ots 
the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank s actual results

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate 
virtually all of the adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate 
net portfolio value npv analysis 
as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates  management also uses the npv methodology 
npv is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off balance sheet contracts 
under this methodology  interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined rate scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 

table of contents presented below  as of march   is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points and basis points plus or minus changes in market interest rates 
such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank s current capital position 
the bank considers its level of interest rate risk for fiscal  as measured by changes in npv  to be minimal 
the information set forth below relates solely to the bank  however  because virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level  management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company s interest rate risk dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rate amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp bp   bp bp   bp march  risk measures bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of carver federal s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of carver federal s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal s net interest income and may differ from actual results 

table of contents average balance  interest and average yields and rates the following table sets forth certain information relating to carver federal s average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and related yields for the years ended march the table also presents information for the fiscal years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of an institution s profitability is its net interest margin  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

comparison of financial condition at march  and assets at march   total assets increased million  or  to million compared to million at march   primarily the result of increases in loans receivable and loans held for sale of million  other assets of million and cash and cash equivalents of million  partially offset by decreases in investment securities of million and fhlb ny stock of million 
total loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in commercial real estate loans of million and an increase in construction loans of million  offset by a decrease of multi family loans of million 
the bank continues to grow its loan portfolio through focusing on the origination of loans in the markets it serves and will continue to augment these originations with loan purchases 
at march   construction loans represented of the loan portfolio 
approximately of the bank s construction loans are participations in loans originated by community preservation corporation 
cpc is a non profit mortgage lender whose mission is to enhance the quality and quantity of affordable housing in the new york  new jersey  and connecticut tri state area 
the bank s construction lending activity is concentrated in the new york city market 
at this time  the new york city real estate market has been resilient relative to the real estate downturn impacting other parts of the us the economic environment is expected to be characterized by continued constraint in credit markets for affordable housing 
the credit issues relate to weaknesses in residential and commercial real estate due to subprime issues and general economic conditions 
based on recent reports  various factors including continuing demand  relatively low proportion of subprime loans  interest from international buyers  and a lack of affordable housing supply contribute to new york city real estate s continuing strength 
despite those favorable factors  the bank will continue to closely monitor trends 

table of contents other assets increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to a million nmtc transaction on december   which increased both other assets and minority interest 
additionally  other assets consisted of a settlement receivable of million from the sale of certain investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to a million increase in federal funds sold and a million increase in cash and due from banks 
office properties and equipment on a net basis increased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily the result of leasing new office space to consolidate back office operations and the opening of a new atm center 
total securities decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   reflecting a decline of million in available for sale securities and a million decrease in held to maturity securities 
the decrease in total securities is primarily due to collection of normal principal repayments  maturities of securities and the bank s strategy of reducing lower yielding securities and replacing them with higher yielding loans 
however  the bank may invest in securities from time to time to help diversify its asset portfolio  manage liquidity and satisfy collateral requirements for certain deposits 
there were million purchases of securities during the fiscal total securities also declined due to an increase in the net unrealized loss on securities of million resulting from the mark to market of the available for sale securities portfolio 
the bank s investment in fhlb ny stock decreased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the fhlb ny requires banks to own membership stock as well as borrowing activity based stock 
the decrease in investment in fhlb ny stock was the result of the repayment of fhlb ny borrowings  resulting in the net redemption of stock during the period 
liabilities and stockholders equity liabilities at march   total liabilities increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in total liabilities was primarily the result of million of additional customer deposits  offset by decreases of million in advances and borrowed money and million of other liabilities 
deposits increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in deposit balances was primarily the result of an increase in certificates of deposit of million  which were offset by decreases of million in savings and million in money market accounts 
at march   the bank had million in brokered deposits 
advances from the fhlb ny and other borrowed money decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the decrease in advances and borrowed money was primarily the result of a reduction of million in fhlb advances  offset by an increase in repurchase obligations of million at march  compared to no repurchase obligations at march  other liabilities decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to a decrease of million in retail liabilities 
on december   ccdc received an equity investment of million related to a new markets tax credit transaction 
on consolidation  this transaction is reflected as a million increase in other assets and minority interest 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in total stockholders equity was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal totaling million  partially offset by dividends paid of million  the repurchase of common stock totaling million in accordance with the company s stock repurchase program and a favorable pension valuation adjustment of million 
the bank s capital levels meet regulatory requirements of a well capitalized financial institution 

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income the company reported net income of million and diluted earnings per share of for fiscal compared to net income of million and diluted earnings per share of for fiscal net income rose million  or  to million  primarily reflecting increases in net interest income of million and non interest income of million  offset by an increase in non interest expense of million 
the prior year period included special pre tax charges of million related to ccb acquisition costs and million related to the balance sheet repositioning 
interest income interest income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest income increased as a result of an increase in total average balances of interest earning assets of million  which includes an increase in average loan balances of million offset by decreases in average balances of mortgage backed securities of million  investment securities of million and federal funds sold of million 
interest income increased as a result of an increase in average loan balances  acquisition of ccb s higher yielding portfolio and origination of higher yielding loans 
additionally  these results were pursuant to the bank s asset liability strategy of increasing the average loan balances and its higher yields offset by a decline in average balances of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
yields on interest earning assets increased basis points to for fiscal compared to for the prior year period  reflecting increases in yields on loans of basis points  mortgage backed securities of basis points and investment securities of basis points  offset by a decrease in yields on federal funds sold of basis points 
interest income on loans increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal these results were primarily driven by an increase in average loan balances of million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  partly a reflection of the full year impact of the ccb acquisition 
in addition  yield increased basis points to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to growth in higher yielding construction and small business loans 
interest income on securities decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities for fiscal was primarily the result of a million  or  reduction in the average balances of mortgage backed securities to million  compared to million for fiscal the net decrease in the average balance of such securities demonstrates management s commitment to invest proceeds received from the cash flows from the repayment of securities into higher yielding assets and the sale of lower yielding securities to reposition the balance sheet 
the mortgage backed securities yield increased by basis points to  compared to in fiscal additionally  the decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities was partially offset by an increase in investment securities interest of million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the yield on investment securities by basis points to compared to in fiscal  as adjustable rate securities in the portfolio repriced to higher coupon rates 
the increase in interest income on investment securities was offset by a reduction of million  or  in the average balances of investment securities to million compared to million for fiscal interest income on federal funds decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of million decrease in the average balance of federal funds year over year and an basis point decrease in the average rate earned on federal funds 
this decrease in the average rate earned on federal funds was realized as the frb lowered the federal funds rate 
interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of growth in the average balance of certificates of deposit of million over fiscal to million 
interest expense on deposits increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of growth in the average balance of certificates of deposit of million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest paid on certificates of deposit increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal additionally  a basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits to in fiscal compared to in fiscal contributed to the increase 
historically  the bank s customer deposits have provided a relatively low cost funding source from which its net interest income and net interest margin have benefited 
in addition  the bank s relationship with various government entities has been a source of relatively stable and low cost funding 

table of contents interest expense on advances and other borrowed money decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the average balance of total borrowed money outstanding declined  primarily as a result of a million decrease in the average balance of outstanding borrowings to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in interest expense was a basis point increase in the cost of borrowed money to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this was partially offset by an increased cost of debt service on the million in floating rate junior subordinated notes issued by the company in connection with issuance of trust preferred securities by carver statutory trust i in september cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum reset quarterly equal to over the month libor  with a rate at march  of net interest income before provision for loan losses net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid 
our net interest income is significantly impacted by changes in interest rate and market yield curves 
see discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis for further discussion on the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our results of operations 
net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was achieved as a result of an increase in both the average balance and the yield on average interest earning assets of million and basis points  respectively 
offsetting the increase in net interest income was an increase in the average balance and cost of interest bearing liabilities of million and basis points  respectively 
the result was a basis point increase in the interest rate spread to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the net interest margin also increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal provision for loan losses and asset quality the bank provided million in provision for loan losses for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the bank records provisions for loan losses  which are charged to earnings  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
factors considered when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the volume and type of lending conducted  the bank s previous loan loss experience  the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  trends in the local and national economy and trends in the real estate market 
the bank had net charge offs of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal at march  and  the bank s allowance for loan losses was million and million  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at march  compared to at march  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at march  compared to at march  additionally  at a ratio  the level of non performing loans to total loans receivable remains within the range the bank has experienced over the trailing twelve quarters 
the bank s future levels of non performing loans will be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on the bank s customers  interest rates and other internal and external factors existing at the time 
the bank believes its reported allowance for loan losses at march  is adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio 
for further discussion of non performing loans and allowance for loan losses  see item business general description of business asset quality and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
subprime loans on july   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities the agencies published the final interagency statement on subprime lending the statement to address emerging issues and questions relating to certain subprime mortgage lending practices 
although the agencies did not provide a specific definition of a subprime loan in the statement  the statement did highlight the agencies concerns with certain adjustable rate mortgage products offered to subprime borrowers that have one or more of the following characteristics low initial payments based on a fixed introductory rate that expires after a short period and then adjusts to a variable index rate plus a margin for the remaining term of the loan  very high or no limits on how much the payment amount or the interest rate may increase payment or rate caps on reset dates  
table of contents limited or no documentation of borrowers income  product features likely to result in frequent refinancing to maintain an affordable monthly payment  and or substantial prepayment penalties and or prepayment penalties that extend beyond the initial fixed interest rate period 
in the expanded guidance for subprime lending programs  the agencies determined that  generally  subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following two or more day delinquencies in the last months  or one or more day delinquencies in the last months  judgment  foreclosure  repossession  or charge off in the prior months  bankruptcy in the last years  relatively high default probability as evidenced by  for example  a credit bureau risk score fico of or below depending on the product collateral  or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default probability likelihood  and or debt service to income ratio of or greater  or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly debt service requirements from monthly income 
the bank has minimal exposure to the subprime loan market and  therefore  we do not expect the statement to have a material impact on the company 
at march   the bank s loan portfolio contained million in subprime loans  all of which were performing loans 
non interest income non interest income is comprised of depository fees and charges  loan fees and service charges  fee income from banking services and charges  gains or losses from the sale of securities  loans and other assets and other non interest income 
non interest income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a nmtc transfer fee of million  gain on sale of securities of million  write down for the prior year period of loans held for sale of million  other income of million and an increase in loan fees and service charges of million 
the bank will receive additional non interest income over approximately the next eight years from this transaction 
further  as a result of the nmtc transaction  other income increased by million reflecting consolidation of income from minority interest 
in addition  the prior year period included a million charge associated with a balance sheet restructuring implemented to improve margins 
non interest expense non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits of million  consulting expense of million  other expenses of million and net occupancy expense of million 
the increase in employee compensation and benefits is primarily due to the community capital bank acquisition and investments in new talent in the retail  lending and accounting units 
the million increase in consulting expense falls into three categories regulatory requirements preparation for compliance with sarbanes oxley act section and recent inter agency guidance on allowances for loan losses  strengthening our back office  including the accounting  lending and retail operations departments  by adding new staff and providing temporary expertise  and engaging consultants to assist the management team to analyze significant opportunities to improve financial results 
for example  the bank engaged consultants to conduct a rigorous business optimization review to help management identify further potential improvements in the bank s operations  in part through greater systems integration 
the million increase in other expense primarily consists of the cost of sub servicing of loans  atm expenses  charge offs and regulatory reporting costs 
the fiscal expense included million in merger related expenses 
income tax expense income tax benefit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  resulting in a net tax benefit of million  which includes a minority interest tax expense of million 
the increase in tax benefit reflects income before income taxes of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the income tax expense of million for fiscal was offset by the tax benefit generated by the nmtc investment totaling million 
the bank s nmtc award received in june has been fully invested 
the company expects to receive additional nmtc tax benefits of approximately million from its million investment over approximately the next six years

the increase in the average rate earned on loans was principally due to the acquisition of the higher yielding ccb business loan portfolio and an increase in the average rate on mortgage loans 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  reflecting a decrease of million in the average balance of mortgage backed securities to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in the average balance was partially offset by the ccb acquisition 
partially offsetting the decline in income was a basis point increase in the average rate earned on mortgage backed securities to for fiscal from for fiscal the net decrease in the average balance of such securities demonstrates management s commitment to invest proceeds received from the cash flows from the repayment of securities into higher yielding assets and the sale of lower yielding securities to reposition the balance sheet

table of contents income tax expense income tax benefit was million for fiscal  as compared to an income tax expense of million for fiscal the bank recognized a million benefit in fiscal from the nmtc program and pre tax income was million less in fiscal compared to fiscal the two items account for the million change in taxes from fiscal to fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the bank s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows  fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and ongoing operating expenses 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
carver federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed by its management and approved by its board of directors 
carver federal s several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the bank was in compliance with this policy as of march  management believes carver federal s short term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand  potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements 
additionally  carver federal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny utilizing unpledged mortgage backed securities and certain mortgage loans  the sale of available for sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans 
at march   based on available collateral held at the fhlb ny  carver federal had the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny an additional million on a secured basis  utilizing mortgage related loans and securities as collateral 
congress eliminated the statutory liquidity requirement that required federal savings banks to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets of between and  as determined by the director of the ots  the bank s primary federal regulator 
the bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation 
as a result of the elimination of the liquidity requirement  the bank manages its liquidity through a board approved liquidity policy 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the level of these assets is dependent on the bank s operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
at march  and  assets qualifying for short term liquidity  including cash and short term investments  totaled million and million  respectively 
the levels of carver federal s short term liquid assets are dependent on carver federal s operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
the most significant liquidity challenge the bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity 
when mortgage interest rates decline  customers refinance activities tend to accelerate  causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage backed securities portfolio to accelerate 
in contrast  when mortgage interest rates increase  refinance activities tend to slow  causing a reduction of liquidity 
however  in a rising rate environment  customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products over variable rate products 
because carver federal generally sells its one to four family year and year fixed rate loan production into the secondary mortgage market  the origination of such products for sale does not significantly reduce carver federal s liquidity 
the ots requires that the bank meet minimum capital requirements 
capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
at march   the bank exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements and qualified  under ots regulations  as a well capitalized institution 
see regulatory capital position below for certain information relating to the bank s regulatory capital compliance at march  the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during fiscal  total cash and cash equivalents increased by million reflecting cash provided by financing activities of million  offset by cash used in operating of million and investing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily resulting from increased deposits of million and consolidation of minority interest in a nmtc transaction of million  offset partially by reductions in borrowings of million and the payment of common dividends of million 
net cash used in operating activities during this period was million  primarily representing funds used in originations of loans held for sale of million  an increase in other assets of million primarily resulting from a nmtc transaction  offset partially by proceeds from sales of loans held for sale million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily representing cash disbursed to fund mortgage loan originations of million  loans purchased from third parties of million and purchases of available for sale securities of million  offset partially by principal collections on loans of million  proceeds from sale of available for sale securities of million and proceeds from principal payments maturities calls of securities of million 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
such instruments primarily include lending commitments 

table of contents lending commitments include commitments to originate mortgage and consumer loans and commitments to fund unused lines of credit 
the bank also has contractual obligations related to operating leases 
additionally  the bank has a contingent liability related to a standby letter of credit

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of carver federal s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on carver federal s performance than do the effects of the general level of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
