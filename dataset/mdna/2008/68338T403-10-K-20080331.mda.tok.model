onvia s proprietary database  onvia dominion  has been compiled over the last ten years  and includes comprehensive  historical and real time information on public and private infrastructure activities unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace 
public sector information within the onvia dominion database is classified and linked within four key hubs of data project history  agency research  buyer research and competitive intelligence 
our database provides information on approximately million procurement related records connected to over  companies from across approximately  government agencies and purchasing offices nationwide 
thousands of records are added to our database each day

our revenues are currently generated from two main business channels client subscriptions and content licenses 
contracts for our subscription based services are typically prepaid  have a minimum term of one year and revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
subscriptions are priced based upon the geographic range  nature of content purchased and  with respect to certain products  the number of users or number of records purchased 
revenue from content licenses is generated from clients who resell onvia s business intelligence data to their customers 
content license contracts are generally multi year arrangements that are invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis  and these agreements generally have a higher annual contract value than our subscription based services 
revenue from content license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for document download services  list rental services  and other market intelligence reports  and these fees are recognized upon delivery 
management overview onvia s financial objectives during included accelerating revenue growth and generating positive operating cash flow for the year  and we achieved both of these goals during year over year revenue growth from to was and we improved this growth rate to in compared to revenue was million in compared to million in we also generated million in cash flow from operations  compared to million and million used in operations during and  respectively 
revenue growth in the second half of slowed modestly for the first time since the launch of our last major product  onvia business builder 
we believe this is primarily due to a slowdown in client upgrade rates as an increasing number of our clients now subscribe to onvia business builder  and a decrease in the size of our acquisition sales force 
to maximize future revenue growth rates we plan to increase the size of our acquisition sales force in  and in february we launched a major new product  onvia planning and construction 
we are traditionally known for our expertise in the public sector  but this new product expands our solutions to include information about the commercial and residential development market and fills an information gap in the marketplace by providing early stage project information 
in july  we terminated the lease on our former corporate headquarters and signed a new lease for a new corporate headquarters with approximately  square feet of rentable office space 
the termination of our former office lease resulted in the reversal of our million idle lease accrual during and acceleration of depreciation on existing leasehold improvements to coincide with the revised lease termination date 
acceleration of depreciation on these leasehold improvements increased our operating expenses by  we also incurred additional operating expenses related to rent on our new corporate headquarters building and office relocation expenses amounting to  during the net impact of these lease transactions during was a reduction of million in operating expenses for the year 
management evaluates four key operating metrics  among others  to assist in the evaluation of our operating performance  and believes these metrics provide a means to compare our business with other businesses in the information industry 
the operating metrics used to measure our two business channels are as follows number of clients  annual contract value  annual contract value per client  and quarterly contract value per client 
number of clients number of clients represents the number of individual businesses subscribing to our products 
at december  we had approximately  clients  down from approximately  at december  the decrease in clients was expected and is primarily the result of the company s decision to focus it sales and marketing efforts toward retention of high value clients and migration of entry level clients into our database products 
client subscribing to our database products have greater lifetime value to the company than do clients subscribing to our entry level products 
in addition  we experienced a decline in new client acquisitions in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of we employed eight more acquisition sales people than in the fourth quarter of this sales force reduction was planned to improve distribution and conversion of our internally generated sales leads 
our sales force was more productive on a per sales person basis  however  the improved productivity did not offset the transaction volume lost due to the smaller sales force 
annual contract value  or acv annual contract value is the aggregate annual revenue value of our subscription client base 
growth in annual contract value demonstrates our success in increasing the number of high value clients and upgrading existing clients into new and higher valued products 
at december   annual contract value was million  up compared to million at december  annual contract value per client  or acvc annual contract value per client is the annual contract value divided by the number of clients and indicates the average value of each of our subscriptions 
at december   acvc was  compared to  at december   an increase of 
these increases were driven by increased adoption of onvia business builder and onvia navigator and scheduled price increases 
quarterly contract value per client  or qcvc quarterly contract value per client represents the average annual contract value of all new and renewing clients transacting during the quarter and is a leading indicator of future annual contract value per client 
qcvc increased to  in the fourth quarter of compared to  in the fourth quarter of and  in the third quarter of in  we increased revenue to million  compared to million in  as a result of increases in acvc and sales of management reports 
gross margin improved to in  compared to in  as a result of efficiencies in our research group 
operating expenses decreased to million  compared to million in  primarily as a result of the reversal of our idle lease accrual as discussed in more detail below 
we generated net income of  in  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in net income in includes a net million decrease to operating expenses related to a series of lease transactions as discussed below 
operating cash flow improved to a positive million in the twelve months ended december  compared to cash used in operations of million in the same period in the improvement is primarily due to increased sales during and a decrease in idle lease payments compared to year over year  unearned revenue increased to million at december   compared to million at december  unearned revenue represents the unrecognized value of paid or billed client subscriptions and content license contracts 
our solutions cater to a large number of small to medium sized businesses  many of which are involved in the construction market and may be adversely affected by the current tightening in the us credit market and the slowdown in the commercial and residential development market 
we are uncertain what the current economic situation may have had on our fourth quarter operating results and what impact it may have on our results in and beyond 
application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from client subscriptions and content licenses 
subscription revenues are generally prepaid at the beginning of the subscription term 
our subscription services are generally annual agreements  however  we also offer  on a limited basis  extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients 
content licenses are generally multi year agreements and are typically invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis 
subscription fees and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and list rental services 
revenue from these services is recognized upon delivery 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocated revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management information reports based on established list prices for those offerings 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions from our non enterprise clients whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date  as well as the invoiced portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with statement of position no 
 or sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during we abandoned  related to internal use software 
the abandoned assets relate to internal use code that was initially developed to enhance the functionality of existing products and internal workflow 
our technology team is currently undertaking an initiative to revise our technology platform to significantly enhance the functionality and scalability of new and existing products and processes 
as a result of this initiative  we no longer believe that the code originally developed will be compatible with the revised platform and we believe that these costs have no future value to the company 
the  abandonment represents the full capitalized value of these assets and is included in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the year ended december  non cash stock based compensation we account for non cash stock based compensation pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  or fas r  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class  and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
lease obligations in july  we entered into a tri party agreement with blume yale limited partnership  or blume  and the bill melinda gates foundation  or gates foundation  and a termination of lease agreement with blume providing for the simultaneous termination of our lease with blume and the addition of the space previously occupied by onvia to the gates foundation s lease agreement with blume 
the termination of our lease with blume was effective january  subsequent to the termination date  we have no further obligation on this space 
the letter of credit on our million security deposit was returned on march  concurrent with the termination of our blume lease  we entered into a new lease with gre olive llc  or gre  for approximately  square feet of corporate office space in a new building in seattle  washington 
the lease term expires in october delivery of the office space is staggered beginning in august through april base rental payments on the new lease are abated until october  however  pursuant to the guidance in sfas  accounting for leases  we began recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease beginning in august accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced portion of our enterprise contracts and content licenses once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable pursuant to the contract terms 
we do not record a receivable for the unbilled portion of our enterprise contracts or content licenses 
as of december  and  the unbilled portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses was approximately million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
contractual obligations future required payments under contracts  excluding operating expenses for our lease obligations  as of december  are as follows for the periods specified payments due by period total less than year years years more than years real estate operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital lease obligations other operating lease obligations total purchase obligations relate to software development agreements  co location hosting arrangements  telecom agreements  marketing agreements and third party content agreements 
capital lease obligations relate to server equipment and related maintenance agreements 
other operating lease obligations relate to office equipment leases 
consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses idle lease accrual total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net income loss comparison of years ended december   and revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily driven by an increase in acvc and revenue generated from our new management information report products 
the increase in acvc is attributable to increased adoption of our onvia business builder and onvia navigator products  upgrading clients into higher valued products and scheduled price increases 
if adoption of onvia business builder  onvia planning and construction and other anticipated new products is consistent with our expectations  we expect to continue to see improvement in our acvc as well as an increase in client retention rates in future periods 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in acvc for the same reasons discussed above 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  for a total increase of  in our cost of revenue consists primarily of payroll related expenses associated with collecting  categorizing and publishing our content  and also includes third party content fees and credit card processing fees 
third party content and credit card processing fees were approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue increased in total due primarily to increases of  in payroll and contract labor related expenses   in third party content costs  and  in recruiting fees 
payroll expenses increased as a result of normal performance based salary increases 
contract labor and third party content fees increased as a result of increased information requirements for new product initiatives 
weighted average headcount on our research team was flat at during and recruiting fees increased due to the recruitment of a new senior management role on our research team 
we expect to see continued increases in cost of revenue in as we add additional content and new products to our offering  however  we expect that gross margin will remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  third party content and credit card processing fees were approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue increased in total due in part to an increase of  in payroll related expenses as a result of headcount growth in our research team 
weighted average headcount on our research team was during  compared to during headcount increased as a result of increased content requirements for new products 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in third party content fees as a result of the expiration and renegotiation of content contracts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an aggregate increase of  although total sales and marketing expenses were relatively flat over the comparable periods  we did see changes in the following categories for our sales and marketing group payroll related expenses decreased by  as a result of a decrease in weighted average headcount to during  compared to during as a result of planned attrition 
non cash stock based compensation decreased  because we recognize this expense on an accelerated basis pursuant to the provisions of fin and the majority of our outstanding options were granted prior to we also increased our estimated forfeiture rate used to calculate non cash stock based compensation expense in  because we experienced an increase in actual forfeitures of options during compared to marketing expenses decreased  because we focused more of our marketing budget towards the development of our new website in and these costs were capitalized 
telecom expenses decreased  as a result of new telecom contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of  in allocated expenses and  in recruiting fees 
allocated expenses increased as a result of an overall increase in depreciation and amortization related to accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements due to our lease termination 
allocated expenses consist of depreciation  amortization and other allocated expenses  and they are allocated based on headcount in the respective departments 
recruiting fees increased as a result of fees incurred for filling senior leadership in our sales organization  including our new senior vice president of sales 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in total is attributable in part to an increase of million in payroll related expenses due to planned increases in headcount  increases in commissions due to higher sales in and normal merit increases 
weighted average headcount in our sales and marketing teams was in  compared to in we also saw increases of  in stock based compensation related to the adoption of fas r   in allocated expenses due to growth in headcount  and  in telecom expenses primarily attributable to the increased use of web conferencing under our new sales methodology 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in marketing related expenses due to a decrease in direct marketing expenses as a result of the implementation of a new sales methodology  and a decrease of  in consulting expenses 
consulting expenses incurred during related to fees to assist in the implementation of the new sales methodology and these fees were not incurred during technology and development technology and development expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in total is primarily attributable to increases of  in allocated expenses   in recruiting fees   in payroll related expenses  and  in travel expenses 
allocated expenses increased because of an overall increase in depreciation and amortization as discussed above 
recruiting fees increased because the competitive employment market in seattle necessitated the use of outside recruiters to fill open technology positions to a greater extent than in while weighted average headcount in this group decreased to in compared to in  payroll related expenses increased principally due to severance payments to our former chief information officer  normal performance based salary increases and a shift toward filling open positions with more senior level personnel on our technology team 
these increases were partially offset by an increase of  in capitalization of internal use software costs in compared to capitalized costs increased in because of a replatform initiative being undertaken by our technology group that is intended to make our overall technology platform more scalable  and because of the development of the new onvia planning and construction product 
technology and development expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in total is attributable to increases of  in payroll related expenses due to normal performance based increases and increases in recruiting fees for new hires  an increase of  in stock based compensation expense due to adoption of fas r  and an increase of  in amortization of software maintenance and license fees and other allocated expenses 
weighted average headcount in this group was in  compared to in capitalization of internal use software costs increased by  in compared to  partially offsetting the increases in total expenses discussed above 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
we saw increases in the following expense categories for the general and administrative group during  in payroll related expenses   in business taxes   in recruiting fees  and a write off of  in abandoned internal use software 
payroll expenses increased because of normal performance based increases and severance payments to our former general counsel 
weighted average headcount in this group was in both and business taxes increased as a result of increased revenue and recruiting fees increased because the competitive employment market in seattle required greater use of outside recruiters to fill open positions in the expense recorded for abandoned assets is discussed in more detail under application of critical accounting policies and management estimates above 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of  in non cash stock based compensation  and  in professional fees 
stock based compensation decreased because of the accelerated recognition of these expenses as discussed above 
professional fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in legal fees 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in total was primarily attributable to increases of  in stock based compensation due to the adoption of fas r  and  in payroll related expenses due to normal performance based salary increases  and increases in contract labor and consultants 
weighted average headcount in this group was in both and these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in recruiting fees due to fewer senior management hires in   in travel related expenses due to a reduction in travel  and  in insurance expenses due to a reduction in our insurance premiums 
non cash stock based compensation we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method beginning january  under this transition method  our reported stock based compensation expense includes a expense related to the remaining unvested portion of awards granted prior to january   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
using the black scholes valuation model  and b expense related to awards granted subsequent to january   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r using the black scholes valuation model 
we recognize compensation expense for all grants using the accelerated amortization method under fin fas r requires that stock based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  therefore  stock based compensation for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider trends of actual option forfeitures as well as expected future activity 
onvia s savings and retirement plan the retirement plan has a provision to allow a discretionary matching contribution  made in onvia common stock  equal to of every dollar up to of all eligible employee contributions 
matching contributions are made in the first quarter following each plan year  and employees must be employed on the last day of the plan year to be eligible to receive the matching contribution 
matching contributions were authorized for both the and plan years 
stock based compensation expense associated with these matches was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
we recorded  and million of non cash stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
idle lease charges onvia recorded net decreases to operating expenses of million and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to our idle lease accrual 
the decrease in was to eliminate the remaining balance in our idle lease accrual as a result of the termination of our lease on our former corporate headquarters building 
please refer to the discussion under lease obligations above for a detailed discussion of the adjustment to the idle lease accrual in the adjustment in was made to adjust our estimated accrual to the actual remaining obligation on the lease pursuant to the terms of a lease amendment in september the following table displays rollforwards of the idle lease accrual through december  amounts accruals at paid  net accruals at december  of sublease december  reduction income idle lease charges amounts accruals at paid  net accruals at december  of sublease december  reduction income idle lease charges interest and other income  net net interest and other income consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  letter of credit fees associated with our security deposits  interest expense and other miscellaneous income or expense 
net interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and are primarily attributable to an increase in short term interest rates compared to the previous years 
other income in was partially offset by a  loss on the settlement of a note receivable from our former chief strategy officer 
interest expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense in relates to capital leases for server equipment 
provision for income taxes we have incurred net operating losses  or nol  from our inception through the second quarter of because of this history of net operating losses  although we recorded net operating income for the fiscal year ended december   we do not currently believe that the future realization of the tax benefit associated with these net loss carryforwards is more likely than not  therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the likelihood that these tax benefits may be realized  and may reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance in the future if it is determined that realization of these benefits is more likely than not 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
the company plans to complete a section analysis regarding ownership changes that may have occurred  but at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate whether such a change has occurred 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at january  and december   the company had no unrecognized tax benefits 
accrued interest on tax positions is recorded as a component of interest expense  but is insignificant at december  based on information currently available  we do not reasonably believe that the unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly within the next twelve months 
net income and loss and adjusted net loss for the year ended december  we reported net income of  compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
net income for the year ended december  includes the impact of a series of lease transactions  which resulted in the reversal of million of our idle lease accrual offset by an increase of million in additional depreciation  rent expense and office relocation expenses 
please refer to the lease obligations discussion above for a more detailed discussion of these lease transactions 
the change from a net loss position to a net income position is primarily related to increases in revenue and containment of operating expenses as discussed above in conjunction with the impact of the lease transactions 
in addition to the discussion of our gaap net income  we believe it is important to discuss our net income on an adjusted basis exclusive of the impacts of our idle lease transactions to better demonstrate results from our core business 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our fiscal gaap net income and net loss to adjusted net loss  which excludes the impact of these transactions year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  as reported lease impact adjusted as reported lease impact adjusted as reported lease impact adjusted revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing technology and development general and administrative idle lease expense total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net income loss unrealized gain on available for sale securities comprehensive income loss basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted weighted average shares outstanding adjusted net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in and million in  representing an improvement of million  or in compared to the improved results in are due to increases in revenue and containment of operating costs as discussed above 
adjusted net loss in improved moderately compared to despite increases in operating expenses as discussed above because of an increase in revenue in compared to liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased  primarily due to the payment of million for reimbursable tenant improvements  which will be reimbursed to us during the first quarter of the outlay for these reimbursable tenant improvements was partially offset by the receipt of million for stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  and the maturity of million in long term investments 
we also used approximately million on payments for our previously idle office space 
we terminated the lease for this office space in and we will not incur fees associated with this space in although we generated positive cash flow from operations in  we may not be able to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future  however  we do expect to generate recurring positive cash flows from operations before we would be required to seek additional financing to fund operations by increasing client retention and acquisition  and increasing our acv 
until such time as we begin generating recurring positive cash flows from operations  we will utilize our current cash and cash equivalents and current revenues to fund operations 
we expect to increase revenue from current operations by increasing our acv through a combination of expansion of our product offering and scheduled price increases 
in july we entered into agreements to terminate the lease on our prior corporate headquarters building and entered into a new lease agreement for new office space 
the termination of our previous lease was effective upon relocation to our new office  which occurred in january as a result of these transactions  the security deposit of million on our previous lease was returned to us on march  in july  we issued a new security deposit of  for the new lease  which will be returned annually on a straight line basis over the next four years 
we expect cash flows over the original term of our previous lease through april to improve by approximately million as a result of these transactions  however  this improvement will be partially offset by approximately million in tenant improvement costs to build out the new office space 
these build out costs are expected to be incurred in the first half of please refer to the lease obligations discussion above for a more detailed description of these lease transactions 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change from net cash used in operating activities to net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in sales in compared to and a decrease in payments on our idle leased office space 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in cash collected for unearned revenue in compared to  and a reduction in the payment of prepaid expenses related to timing of payments 
these increases were partially offset by planned increases in operating expenses due to the implementation of our growth strategy related to additional headcount and new product initiatives 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of  and net cash provided by investing activities of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change to net cash provided by investing activities in from net cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to an increase in sales of investments in compared to this increase was partially offset by cash outflows of million in reimbursable tenant improvements and  for a security deposit on our new office lease 
we expect to be reimbursed for the tenant improvement costs in the first half of we also saw a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment in compared to the change to net cash used in investing activities in from net cash provided by investing activities in is primarily due to a decrease in sales and maturities of investments in compared to due to timing of investment maturity dates 
in addition to the decrease in sales and maturities  we saw an increase in the purchase of property and equipment in compared to as a result of additional requirements related to the deployment of new products and build out of our previous office space to accommodate existing staff in a new floor plan subsequent to a lease amendment 
these increases in net cash used were partially offset by the return of our security deposit on a lease for our previous corporate headquarters  which expired in august financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and was principally related to the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity prices  however  we consider our exposure to these risks to be insignificant 
interest rate risk we have assessed our susceptibility to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments 
we manage our interest rate risk by purchasing investment grade securities and diversifying our investment portfolio among issuers and maturities 
due to the fact that we carry only  in debt related to capital leases as of december   and due to our investment policies and the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our risk associated with interest rate fluctuations is negligible 
historically  our investment portfolio consisted of any or all of the following us denominated only money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities  auction rate securities and corporate debt securities with remaining maturities of thirteen months or less except auction rate securities  however  as of december   our investments consisted entirely of money market funds 
our primary investment objectives are preservation of principal  a high degree of liquidity and a maximum total return consistent with our investment objectives 
investments in us government and agency securities and money market funds investing in them are exempt from size limitations  all other securities are limited to of the portfolio at the time of purchase  per issuer 
in addition  the cumulative investments in an individual corporation  financial institution or financial institution s security are limited to million 
we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency risk exposure is insignificant  because all of our sales are currently denominated in us currency 
a portion of our nols are denominated in canadian dollars 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset associated with these nols  because realization of the future tax benefit is not currently likely  therefore  we believe our foreign currency risk exposure associated with these nols is insignificant 
equity price risk we do not own any significant equity instruments and we do not currently have plans to raise additional capital in the equity markets  therefore  our equity price risk is insignificant
