executive summary general tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages income from continuing operations was million cents per diluted share in compared with million cents per diluted share in gains on the sale of assets  investment write downs and other items and losses related to plant shutdowns  assets impairments and restructurings are described in results of operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page film products in film products  net sales were million in  up versus million in operating profit from ongoing operations was million in  up compared with million in volume decreased to million pounds in from million pounds in volume was down in compared with primarily due to a decrease in sales of commodity barrier films and packaging films  partially offset by an increase in sales of elastic materials used in baby diapers and adult incontinence products and apertured materials used as topsheet in feminine hygiene products 
certain commodity barrier films were discontinued in conjunction with the shutdown in the second quarter of of the plant in lagrange  georgia 
net sales increased primarily due to appreciation of the us dollar value of currencies for operations outside of the us  higher volume of elastic and apertured materials and improved product mix of surface protection films  partially offset by a decline in volume of commodity barrier films and a decline in volume and prices of certain packaging films 
we estimate that the growth in net sales excluding the effects of the pass through of resin price changes and foreign exchange rate changes was approximately in operating profit from ongoing operations in film products increased in versus primarily due to the net changes in sales noted above and appreciation of the us dollar value of currencies for operations outside of the us the benefit from currency rate changes was approximately million  partially offset by an estimated negative impact in of million from the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs and year end adjustments for lifo 
in  we estimated a favorable impact of million from the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs and year end adjustments for lifo 
future operating profit levels in films will depend on our ability to deliver product innovations and cost reductions to support growth in the sales of higher value surface protection films and to address competitive pressures facing our personal care and packaging materials businesses 
capital expenditures in film products were million in  down from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in depreciation expense was million in  up from million in  and is projected to be million in aluminum extrusions on february   we sold our aluminum extrusions business in canada for an estimated purchase price of million to an affiliate of hig capital 
the final purchase price is subject to increase or decrease to the extent that actual working capital  cash and indebtedness as defined as of february  are above or below the estimated amounts used to determine the estimated purchase price 
we expect to realize cash income tax benefits in from the sale of approximately million  which we recognized as a deferred income tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet at december  all historical results for the canadian business have been reflected as discontinued operations  however  cash flows for discontinued operations have not been separately disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows see note to the notes to financial statements for more information 
the sale of our aluminum extrusions business in canada  which was suffering from operating losses driven by lower volume and higher conversion costs from appreciation of the canadian dollar  allows us to focus on our us aluminum extrusions operations where we have more control over costs and profitability 
net sales from continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in operating profit from ongoing us operations decreased to million in  down from million in volume from continuing operations decreased to million pounds in  down from million pounds in the decreases in net sales and ongoing operating profit from continuing operations were mainly due to lower volume  partially offset by higher selling prices 
shipments declined in most markets  especially extrusions used in hurricane protection products and residential construction 
in addition  we began experiencing a softening of markets for extrusions used in non residential construction in the fourth quarter of overall backlog for continuing operations in aluminum extrusions at december  was down by approximately compared with december  capital expenditures for continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in in january  we announced plans to spend approximately million over the next months to expand the capacity at our plant in carthage  tennessee 
approximately of our sales of aluminum extrusions from our us operations are related to non residential construction  and this additional capacity will increase our capabilities in this sector 
depreciation expense for continuing operations was million in  up slightly from million in  and is projected to be million in other developments net pension income from continuing operations was million in  a favorable change of million cents per share after taxes from amounts recognized most of the favorable changes relate to a pension plan that is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the operating profit by segment table presented on page net pension income from continuing operations is expected to be million in we contributed approximately  to our pension plans for continuing operations in and expect to contribute a similar amount in interest expense was million in  a decline million cents per share after taxes versus due to lower average debt outstanding 
the effective tax rate used to compute income taxes from continuing operations was in compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate for continuing manufacturing operations for versus  which had an unfavorable impact of approximately cents per share  was mainly due to a valuation allowance for possible deferred tax benefits on capital loss carry forwards and lower income tax benefits expected for the extraterritorial income exclusion and domestic production activities deduction and the research and development r d tax credit 
during the first quarter of  we adopted new accounting standards for maintenance costs and uncertain income tax positions  neither of which had a material impact on tredegar s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we adopted new accounting standards on fair value measurements and the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  neither of which had an impact on historical results at the date of adoption 
on april   we invested million in harbinger capital partners special situations fund  lp harbinger  a fund that seeks to achieve superior absolute returns by participating primarily in medium to long term investments involving distressed high yield debt securities  special situation equities and private loans and notes 
the fund is a highly speculative investment subject to a two year lock up and additional limitations on withdrawal 
there is no secondary market for interests in the fund 
our investment in harbinger  which represents less than of harbinger s total partnership capital  is accounted for under the cost method 
at december   harbinger reported our capital account value at million reflecting million of unrealized appreciation million or cents per share after taxes versus the carrying value in our consolidated balance sheet of million 
on august   we invested million in a privately held drug delivery company representing ownership on a fully diluted basis of approximately 
this company is developing and commercializing state of the art drug delivery systems designed to improve patient compliance and outcomes 
during  we invested million in real estate 
at december   the carrying value in tredegar s balance sheet of its investments in this real estate and the drug delivery company equaled the respective amounts invested 
during we used a portion of a standing authorization from our board of directors to repurchase approximately million shares of our stock at an average price of per share 
despite the significant funds used for this program  our net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents at december  increased by only million to million due to strong cash flow from operations and lower capital expenditures net debt is not intended to represent debt as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  but is utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation and we believe that investors also may find net debt helpful for the same purposes 
on january   we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program whereby we are authorized at our discretion to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
this share repurchase program replaces our previous share repurchase authorization 
the authorization has no time limit 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december of each year 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of  in  million in and million in for asset impairments relating to discontinued operations  see note to the notes to financial statements 
investment accounted for under the fair value method on august   we invested million in a privately held drug delivery company representing ownership on a fully diluted basis of approximately 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives are similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   the fair value of our investment included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet equaled the amount invested 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the date of our investment august   we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to august   and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates drop to level inputs since there is no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  the company currently has no product sales 
accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or other significant financial transaction  value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 
as a result  an increase in our estimate of the fair value of our ownership interest is unlikely unless a significant new round of financing  merger or initial public offering indicates a higher value 
however  if the company does not meet its development and commercialization milestones and there are indications that the amount or timing of its projected cash flows or related risks are unfavorable versus plans as of august   or a new round of financing or other significant financial transaction indicates a lower value  then our estimate of the fair value of our ownership interest in the company is likely to decline 
pension benefits we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
our weighted average discount rate for continuing operations was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of  and a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
since  the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations has increased due to improved general market conditions after declining from to our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations has been since based on market and economic conditions and asset mix our expected return was in and in and prior years 
see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million as of december  included in this amount were million for tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which the timing of deductibility is uncertain 
because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting  other than interest  penalties and deductions not related to timing  a longer deductibility period would not affect the total income tax expense or the annual effective tax rate shown for financial reporting purposes  but would accelerate payments to the taxing authority 
tax payments resulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority for accelerated deductions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately million at december   net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
we anticipate that by december   we will settle several disputed issues raised by the internal revenue service the irs during its examination of our us income tax returns for  the most significant of which regards the recognition of our captive insurance subsidiary as an insurance company for us income tax purposes 
it is reasonably possible that a settlement with the irs for the disputed issues would cost us million  which would be applied against the balance of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties 
tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in us  state and foreign jurisdictions 
tredegar is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december   we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million

recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
is applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the new accounting standard for noncontrolling interests sometimes referred to as minority interests applies to all fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  early application is prohibited for both standards 
we currently do not have noncontrolling or minority interests in our consolidated financial statements 
we will apply the new standards when required and applicable

consolidated gross profit sales minus cost of goods sold and freight as a percentage of sales was in and in the gross profit margin increased in film products but decreased in aluminum extrusions primarily because of the changes in sales and volume

we believe that existing borrowing availability  our current cash balances and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and dividend requirements for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we enter into transactions with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of goods or services that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification would be subject to an assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances under the terms of the applicable agreement 
further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and significant

cash used in investing activities declined to million in compared with million in due to lower capital expenditures and proceeds from property disposals and reimbursements from a customer for purchases of equipment  partially offset by higher investments

see the assets and liabilities section beginning on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
see the executive summary beginning on page and the business segment review beginning on page for discussion regarding the impact of the lag in the pass through of resin price changes 
the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products is shown in the chart below 
line graph source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using monthly data provided by chemical data inc cdi 
in january  cdi reflected a cents per pound non market adjustment based on their estimate of the growth of discounts over the to period 
the th quarter average rate of cents per pound is shown on a pro forma basis as if the non market adjustment was made in october resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals
