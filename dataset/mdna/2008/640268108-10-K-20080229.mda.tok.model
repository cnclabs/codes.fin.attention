item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i item a of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops and enables differentiated therapeutics with our leading pegylation and pulmonary drug development technology platforms 
our mission is to create differentiated  innovative products by applying our platform technologies to established or novel medicines 
by doing so  we aim to raise the standards of current patient care by improving one or more performance parameters  including efficacy  safety or ease of use 
ten products using these technology platforms have received regulatory approval in the us or europe 
our two technology platforms are the basis of nearly all of our partnered and proprietary product and product candidates 
we create or enable potential breakthrough products in two ways 
first  we develop products in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek to improve and differentiate their products 
all of the approved products today that use our technology platforms are a result of collaborations with partners 
second  we develop our own product candidates by applying our technologies to already approved drugs to create and develop our own differentiated  proprietary product candidates that are designed to target serious diseases in novel ways 
we currently have two proprietary product candidates in mid stage clinical development and a number of other candidates in preclinical development 
our two leading technology platforms enable improved performance of a variety of new and existing molecules 
our pegylation technology is a chemical process designed to enhance the performance of most drug classes with the potential to improve solubility and stability  increase drug half life  reduce immune responses to an active drug and improve the efficacy or safety of a molecule in certain instances 
our pulmonary technology makes drugs inhaleable to deliver them to and through the lungs for both systemic and local lung applications 
there are two key elements to our business strategy 
first  we are developing a portfolio of proprietary product candidates by applying our pegylation and pulmonary technology platforms and know how to improving already approved drugs 
our strategy is to identify molecules that would benefit from the application of our technologies and potentially improve one or more performance parameters  including efficacy  safety and ease of use 
our objective is to create value by advancing these product candidates into clinical development and then deciding on a product by product basis whether we wish to continue development and commercialize on our own or seek a partner  or pursue a combination of these approaches 
our most advanced proprietary product candidates are nktr peg irinotecan for the treatment of solid tumors  including colorectal cancer  and nktr oral peg naloxol for the treatment of opioid induced bowel dysfunction  both of which entered phase clinical development in late second  we have collaborations or licensing arrangements with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our partnering strategy enables us to work towards developing a larger and more diversified pipeline of drug products and product candidates using our technologies 
as we have shifted our focus away from being a drug delivery service provider and have advanced research and development of our proprietary product pipeline  we expect to engage in selected high value partnerships in order to optimize revenue potential  probability of success and overall return on investment 
our partnering options range from a comprehensive license to a co promotion and co development arrangement with the structure of the partnership depending on factors such as the cost and complexity of development  commercialization needs  and therapeutic area focus 

table of contents historically  we have depended on revenue from pfizer related to exubera contract research and manufacturing 
our revenue from pfizer  including exubera contract research and manufacturing revenue  was approximately million and million  representing and of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   pfizer announced that it was exiting the exubera business and gave notice of termination under the collaborative development and licensing agreement 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement and mutual release with pfizer 
under the termination agreement and mutual release  we received a one time payment of million in november from pfizer in satisfaction of all outstanding contractual obligations under our then existing agreements relating to exubera and our next generation inhaled insulin product development program  also known as ngi 
in addition  pfizer agreed to continue to perform a number of maintenance activities for exubera and ngi for a limited time and to transfer all of its rights to exubera and ngi if we find a new marketing and development partner within a certain time period as described more fully below 
all agreements between pfizer and us related to exubera and ngi  other than the termination agreement and mutual release  terminated on november  we are currently seeking a new marketing and development partner for exubera and or ngi 
under the termination agreement and mutual release  if we identify a potential new marketing and development partner for exubera and or ngi within a certain time period  pfizer will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete an agreement with the potential new partner pursuant to which pfizer will transfer all of its rights in exubera and or ngi to the partner without additional consideration including without any prospective economic value  such as a royalty or profit sharing  other than reimbursement of certain out of pocket and incremental costs actually incurred by pfizer in relation to maintenance and transfer activities performed by pfizer 
in addition  pfizer has agreed to undertake a number of activities designed to transition all of its rights in exubera and ngi to a new partner for at least three months following completion of an agreement with the new partner  if any  or such longer transition period as regulatory requirements may require  subject to reimbursement of certain out of pocket and incremental costs actually incurred by pfizer 
in addition  in january  we entered into a letter agreement with pfizer to maintain a group of key pfizer manufacturing personnel in pfizer s exubera manufacturing facility in terre haute  indiana 
the purpose of this arrangement is to provide potential partners for exubera and or ngi with the opportunity to have manufacturing performed in pfizer s indiana manufacturing facility in the event that a new partner reaches a mutually satisfactory arrangement with pfizer 
we are reimbursing pfizer for actual monthly incremental personnel costs incurred to maintain such personnel during this interim period 
in response to lower expected revenue levels in resulting from the termination of the pfizer agreements related to exubera and ngi  we have taken steps to reduce ongoing expense related to exubera and ngi while maintaining our exubera and ngi manufacturing and development capabilities until such time as a collaboration agreement with a new partner is concluded or we cease our partnering efforts 
as discussed below under the caption  recent developments  we have terminated our manufacturing and supply agreement with our contract manufacturers that manufactured and supplied us with the exubera inhalers and reduced our workforce 
we also have a continuation agreement with one of the contract manufacturers  tech group north america  inc  to preserve manufacturing capacity and expertise to support a new partner for the exubera inhaler if we secure a new partner for exubera within a certain time period and such partner desires to enter into a new manufacturing and supply agreement with tech group 
we are currently engaged in discussions with third parties regarding a potential partnership for exubera and or ngi 
if we are able to secure a new partner  utilization of our exubera related assets depends on such partner s desire to enter into a manufacture and supply agreement with tech group and to utilize our san carlos facility to manufacture exubera inhalation powder 
we currently expect to conclude whether or not we will have a new partner for exubera and or ngi in the first half of if we are not successful in concluding a new partnership for exubera and or ngi  we will eliminate the remaining costs and infrastructure associated with these programs 

table of contents the investment required to advance our proprietary product development programs  our ability to manage ongoing expense and the cash generated by new partnerships  if any  will be the key drivers of our results of operations and financial position in to fund our research and development activities  we have raised significant amounts of capital through the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities 
as of december   we had approximately million in indebtedness 
our ability to meet the repayment obligations of this debt is dependent upon our and our partners ability to develop  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize products 
even if we are successful in this regard  we may require additional capital to repay our debt obligations as they become due 
recent developments workforce reduction during the year ended december   we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately percent of our regular full time employees  as part of an overall effort to reduce our ongoing operating costs and improve our organizational structure  efficiency and productivity 
no research and development programs were curtailed due to the workforce reduction 
the cost of the workforce reduction was approximately million  of which million was paid in and million will be paid in we estimate that the reduced salaries and benefits from the workforce reduction will result in gross annual savings of million  a portion of which we began to realize in the fourth quarter of within research and development and general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   workforce reduction charges were recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of goods sold  net of change in inventory research and development expense general and administrative expense total workforce reduction charges on february   executive management approved a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately percent of our regular full time employees 
the restructuring is designed to streamline our operations  consolidate corporate functions  and strengthen decision making and execution within the business units 
in addition  as part of the plan  we have preserved the necessary technical and manufacturing personnel and capabilities to support our ongoing effort to forge a new partnership for our inhaled insulin programs 
we estimate the workforce reduction will cost approximately million in  comprised of cash payments for severance  medical insurance  and outplacement services 
the severance charge associated with this plan will be recorded as a one time expense in february  except for a few employees with transition dates longer than days 
for these employees  the severance expense will be recorded ratably over the estimated transition period 
in addition to the full time employees terminated as part of the and workforce reductions  we eliminated open and temporary positions 
change in executive management and the board of directors on february   hoyoung huh  md ph 
d  our chief operating officer and head of the pegylation business unit  resigned from his positions effective as of february  on february   the board of directors met and appointed dr 
huh as a new director to fill the vacancy created by resolution of the board of directors at the same meeting to increase the authorized number of 
table of contents directors from to dr 
huh will serve until the annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor is duly elected and qualified 
termination of agreement with contract manufacturers we were a party to a manufacturing and supply agreement exubera inhaler msa with tech group north america  inc and bespak europe ltd 
related to the manufacture and supply of exubera inhalers 
on february   we entered into a termination and continuation agreement tca with tech group 
under the terms of this agreement  we have agreed to pay tech group up to million for costs and expenses that were due and payable by us under the terms of the exubera inhaler msa 
additionally  under the terms of the tca we agreed to compensate tech group to retain a limited number of core exubera inhaler manufacturing personnel and its dedicated exubera inhaler manufacturing facility for a limited period in on february   we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with bespak pursuant to which the exubera inhaler msa was terminated in its entirety and we agreed to pay bespak million  or approximately million  in satisfaction of outstanding accounts payable and termination costs and expenses that were due and payable under the terms of the exubera inhaler msa 
research and development activities our product pipeline includes both partnered and proprietary development programs 
we have ongoing collaborations or licensing arrangements with more than twenty biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to provide our pulmonary and pegylation technologies 
our technologies are currently being used in ten products approved in the us or europe  in three partner programs that have been filed for with the fda  and twelve development programs in human clinical trials 
the length of time that a development program is in a given phase varies substantially according to factors relating to the development program  such as the type and intended use of the potential product  the clinical trial design  and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
generally  for partnered programs  advancement from one phase to the next and the related costs to do so is dependent upon factors that are primarily controlled by our partners 
in connection with our research and development for partner products and development programs  we earned million  million  and million in contract research revenue for the years ending december    and  respectively 
the estimated completion dates and costs for our programs are not reasonably certain 
see risk factors for discussion of the risks associated with our partnered and proprietary research and development programs and the timing and risks associated with clinical development

revenue from pfizer represented of our total revenue for the year ended december   no other single customer represented or more of our total revenues during this period 
on october   pfizer announced that it was exiting the exubera business and gave notice of termination under our collaborative development and licensing agreement and certain other related agreements the pfizer agreements 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement and mutual release with pfizer  in which we received a one time payment of million in satisfaction of all outstanding contractual obligations to and from pfizer under the pfizer agreements 
we will not receive any revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi in the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in exubera product sales to pfizer  partially offset by a decrease in contract research revenue from pfizer 
pfizer represented and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  no other single customer represented or more of our total revenues during these periods 
product sales and royalties product sales and royalties increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increased exubera product sales to pfizer  as well as certain modifications to the timing of revenue recognition 
exubera product sales to pfizer increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  exubera commercial sales began in january during  we deferred recognition of all exubera product sales until pfizer s contractual day right of return period lapsed 
as a result  as of december  we deferred million in exubera product sales and we recognized ten months of product shipments in revenue 
in january  we began estimating product warranty returns and recognizing exubera product sales upon shipment 
during the year ended december   we recognized product sales through november   when our collaboration agreements with pfizer terminated  as well as the revenue deferred at december  we will not have any future exubera product sales to pfizer in 
table of contents during the year ended december   royalty revenue decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  this decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in royalties related to macugen sales by osi 
the increase in product sales and royalties for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to an increase in exubera product sales to pfizer after the approval of exubera in january also contributing to the increase was approximately million in product sales and royalties from our pegylation products 
royalty revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
contract research contract research revenue includes reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and milestone payments received from our collaboration partners 
contract research revenue fluctuates from year to year  and therefore future contract research revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract research revenues depends in part upon the continuation of existing collaborations  signing of new collaborations  the stage of program development  and the achievement of milestones 
the increase in contract research revenue during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to increased revenue from pfizer of million 
the increase in contract research revenue from pfizer includes a net decrease in research revenue of million related to exubera and ngi in and recognition of million in ngi up front fees upon termination of the pfizer agreements 
additionally  contract research revenue from novartis and bayer increased by million and million  respectively  under our collaboration agreements to develop a tobramycin inhalation powder tip with novartis and ciprofloxacin and nktr inhaled amikacin with bayer 
these increases in contract research revenue were partially off set by decreased revenue from zelos of million under our collaboration agreement to develop ostabolin c 
due to the termination of the pfizer agreements discussed above  we do not expect to receive any contract research revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi in the decrease in contract research revenue during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a million decrease in pfizer contract research revenue after the fda and emea approval of exubera in january  and the transition from research and clinical trial support to manufacturing of commercial product 
the decrease in research revenue from pfizer was partially offset by a million increase in contract research revenues from novartis for tip and a million increase from baxter healthcare  under our agreement to develop a product to extend the half life of hemophilia a proteins using our pegylation technology

during the years ended december  and  exubera contributed million and million  respectively  to our product gross margin 
the increase in cost of goods sold and product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is consistent with the proportionate increase in exubera product sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to product mix  our cost plus manufacturing arrangement with pfizer  and the decline in royalty revenue of million during the increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to increased exubera product sales

during the year ended december   we amortized the remaining exubera commercialization costs through october and did not incur any additional costs 
during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the decrease in exubera commercialization readiness revenue and costs was primarily due to the transition from readiness preparation to commercial production in late and early we will not incur any additional exubera commercialization readiness costs or recognize any additional exubera commercialization readiness revenue in or beyond

table of contents on november   we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with pfizer in respect of terminating all of our exubera and ngi related agreements 
we are currently engaged in efforts to secure another collaboration partner to continue the commercialization of exubera and or the development of ngi 
as a result  we performed a sfas impairment analysis of the property and equipment that support exubera commercial operations and ngi development activities referred to as exubera related assets  including machinery and equipment at our contract manufacturer locations and machinery  equipment  and leasehold improvements at our san carlos  california headquarters 
if we are able to secure a new collaboration partner for exubera and or ngi  utilization of our exubera related assets will depend on any such partner s desire to utilize our san carlos facility to manufacture exubera bulk dry powder insulin and whether such partner enters into a manufacturing and supply agreement with tech group to manufacture and supply exubera inhalers 
given that we have not entered into a collaboration agreement and that uncertainties associated with future supply chain decisions exist  we concluded that the carrying value of the exubera related assets exceeds the estimated future cash flows 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended december  for the exubera related assets 
during the year ended december   impairment of long lived assets includes a write off of million of certain intangible assets relating to our ireland operations  million relating to the remaining laboratory and office equipment at our bradford  uk location  and million relating to an asset being constructed for use in one of our partnered pulmonary programs 
in december  we were apprised of unfavorable results of clinical data related to programs from our super critical fluids technology program in bradford uk  which provided an indication that the fair value of the respective business unit s goodwill was below the carrying value 
we re performed the impairment analysis of goodwill and other long lived assets for bradford uk and determined the fair value of the intangibles and other assets of nektar uk based on a discounted cash flow model to be less than the carrying value

as of december   due to pfizer s termination of the exubera program and our inability to provide bespak and tech group with future exubera inhaler manufacturing commitments  we had a contractual liability for termination costs and expenses that would be incurred by bespak and tech group 
on february   we entered into a termination and continuation agreement tca with tech group pursuant to which the exubera inhaler msa was terminated in its entirety 
we have recorded million as termination liabilities under the terms of the tca 
in the event that we successfully identify a new exubera commercialization partner and such partner does enter into an exubera inhaler supply agreement with tech group  we would be relieved of our obligation to pay tech group up to million this amount 
due to the uncertainty regarding the prospects of securing a new commercialization partner for exubera and uncertainty over whether such partner will desire to enter into an exubera inhaler manufacturing agreement with tech group  we believe that the potential future reduction in our obligation is a contingent gain to be recorded when and if those events occurs 
on february   we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with bespak pursuant to which the exubera inhaler msa was terminated in its entirety and we agreed to pay bespak million or approximately million  including million of accrued expenses and million in termination costs and expenses that were due and payable under the terms of the exubera inhaler msa

however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of commercial debt securities  with an average time to maturity of days 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we have the ability and intent to hold our debt securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at full par value 
accordingly  we consider unrealized losses to be temporary and have not recorded a provision for impairment
