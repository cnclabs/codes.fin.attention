our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors which could include the follo wing i changes in demand in the dry bulk market  including  without limitation  changes in production of  or demand for  commodities and bulk cargoes  generally or in particular regions  ii greater than anticipated levels of dry bulk vessel new building orders or lower than anticipated rates of dry bulk vessel scrapping  iii changes in rules and regulations applicable to the dry bulk industry  including  without limitation  legislation adopted by international bodies or organizations such as the international maritime organization and the european union or by individual countries  iv actions taken by regulatory authorities  v changes in trading patterns significantly impacting overall dry bulk tonnage requirements  vi changes in the typical seasonal variations in dry bulk charter rates  vii changes in the cost of other modes of bulk commodity transportation  viii changes in general domestic and international political conditions  ix changes in the condition of the company s vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards which may affect  among other things  our anticipated dry docking costs  x and other factors listed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission

overview we are eagle bulk shipping inc  a republic of marshall islands corporation headquartered in new york city 
we own one of the largest fleets of supramax dry bulk vessels in the world 
supramax dry bulk vessels range in size from  to  dwt 
we transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes  including iron ore  coal  grain  cement and fertilizer  along worldwide shipping routes 
as of december   we owned and operated a modern fleet of handymax dry bulk vessels  of which are of the supramax class 
in addition to our operating fleet of vessels  we have contracted for the construction of newbuilding vessels in japan and china  deliveries of which 
table of contents are scheduled to commence in mid upon delivery of all newbuilding vessels by early  our total fleet will consist of vessels with a combined carrying capacity of million dwt 
we are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in one vessel type handymax dry bulk carriers and its sub category of supramax vessels which are handymax vessels ranging in size from  to  dwt 
fifteen of the vessels in our operating fleet are classified as supramax dry bulk vessels 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of panamax dry bulk vessels  which range in size from  to  dwt and must rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to potential charterers 
the vessels in our operating fleet have a combined carrying capacity of  dwt and an average age of approximately years  as compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of over years 
our financial performance is based on the following key elements of our business strategy

our strategy is to concentrate in one vessel category handymax dry bulk vessels  especially its supramax class of vessels  which offer size  operational and geographical advantages over panamax and capesize vessels

spacer

spacer 
gif 
our strategy is to charter our vessels primarily pursuant to one to three year time charters to allow us to take advantage of the stable cash flow and high utilization rates that are associated with medium to long term time charters 
reliance on the spot market contributes to fluctuations in revenue  cash flow  and net income 
on the other hand  time charters provide a shipping company with a predictable level of revenues 
we have entered into time charters for all of our vessels which range in length from one to three years and provide for fixed semi monthly payments in advance 
we have also entered into contracts with fixed minimum rates and profit sharing arrangements  enabling us to benefit from an increasing rate environment while still minimizing downside risk 
this strategy is effective in strong and weak dry bulk markets  giving us security and predictability of cashflows relative to the volatility inherent in shipping markets

vessel build and delivery dates are estimates based on guidance received from shipyard 
the date range represents the earliest and latest date on which the charterer may redeliver the vessel to the company upon the termination of the charter 
the time charter hire rate presented are gross daily charter rates before brokerage commissions ranging from to to third party ship brokers 
the charterer has an option to extend the charter by periods of to months each 
options for construction declared on december  market overview the international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with many market participants 
there are approximately  drybulk carriers of over  dwt aggregating approximately million dwt  and the ownership of these vessels is divided among approximately  mainly private independent dry bulk vessel owners with no one shipping group owning or controlling more than of the world bulker fleet 
we primarily compete with other owners of dry bulk vessels in the handymax and handysize class and panamax class sectors that are mainly privately owned fleets 
competition in virtually all bulk trades is intense and based primarily on supply and demand 
such demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities  production and consumption patterns  as well as events which interrupt production  trade routes and consumption 
we compete for charters on the basis of price  vessel location  size  age and condition of the vessel  as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator 
increasingly  major customers are demonstrating a preference for modern vessels based on concerns about the environmental and operational risks associated with older vessels 
consequently  owners of large modern fleets have gained a competitive advantage over owners of older fleets 

table of contents our strategy is to concentrate in one vessel category of the dry bulk segment of the shipping industry the handymax sector 
handymax dry bulk vessels range in size from  to  dwt 
within the handymax sector  the industry has migrated to a larger size of vessel class called the supramax class of dry bulk vessels which range in size from  dwt to  dwt 
vessel 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of panamax dry bulk vessels  which range in size from  to  dwt and must rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to potential charterers 
fifteen of the vessels in our operating fleet as of december  are classified as supramax vessels 
all of the vessels under construc tion are also supramax class vessels 

html barchartjpg 
the supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook  the fleet age profile  and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet 
as of january  of the world handymax fleet is years or older 
the handymax vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately years as of december   compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of over years 
the handymax newbuilding orderbook currently stands at of the world handymax fleet

the handymax market the primary driver for the dry bulk shipping industry continues to be sustained demand in east asia led by strong demand for commodities in china and increasingly india 
demand for vessels is further boosted by port congestion and shifts in trade patterns which increase distances or ton miles  especially the port infrastructure bottlenecks and recent changes in weather patterns in commodity resource rich australia 
these port delays are resulting in grain  ores and coal being shipped from increasing distances as importers turn to other producers 
the boom in commodity trades since saw dry bulk shipping rates reach even greater peaks during most of before abruptly slowing towards the end of the year as the credit crisis brought in uncertainty in drybulk shipping rates 
an additional factor in the uncertainty was the drawn out intense negotiations over iron ore contract pricing between importing countries and miners 
we believe industry fundamentals remain attractive as ongoing global economic activity continues to foster demand for drybulk commodities 
robust chinese steel demand continues to stimulate iron ore and coal trade growth  and pricing of iron ore contracts for will only bring certainty to drybulk shipping rates 
global infrastructure building programs have also boosted trade of minor bulks such as cement 
minor bulks provide a secure  protective market for handymax vessels vastly benefiting the supramax class with their superior cargo capacity and gear 
additionally due to longer haul routes  ton mile demand is increasing at a faster pace than trade growth 
on the supply side  however  there has been a surge in drybulk newbuildings with the peak supply period being which will calibrate the drybulk demand and supply balance 
lack of historical operating data for vessels before their acquisition consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is no historical financial due diligence process when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our common stock in assessing our business or profitability 
most vessels are sold under a standardized agreement  which  among other 
table of contents things  provides the buyer with the right to inspect the vessel and the vessel s classification society records 
the standard agreement does not give the buyer the right to inspect  or receive copies of  the historical operating data of the vessel 
prior to the delivery of a purchased vessel  the seller typically removes from the vessel all records  including past financial records and accounts related to the vessel 
in addition  the technical management agreement between the seller s technical manager and the seller is automatically terminated and the vessel s trading certificates are revoked by its flag state following a change in ownership 
consistent with shipping industry practice  we treat the acquisition of a vessel whether acquired with or without charter as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
although vessels are generally acquired free of charter  we have acquired and may in the future acquire some vessels with time charters 
where a vessel has been under a voyage charter  the vessel is delivered to the buyer free of charter  and it is rare in the shipping industry for the last charterer of the vessel in the hands of the seller to continue as the first charterer of the vessel in the hands of the buyer 
in most cases  when a vessel is under time charter and the buyer wishes to assume that charter  the vessel cannot be acquired without the charterer s consent and the buyer s entering into a separate direct agreement with the charterer to assume the charter 
the purchase of a vessel itself does not transfer the charter  because it is a separate service agreement between the vessel owner and the charterer 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for a description of all our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition we currently generate all of our revenue from time charters 
time charters are for a specific period of time at a specific rate per day or month  and are generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of our vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation 
we depreciate our dry bulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual salvage value 
salvage  or scrap  value is based upon a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
we use a scrap rate of per lwt  which we believe is common in the dry bulk shipping industry  to compute each vessel s salvage value 
an increase in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of increasing the an nual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  the vessel s useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective 
the estimated scrap value is used in the computation of depreciation expense and recoverability of the carrying value of each vessel when evaluating for impairment of vessels 
management s estimates for salvage values may differ from actual results 
the carrying values of the company s vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter 
table of contents rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
we evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flow for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptio ns are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
in the event that an impairment were to occur  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis 
deferred drydock cost there are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings  a the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock  and b expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
we use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses 
under the deferral method  drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis until the next drydock  which we estimate to be a period of two to three years 
we believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred 
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in deferral drydock is written off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted 
we expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
costs capitalized as part of the drydocking include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard and parts and supplies used in making such repairs 
vessel acquisitions where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows 
we value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us 
where we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates  we record a liability in deferred revenues based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
conversely  where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates  we record an asset in prepaid charter revenue  based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
this determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us  and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter 
the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates  expected future charter rates  future vessel operation expenses  the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital 
the use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results 
table of contents of operations 
in the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us  our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected 
results of operations for the years ended december  and  and period from january  inception to december  factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following

ownership days we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us 
ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
ownership days in increased by the delivery of three vessels in the second quarter of  net of the sale of one vessel in the first quarter of in  we added three vessels to our initial fleet of vessels 
the increase in ownership days in resulted from the additional three vessels and operations for the ful l calendar year of vessels acquired in

available days we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition  scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
the shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
available days in increased due to a larger fleet size  net of positioning one vessel for sale and drydocks 
available days in increased due to larg er fleet size 
in  five of our vessels drydocked compared to six in we incurred less than one takeover day for the additional acquisitions in during the period the fleet was in operation in  we drydocked one vessel and incurred eleven days in vessel takeover days

operating days we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to any reason  including unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues

fleet utilization we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates

tce rates we define tce rates as our voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time

charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
all our vessels are employed on time charters hence our tce rate is equal to the time charter rate 
voyage and time charter revenue shipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
in the drybulk sector of the shipping industry  rates for the transportation of drybulk cargoes such as ores  grains  steel  fertilizers  and similar commodities  are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for shipments then is significantly affected by the state of the economy globally and in discrete geographical areas 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  we manage our vessels based on time charter equivalent tce revenues 
tce revenue comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters  or tc revenue  and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market 
tce revenue serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results between geographical regions and among competitors 
our economic decisions are based on anticipated tce rates and we evaluate financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of the daily charter hire rates that our vessels earn under charters  which  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including

all our revenues for the years ended december  and december  and december  were earned from time charters  hence our tce revenue is equal to the tc revenue 
as is common in the shipping industry  we pay commissions ranging from to of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in house brokers associated with the charterers  depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter 
net revenues for the year ended december  of  included billed time charter revenues of  deductions for brokerage commissions of  and amortization of prepaid revenue of  net revenues for the year ended december  were greater than net revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to a larger fleet size as reflected by increased operating days and an increase in daily time charter rates

net revenues for the year ended december  of  included billed time charter revenues of  deductions for brokerage commissions of  and amortization of prepaid revenue of  voyage expenses to the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters  we will incur expenses that include port and canal charges  bunker fuel oil expenses and commissions  as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters 
port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessels 
currently all our vessels are employed under time charters that require the charterer to bear all of those expenses  hence we expect that any port and canal charges and bunker expenses  if incurred  will represent a relatively minor portion of our vessels overall expenses

table of contents foreign currency swaps the shipping industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
all our revenues and the majority of our operating expenses and the entirety of our management expenses are in us dollars 
therefore we do not use or intend to use financial derivatives to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for our revenues and expenses 
however  as we have entered into a newbuilding program for vessels to be built in japan and which are priced in japanese yen  we have entered into foreign exchange swap transactions to hedge foreign currency risks to our vessel newbuilding contracts 
these swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges

ebitda is included because it is used by certain investors to measure a company s financial performance 
ebitda is not an item recognized by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income  cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
ebitda is presented to provide additional information with respect to the company s ability to satisfy its obligations including debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements  the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other com panies due to differences in methods of calculation 
our amended revolving credit facility permits us to pay dividends in amounts up to cumulative free cash flows which is our earnings before extraordinary or exceptional items  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization credit agreement ebitda  less the aggregate amount of interest incurred and net amounts payable under interest rate hedging agreements during the relevant period and an agreed upon reserve for dry docking 
therefore  we believe that this non gaap measure is important for our investors as it reflects our ability to pay dividends

the balance of the contract price in us dollars for the newbuilding vessels which are to be constructed and delivered between august and april the company is a party to floating to fixed interest rate swaps covering notional amounts of        and  as of december  that effectively convert the company s interest rate exposure from a floating rate based on libor to a fixed rate of       and respectively  plus applicable margin 
interest and borrowing fees includes capitalized interest for the newbuilding vessels 
remainder of the lease on the office space which we occupy 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels 
we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
as of december   our fleet currently consists of supramax vessels which are currently operational and newbuilding vessels which have been contracted for construction 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  the company s other major capital expenditures include funding the company s maintenance program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
although the company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its dry docking  the costs are relatively predictable 
management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years 
funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations 
we anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities  which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period 
drydocking costs incurred are amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking for those vessels are scheduled to occur 
in  five of our 
table of contents vessels passed drydock surveys 
in  six of our vessels passed drydock surveys 
for and  we spent  and  respectively on vessel drydockings 
the following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters  along with the anticipated off hire days
