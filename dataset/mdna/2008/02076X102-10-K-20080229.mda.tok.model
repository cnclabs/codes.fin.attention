item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and our selected historical financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
the historical financial information discussed below for periods prior to the completion of our internal restructuring on february  is for anr fund ix holdings  lp and alpha nr holding  inc and subsidiaries on a combined basis  which prior to the completion of our internal restructuring were the owners of a majority of the membership interests of anr holdings  our top tier holding company  and for alpha natural resources  inc and subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for periods from and after the completion of our internal restructuring 
overview we produce  process and sell steam and metallurgical met coal from eight regional business units  which  as of december   are supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and preparation plants located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  and pennsylvania  as well as a road construction business in west virginia and virginia that recovers coal 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
our sales of steam coal during and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states  and our sales of met coal during those years were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia and south america 
approximately of our sales revenue in and of our sales revenue in was derived from sales made outside the united states  primarily in canada  egypt  belgium  italy  hungary and brazil 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales  equipment repair  road construction  rentals  royalties  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  and coal and environmental analysis fees 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to our customers  which we treat as being reimbursed by our customers 
however  these freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our business is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we generally experience lower sales and hence build coal inventory during the winter months primarily due to the freezing of lakes that we use to transport coal to some of our customers 
our primary expenses are for wages and benefits  supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we have one reportable segment  coal operations  which includes all of our revenues and costs from coal production and sales  freight and handling  rentals  commissions  coal handling and processing operations and coal recovery incidental to our road construction operations 
these revenues and costs included in our coal operations segment are reported by us in our coal revenues and cost of coal sales  except for the revenues and costs from rentals  commissions  and coal handling and processing operations  which we report in our other revenues and cost of other revenues  respectively 

table of contents internal restructuring and our initial public offering 
on february   we completed a series of transactions in connection with the internal restructuring for the purpose of transitioning our top tier holding company from a limited liability company to a corporation  and on february   we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
further information regarding our internal restructuring and our initial public offering can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
as a result of our initial public offering and our internal restructuring  we have incurred during the period after the initial public offering and internal restructuring and will continue to incur additional expenses that we did not incur in prior periods  including expenses associated with compliance with corporate governance and periodic financial reporting requirements for public companies 
moreover  all of our income is now subject to income tax and therefore the effective tax rates reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to the internal restructuring are not indicative of our effective tax rates after our internal restructuring 
as part of our internal restructuring  our executive officers and certain other key employees exchanged their interests in anr holdings for shares of our common stock and the right to participate in a distribution of the proceeds we received from the underwriters as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option in connection with the initial public offering 
as a result  we recorded stock based compensation expense equal to the fair value of the unrestricted shares issued and distributions paid in the amount of million for the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the conversion of outstanding options held by members of our management to purchase units of alpha coal management acm into the acm converted options  we recorded stock based compensation of million in the aggregate amount of stock based compensation expense we recorded in was million  equal to the million of expense associated with distributions paid and the vested portions of shares issued in the internal restructuring and amortization expense from the unvested portions of shares issued in the internal restructuring  and million of amortization expense from the acm converted options 
in addition  we had deferred stock based compensation of million  including million and million related to our internal restructuring and the acm converted options  respectively  that we will record as non cash stock based compensation expense over the remaining term of the applicable two year and five year vesting periods  respectively  thereby reducing our earnings in those periods 
in connection with our internal restructuring  we assumed the obligation of anr holdings to make distributions to affiliates of amci in an aggregate amount of million  representing the approximate incremental tax resulting from the recognition of additional tax liability resulting from our internal restructuring  and first reserve fund ix  lp in an aggregate amount of approximately million  representing the approximate value of tax attributes conveyed as a result of the internal restructuring collectively  the tax distributions 
the tax distributions to affiliates of amci were paid in cash in five equal installments of million on april   june   september   january  and april  the tax distributions to first reserve fund ix  lp are in three installments of approximately million  million  and million on december   and  respectively 
the installment was paid in cash 
we will pay the remaining two installments in cash or  to the extent our subsidiaries are not permitted by the terms of our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes to distribute cash to us to pay the tax distributions  in shares of our common stock 
nkc disposition 
on april   we sold the assets of nkc to an unrelated third party for cash in the amount of million  plus an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of nkc s coal inventory  and the assumption by the buyer of certain liabilities of nkc 
for the six months ended june   nkc contributed revenues of million  an after tax and minority interest loss of million on sales of million tons of steam coal sold 
in connection with the closing of the transaction  national king coal  llc was renamed natcoal llc  and gallup transportation and transloading company  llc was renamed gttc llc 
we recorded a gain on this sale in of million and have reported nkc as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein 
nicewonder acquisition and financing

for this purpose  the value of the common stock issued was based on the average closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days surrounding october   the date the number of shares to be issued under the terms of the acquisition agreement became fixed without subsequent revision 
in connection with the nicewonder acquisition  we also agreed to make royalty payments to the former owners of the acquired companies in the amount of per ton of coal mined and sold from white flame energy s surface mine no 
the nicewonder acquisition consisted of the purchase of the outstanding capital stock of white flame energy  inc  twin star mining  inc 
and nicewonder contracting  inc  the equity interests of powers shop  llc and buchanan energy  llc and substantially all of the assets of mate creek energy of w

the first of two planned rotary pre heater lime kilns is expected to be in production in the first quarter and will produce lime to be sold primarily to coal burning utilities as a scrubbing agent for removing sulfur dioxide from flue gas  helping them to meet increasingly stringent air quality standards under the federal clean air act 
the lime will also be sold to steel producers for use as flux in electric arc and basic oxygen furnaces 
the minority owners were granted restricted member interests in gallatin  which vest based on performance criteria approximately three years from the closing date and which  if earned in their entirety  would reduce our ownership to 
approximately million was spent on capital expenditures by gallatin during as of december   gallatin borrowed million for project financing

the mingo logan purchase consists of coal reserves  one active deep mine and a load out and processing plant  which is managed by our callaway business unit 

table of contents coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook conditions in the thermal and the metallurgical coal markets  both in north america and worldwide  are solidly in favor of coal producers 
thermal coal exports from the us are expected to increase again in in the wake of continued weakness in the us dollar and disruptions in operations and shipping in a number of countries that compete in the world coal markets 
worldwide  we believe thermal coal stockpiles generally are at multi year lows  especially in major coal consuming nations such as china and india 
we believe that although utility coal stockpile levels in the us are at levels above historical norms  some eastern utilities are struggling with extremely low levels of supply 
the result has been an increasing number of requests for spot shipments 
as of december   we had committed of planned thermal coal production for while leaving approximately of planned production uncommitted for and for we are in active discussions with a number of us utilities for supply in and beyond 
with steel prices rising at the end of  and the domestic steel industry expecting a strong rebound this year after a dramatic draw down of service center inventories  demand for metallurgical coal has remained very strong 
supply meanwhile has been constrained by flooding in the world s most productive metallurgical coal producing region in australia and by logistics constraints there  as well as production difficulties experienced by other significant north american producers 
at the end of  we had approximately one million tons of planned metallurgical production remaining to be contracted for  mostly in the export market 
uncommittted and unpriced production for stands at approximately million tons and million tons for metallurgical sales are expected to account for percent of expected sales volumes  similar to due to the fact that pricing resets at the end of the first quarter of every year for the majority of our contracted metallurgical business  the company expects to achieve a proportionally higher level of revenues in the second through fourth quarters than in the first quarter as the higher priced export contracts phase in 
while our outlook on coal pricing remains positive  future coal prices are subject to factors beyond our control and we cannot predict whether and for how long this current coal pricing environment will continue 
as of december   of our planned production was committed and priced and less than was committed and unpriced  with approximately million tons uncommitted 
committed steam coal prices for average per ton and met coal prices average per ton 
approximately of our planned production in is committed 
at december   we had unrealized gains losses on open purchase and sale contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these assets and liabilities are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities  respectively  on our balance sheet  with periodic changes in fair value recorded to the income statement 
since the company intends to take delivery or provide delivery of coal under these contracts  the unrealized gains and losses recorded as of december  will reverse into the income statement in future periods 
the reversal of unrealized gains related to purchase coal contracts will result in higher costs of sales in future periods when we ultimately take delivery of the coal under these contracts and sell it to our customers 
the reversal of the unrealized losses related to sales contracts will result in higher coal revenues in future periods when we satisfy our commitments under these contracts 
due to market price fluctuations  we could experience significant earnings volatility related to coal contracts classified as derivatives

coal revenues decreased for the year ended december  by million or  to  million  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a per ton decrease in the average sales price of our coal and a decrease of million tons sold over the comparable period last year 
tons sold decreased from million tons in to million tons in mainly due to a decrease in steam tons sold 
the mark to market adjustments for certain forward sales contracts which are considered derivatives under sfas and are recorded at fair value decreased revenues by million  or per ton 
we have unrealized losses of million recorded as of december  on our statement of financial position related to forward contracts for the sale of coal on the otc market which are considered derivatives under sfas since we intend to satisfy our commitments under these derivative contracts by providing delivery of the coal that is the subject of the derivative  the unrealized losses recorded as of december  will reverse into the income statement in future periods resulting in higher coal revenues in those future periods

our cost of coal sales increased as a result of increased prices for labor  diesel fuel and other mine supplies  and the performance and cost of contract mining services 
in addition  our costs were impacted due to lower productivity in when compared to mainly due to an increase in our average surface mine overburden ratio and a decrease in clean tons per foot in our deep mines 
the average cost per ton sold increased from per ton in to per ton in our cost of coal sales as a percentage of coal revenues increased from in to in for the years ended december  and our average cost per ton for our produced and processed coal sales was and  respectively 
our average cost per ton for coal that we purchased from third parties and resold without processing was and  respectively

these were partially offset by a decrease in maxxim rebuild s outside sales activity of million and a million decrease in costs associated with our road construction operations 
this decrease in cost for road construction is due to the completion of a portion of the king coal highway in west virginia  partially offset by increased activity for ongoing construction projects

since our formation and through the third quarter of  for purposes of evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  we did not weigh significantly our forecast of future taxable income subjective evidence as we had not yet established an adequate earnings history defined by us as at least three years to provide objective evidence of the ability to generate future income 
accordingly  we had recorded a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a three year history of cumulative earnings 
as a result  we believe we were able to place a higher degree of reliance on our projections of future taxable income 
based on the results of a comprehensive analysis completed in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset previously reserved through a valuation allowance will be realized 
as a result  we recorded a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million

credit facility and long term debt as of december   our total long term indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  consisted of the following in thousands december  term loan senior notes due gallatin loan facility capital lease obligation other total long term debt less current portion long term debt  net of current portion the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes each impose certain restrictions on anr llc and its restricted subsidiaries  including  subject to certain exceptions  restrictions on their ability to incur debt  grant liens  enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  pay dividends and make other distributions  make loans  investments  advances and acquisitions  sell assets  pay dividends or make distributions  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  liquidate or dissolve  engage in mergers or consolidations  engage in affiliate transactions  change businesses  change our fiscal year  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
the credit facility also requires us to satisfy two financial performance covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
in addition  alpha natural resources  inc is a guarantor of anr llc s obligations under the credit facility and the senior notes 
the credit facility prohibits alpha natural resources  inc from engaging in any business or activities other than the following holding the equity interests of anr llc  paying taxes  preparing reports to governmental authorities and shareholders  holding director and shareholder meetings  preparing corporate records and engaging in activities required to maintain its corporate existence  fulfilling obligations under acquisition and disposition agreements  and guaranteeing certain obligations of its subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to mandatory prepayment with of the net cash proceeds received from asset sales or other dispositions of property by the company and its subsidiaries including insurance and other condemnation proceedings  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment provisions  and with of the net cash proceeds received by the company and its subsidiaries from the issuance of debt securities or other incurrence of debt  excluding certain indebtedness 
at december   anr llc had net assets of million and  except for allowable distributions for the payment of income taxes  administrative expenses and  in certain circumstances  dividends or repurchases of common stock of the company  the net assets of anr llc are restricted 
all of our borrowings under the credit facility are at a variable rate  so we are exposed to the effect of rising interest rates 
as of december   we had a million term loan outstanding with a variable interest rate based upon the month london interbank offered rate libor at december  plus the applicable margin  at december  
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may   we entered into a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap on the notional amount of million for a period of approximately six and one half years 
in effect  this swap converted the variable interest rates based on libor to a fixed interest rate of plus the applicable margin defined in the debt agreement for the remainder of our term loan 
we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value of the swap are recorded to other comprehensive income loss 
the critical terms of the swap and the underlying debt instrument that it hedges perfectly match  resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in the income statement during the years ended december  and the fair value of the swap at december  and were million and million  respectively  which was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the offsetting unrealized loss of million and million  respectively  net of tax benefit  were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the derivative hedging instrument are reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation of plus the applicable margin 
gallatin entered into a non recourse senior secured loan facility with nedbank limited on december  the gallatin loan facility to provide phase one project financing for the construction of assets in the amount of  which includes a  senior term loan facility and a  senior standby term loan facility at an interest rate based upon the month london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of at december  the final maturity date is july  we are in compliance with all covenants under the gallatin loan facility 
the financial covenants require that we maintain the following loan life coverage ratio greater than or equal to  defined as the ratio of the present value of future cash flow to aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans  gearing ratio less than  defined as the ratio of outstanding net interest bearing indebtedness to total borrower equity  and debt service cover ratio greater than  defined as the ratio of actual cash flow available for debt service to funded debt service 
as of december   our financial covenants are and for the loan life coverage ratio and the gearing ratio  respectively 
phase one was not complete  therefore  the debt service cover ratio was not required 
in addition  as of december  gallatin had borrowed  under this loan facility 

table of contents other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies and related businesses  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies and related businesses 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
analysis of material debt covenants we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes as of december  the financial covenants in the credit facility require  among other things  that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to ebitda as defined in the credit facility adjusted ebitda  of not more than for the three fiscal quarter periods ending on june  september and december   and for the four fiscal quarter periods ending on march  and each quarter end thereafter  and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense  of at least for the four fiscal quarter periods ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter 
based upon adjusted ebitda  our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as such ratios are defined in the credit facility at december  were and  respectively 
a breach of the covenants in the credit facility that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under the credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any acceleration under our credit facility would also result in a default under the indenture for the senior notes 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda  further adjusted to exclude non recurring items  non cash items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit facility  as shown in the table below 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financial covenants 
three months ended march  three months ended june  three months ended september  three months ended december  twelve months ended december  in thousands net income interest expense  net income tax expense depreciation  depletion  and amortization ebitda unrestricted subsidiary fair value of derivative instruments other allowable adjustments accretion expense amortization of deferred gains stock based compensation charges adjusted ebitda leverage ratio interest coverage ratio leverage ratio is defined in our credit facility as total debt divided by adjusted ebitda 
interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit facility as adjusted ebitda divided by cash interest expense 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total long term debt and capital leases equipment purchase commitments operating leases minimum royalties coal purchase commitments gallatin commitments gallatin commitment other coal contract buyout total gallatin commitments and long term debt and capital leases include principal amounts due in the years shown 
interest payable on these obligations  with interest rates ranging between and on our loans and capital leases  would be approximately million in  million in to  million in to  and million after additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  workers compensation and black lung benefits and postretirement benefits 
the table below reflects the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these obligations in thousands within year years years after years total asset retirement obligation postretirement workers compensation benefits and black lung benefits total off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time  we provide guarantees to financial institutions to facilitate the acquisition of mining equipment by third parties who mine coal for us 
this arrangement is beneficial to us because it helps insure a continuing source of coal production 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive for us than the alternative of posting a cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
we then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with cash 
in recent years  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we have a committed bonding facility with travelers casualty and surety company of america  pursuant to which travelers has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
we also have a committed bonding facility with the chubb group of insurance companies  pursuant to which chubb has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
in  we added a third facility with safeco insurance company of america pursuant to which they have agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
as of december   we have posted an aggregate of million in reclamation bonds and million of other types of bonds under these facilities and maintained letters of credit totaling million to secure reclamation and other surety bond obligations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at deep mines 
we account for the costs of our reclamation activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
sfas requires the measurement of an obligation to be based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately million 
coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
at december   we had million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefit costs 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  at december   we had postretirement medical benefit obligations of million 
health care cost trend rate dollars in thousands one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation discount rate dollars in thousands one half percentage point increase one half percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
table of contents workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and an insurance policy 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
at december   we had workers compensation obligations of million 
coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
these claims are covered by a third party insurance provider in all locations where we operate with the exception of west virginia 
the company is self insured for state black lung related claims at certain locations in west virginia 
we account for self insured black lung obligations under the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefit other than pension  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
charges are made to operations for state black lung claims in west virginia  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
as of december   we had black lung obligations of million 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence as required by sfas such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to carry back and utilize a future tax loss if a loss were to occur  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
as further described in note  we reported three consecutive years of positive earnings history in the fourth quarter of this objective evidence  coupled with a review of the aforementioned areas in the fourth quarter  resulted in our recording of a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million less a valuation allowance of million

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  however management is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific  but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability 
sfas upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   however earlier application is permitted provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year 
the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  however management is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas discussion of seasonality impacts on operations our business is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we have historically experienced lower sales during winter months primarily due to the freezing of lakes that we use to transport coal to some of our customers 
as a result  our first quarter may be negatively impacted 
lower than expected sales by us during this period could have an adverse affect on the timing of our cash flows and therefore our ability to service our obligations with respect to our existing and future indebtedness 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to market risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing coal and diesel fuel prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling coal 
as of december   approximately and  respectively  of our planned production for and was uncommitted 
as compared to prior years  we have increased the proportion of our planned future production in and for which we have contracts to sell coal  which has the effect of reducing our market price risk 
we use significant quantities of diesel fuel in our operations and are also exposed to risk in the market price for diesel fuel 
we have entered into swap agreements and diesel put options to reduce the volatility in the price of diesel fuel for our operations 
the diesel fuel swap agreements and put options are not designated as hedges and therefore the changes in the fair value for these derivative instrument contracts are required to be recorded in cost of sales 
these diesel fuel swaps and put options use the nymex new york harbor heating oil as the underlying commodity reference price 
as of december  approximately million gallons or of the company s anticipated diesel fuel usage has been capped with the swap agreements in which the company has agreed to pay a fixed price and receive a floating price per gallon of diesel fuel 
the fixed prices for the notional quantity of million gallons range from to per gallon for the last eleven months of the fair value of these diesel fuel swap agreements are an asset of less than million as of december  as of december   the company entered into diesel fuel put options for million gallons at a price range of to per gallon for the last eleven months of in the event that diesel prices decline below the strike price  the company can exercise the put options and sell the million gallons at the strike price  therefore reducing the impact of the swap agreements 
these put options provide downside protection and reduce the fixed position risk of the outstanding diesel fuel swap agreements in the event of a decline in diesel fuel prices below the strike price 
the fair value of these diesel fuel put options are an asset of million as of december  we purchase coal in the otc market and directly from third parties to supplement and blend with our produced and processed coal in order to provide coal of the quality and quantity to meet certain of our customer s requirements 
we also sell in the otc market to fix the price of uncommitted future production from our mines 
certain of these purchase and sale contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument 
any derivative instruments that we hold are held for purposes other than trading 
our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purpose 
the use of purchase and sales contracts which are considered derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations as a result of the requirement to mark them to market at the end of each reporting period 
these transactions give rise to commodity price risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the price of coal 
outstanding purchase and sales contracts at december  that are considered derivative instruments are summarized as follows purchase contracts purchase price range tons outstanding delivery period mark to market adjustment in millions sales contracts selling price range tons outstanding delivery period mark to market adjustment in millions interest rate risk all of our borrowings under our credit facility and the gallatin loan facility are at a variable rate  exposing us to the effect of rising interest rates in the united states 
as of december   our credit facility had a million term loan outstanding with a variable interest rate based upon the month london interbank offered rate libor at december  plus an applicable margin at december  
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may  we entered into a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap on the notional amount of million for a period of approximately six and one half years 
in effect  this swap converted the variable interest rates based on the libor to a fixed interest rate of plus the applicable margin defined in the debt agreement at december  for the remainder of our term loan 
we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in fair value of the swap are recorded to other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of the swap at year end december  was a liability of million million net of tax 
as of december   gallatin had outstanding borrowings under the gallatin loan facility of million at an interest rate based upon the month libor at december  plus an applicable margin of 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase in interest expense of approximately million based on our variable rate borrowings as of december
