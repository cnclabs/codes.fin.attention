business model we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year our total revenues for fiscal year were million  which were higher than our prior fiscal year revenues of million 
license revenues increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year we also experienced continued growth in our services revenues  which increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the growth in services revenue was driven by a growth in maintenance and support  while consulting revenues decreased by approximately as compared to fiscal year international software sales were another key driver behind our positive growth in fiscal year which increased by over fiscal year this increase was primarily concentrated in europe 
our operating margin increased from million or of total revenues in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues in fiscal year net margin increased from million or of total 
table of contents revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues in fiscal year these increases in our operating and net margins were primarily due to increases in revenues described above 
fiscal year a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions in late fiscal have adversely impacted the financial services industry 
if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently anticipate that our total revenues in fiscal year will remain relatively consistent with those levels experienced in fiscal year while fiscal year license revenues may decrease by as much as from fiscal year levels 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to have significant impact on results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly if at all in the fiscal year particularly among financial services companies in the untied states 
second  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  ria and performance management software purchases into fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the ria market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our ria offerings 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the ria market will be vigorous in the near future 
for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth that we began introducing in fiscal year as well as an initiative related to performance management  which we introduced in fiscal these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating performance management applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management and customer self service reporting 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source business intelligence and reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we are continuing to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate negative impact of the ongoing credit crunch on the financial services sector in however  we believe that once the short term issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of ria both inside and outside the firewall 
delivering a highly differentiated performance management offering we intend to combine actuate performancesoft performance management applications and actuate s ria ready information platform to provide capabilities for distributing accountability throughout the enterprise 
recent us sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets  causing global credit and liquidity issues 
the short term funding markets experienced credit issues during the first quarter of fiscal this led to liquidity disruption in asset backed commercial paper 
table of contents and failed auctions in the auction rate market 
if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities  which are investments with contractual maturities 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are subject to reset through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by highly rated municipal issuers 
as of december   we had million invested in auction rate securities 
these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to december  as of march   all of our auction rate securities have failed auctions 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is often obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as of march   we had million invested in auction rate securities 
we determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of december  as all holdings had successful auctions subsequent to december  however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   our workforce remained at approximately the same level as the prior year at full time employees including in sales and marketing  in research and development  in services and support  and in general and administrative functions 
during the first half of fiscal year  we evaluated the consolidation of our facilities as a result of the performancesoft acquisition and determined that a  facility related restructuring charge was required 
this charge was directly related to the consolidation of our three offices located in united kingdom into one office and was accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
during the second half of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge related to the relocation of our headquarters facility from south san francisco to san mateo  california and the closure of our service facility in iselin  new jersey 
these charges were primarily comprised of rent and operating expenses through the end of the lease term for the south san francisco facility  disposal of fixed assets and leasehold improvements considered abandoned  and relocation costs to the new facility 
we also recorded restructuring charges for rent and operating expenses for the iselin  new jersey facility 
as a result of this relocation and the closure of our services facility  we recorded a total restructuring charge of million in the second half of fiscal year in accordance with sfas we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents acquisitions on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of performancesoft  inc the acquisition principally consisted of an initial cash purchase price of million and additional contingent cash consideration of up to million based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating margin targets for fiscal year due to the fact that the contingent consideration was not determinable at the time of acquisition  the company did not include this contingent consideration in the acquisition cost at that time 
rather  it was recorded in the fourth quarter of  when the company was able to determine the estimated amount of the payout 
the company determined that the initial earnout payment would be approximately million and the company recorded this estimated cost as additional cost of the acquired enterprise and this additional consideration was allocated to goodwill at that time 
this amount was increased by an additional  in the third quarter of fiscal year when the final settlement agreement was signed 
this agreement represented the final earnout settlement amount along with accrued interest 
the company recorded this additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired enterprise and this additional consideration was allocated to goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal year the total amount of the contingent consideration was paid out to the former shareholders in october in accordance with criteria stipulated in the acquisition agreement  funds previously held in escrow totaling  were released to actuate in october the company had previously included these funds held in escrow as part of the initial purchase price  and accordingly  it recorded this release of funds from escrow of  as a reduction in the cost of the acquired enterprise and this was offset to goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
actuate recognizes revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for sales to end user customers  actuate recognizes license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties or a definitive agreement has been received from the customer  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
actuate has not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for its licenses 
therefore  the company 
table of contents recognizes revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method 
if the license agreement contains payment terms that would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
actuate enters into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically give such distributors and resellers the right to distribute its products to end users headquartered in specified territories 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with us resellers and distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the reseller or distributor  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with international resellers and distributors upon receipt of evidence of sell through and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if it is not practical to obtain evidence of sell through  the company defers revenues until the end user has been identified and cash has been received 
in some instances there is a timing difference between when a reseller completes its sale to the end user and the period in which actuate receives the documentation required for revenue recognition 
because actuate delays revenue recognition until the reporting period in which the required documentation is obtained  it may recognize revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the reseller completes the sale to its end user 
actuate also enters into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on the bundling or embedding of its products with the oem s products 
these arrangements generally provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
actuate recognizes license fee revenues from us and international oem arrangements when a license agreement has been executed by both parties  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
effective july   due to improved visibility with respect to international oem sales transactions  we conformed our policy for sales through international oems to be consistent with us oem arrangements 
prior to this change  we deferred revenue on sales through international oems until we received a royalty report or other evidence of sell through from such oem  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria was met 
the impact of this change on revenue for fiscal year was not significant 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are assessed based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
actuate recognizes maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to standard implementation and configuration 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at the company s headquarters and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are typically recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is typically recognized on delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the product and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 

table of contents we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of sfas r for a all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
fas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future 
our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our method of deriving the expected term 
this change could impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
sfas no 
requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
as a result of the cumulative losses we incurred in prior years  we previously concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing in fiscal year  we determined that our recent experience of generating income  along with our projections of future us and foreign income  constituted significant positive evidence for a partial release of our valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets 
in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit related to a release of the valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the future as identified by two year projections 
in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit related to a release of the valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets expected to be realized within the next five years 
at future dates  if sufficient positive evidence exists that it is more likely than 
table of contents not that the benefit will be realized with respect to the remaining deferred tax assets  we will release additional valuation allowance 
this adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease tax expense  reduce goodwill or intangibles and or increase shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  if there is a reduction in the projection of future us and foreign income  we may need to increase the valuation allowance 
any increase in the valuation allowance would increase tax expense  increase goodwill or intangibles or decrease shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  fin prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  only income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements 
an income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin and sfas no 
the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations 
however  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be predicted with certainty 
in addition  we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination  we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 
contingencies 
we are or have been engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in litigation or settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal years ended december   and we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with our restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
in process research and development 
we review our acquisitions to determine if there are any intangible assets relating to purchased in process research and development 
projects that have not achieved technological feasibility and have no alternative future use are valued at fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis and are expensed in the statement of income on the date of acquisition 
we use a discount rate that reflects the development stage of the technology and the risks associated with attaining full technological and commercial feasibility 
when we value in process research and development  we must make a number of estimates  including the timing and amounts of future cash flows to be generated as a result of the projects  how close the projects are to technological feasibility and how much risk and cost is involved in finalizing the projects 
it is reasonably likely that our estimates for these amounts will differ from actual results  in which case our in process research and development charge may be over or under valued  which would also result in an under or over valuation of our goodwill 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce  and trademarks 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
as of december  the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the non expiring option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan to the company and actuate has the option to call the minority interest 
in february  a minority shareholder of actuate japan notified the company that it wished to exercise its rights to put its equity interest in actuate japan 
this minority shareholder exercised its right on march  resulting in a payment of approximately  for this interest during the first quarter of fiscal year this payment was recorded as additional goodwill related to actuate japan 
the minority interest as of december  was approximately of the total equity interest 
if the minority interest shareholder chose to put these remaining shares  actuate would be required to pay approximately  to purchase these shares 
the company s policy is to record a liability  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  the company would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
the company performs a periodic review of the value of the minority interest 
this review may include assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the company s conclusion as to whether it is necessary to record a liability 
as of december   the company concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability 
the company consolidated of the operating results and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
as of the date of this filing  the remaining minority shareholder has not notified the company of any intent to exercise its put option 
recovery of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets periodically by analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
at some point in the future  we may determine that our long lived assets are impaired 
the timing of such impairment may result in charges to our consolidated statement of income to reduce the value of the asset carried on our consolidated balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge based on various assumptions and estimates 
assumptions and estimates about future values can be complex and are often subjective 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results

the increase in total revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased demand and a wider acceptance of our products by global customers companies with annual revenues greater than billion 
this wider acceptance resulted in an increase in the number of large dollar value license deals deals in excess of million over fiscal year increase in our maintenance and support revenues 
approximately of this increase related to a transaction with a customer who was out of compliance with its maintenance agreement and accordingly paid back maintenance 
growth in international license sales 
the expansion of our birt initiative and application of our business intelligence  performance management and reporting products and services resulted in the expansion of our products across more diverse industry groups in fiscal including retail  government  technology and health care 

table of contents the increase in total revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to acquisition of performancesoft  inc in january  which accounted for approximately million  or of the increase 
increase in new and repeat business from a number of global customers companies with annual revenues greater than billion and further expansion of our product and services into financial and government sectors  increase in the worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing support 
due primarily to the current economic conditions  especially as they impact the financial services sector  we anticipate that fiscal year total revenues will remain relatively consistent with those experienced in fiscal year license fees year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the increase in license revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to improved sales across both international and domestic regions 
international license revenues increased by or approximately million and this growth was primarily seen in our european region 
north american license revenues increased by or approximately million over fiscal year in addition  we experienced an increase in the average size of license transactions and the number of license transactions in excess of million over the same period last fiscal year 
we also experienced broader acceptance of the company s birt initiative and application of our business intelligence  performance management and reporting products by our existing and new global customers 
the increase in license revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to our acquisition of performancesoft  which added approximately million to license revenue in fiscal year additionally  during fiscal year  we received an increased number of individual product license transactions in excess of million compared to fiscal year also  in fiscal year we recognized million in license revenue resulting from the conclusion of a license royalty compliance issue that included license revenues pending since fiscal year no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the periods presented 
the following table represents the changes in license revenue by region dollars in thousands year ended december  to to software license change change change change north america europe apac total license revenue percentage of total revenue the european region realized the most significant license revenue growth in fiscal year approximately million of this growth was due to the strength of the euro and the british pound against the 
table of contents us dollar 
as a percentage of total revenues  license fee revenues increased from in the fiscal year to in fiscal year the regions that realized the most significant license revenue growth in fiscal year were the north american and the european regions 
these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of performancesoft 
as a percentage of total revenues  license fee revenues increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due to current economic conditions  especially as they affect the financial services sector  we currently anticipate that our license revenues in fiscal year could decrease by as much as from fiscal year levels 
consequently  we expect our license revenues to range between million and million for fiscal year maintenance and services revenue dollars in thousands year ended december  to to change change change change maintenance consulting total services revenue percentage of total revenue maintenance and services revenue is comprised of maintenance and support  professional services  and training 
the growth in services revenues for fiscal year was primarily attributed to the increase in our maintenance and support revenues driven by a continued growth in our installed base of customers under maintenance plans 
the increase in the installed base was evidenced by the fact that we were now supporting a large percentage of the million in new licenses sold in fiscal year  while our maintenance declination rate has remained consistent 
in addition  we concluded a transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year with one of our customers who was out of compliance on their maintenance agreements 
this arrangement brought the customer current on their maintenance and included approximately million of revenue related to maintenance periods preceding fiscal year  but was recognized in fiscal year the amount related to the prior year was less than of total revenue 
the increase in maintenance revenue was offset by a decrease in professional services revenues 
this decrease was primarily the result of the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
the success of the company s birt initiative therefore resulted in a reduction in the company s revenue from professional services during the year 
the growth in maintenance and services revenues for fiscal year was primarily attributed to the increase in our maintenance and support revenues of approximately or million  driven by a continued growth in our installed base of customers under maintenance plans and our continued implementation of an aggressive renewal campaign by our maintenance renewal group 
the increase in the installed base was evidenced by the fact that we were supporting a large percentage of the million in new licenses sold in fiscal year  while our maintenance declination rate had remained consistent 
of the total increase in maintenance and support revenues  million was attributed to our acquisition of performancesoft in january consulting services revenues also increased by or million during fiscal year this increase was almost entirely due to the acquisition of performancesoft 
we currently expect our maintenance and services revenues to range between million and million for fiscal year 
table of contents costs and expenses cost of license fees year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of license revenue cost of license fees consists primarily of salaries  production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  third party royalty fees and localization costs 
the decrease in cost of license fees for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to reduced printing and production related costs  partially offset by an increase in employee compensation due to added headcount and increased stock compensation charges 
the decrease in cost of license fees for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to reduced compensation  printing and production related costs as well as a decrease in the amortization of the purchased technologies associated with the acquisition of tidestone and nimble  which had been fully amortized in fiscal year cost of license fees further decreased due to the fact that we are no longer obligated to pay royalties to one of our main vendors as we acquired the rights to the underlying technology outright in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these decreases more than offset the increase in the amortization of acquired rights to the purchased intangibles derived from the performancesoft acquisition

the decrease in cost of services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a reduction in headcount from employees at the end of fiscal year to employees at the end of fiscal year in addition  we also made a shift in company practice to reduce the use of outside third party consultants  thereby reducing costs 
third party revenue decreased by from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year also  there was lower demand for our professional services during as compared to last year primarily due to the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products

sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase of million in compensation  travel and other employee related expenses 
this increase was primarily the result of a increase to our sales and marketing related headcount  which was driven mainly by the acquisition of performancesoft

none of these annual impairment tests resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
for the years ended december  and december   we recorded  for the amortization of other purchased intangibles 
these costs represent the amortization of the intangibles associated with the acquisition of performancesoft on a straight line basis 
the increase in the amortization of other intangibles in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our acquisition of performancesoft in january of fiscal year  offset by full amortization of other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of tidestone and nimble technology 
we expect the estimated amortization expense of our existing other purchased intangible assets in fiscal year to remain consistent with the levels experienced in fiscal year purchased in process research and development during fiscal year in connection with the acquisition of performancesoft  we recorded a charge to operations of  for purchased in process research and development 
this charge was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year and was expensed because the research and development had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses

there were no significant restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year 
table of contents during the first half of fiscal year  we evaluated the consolidation of our facilities as a result of the performancesoft acquisition and determined that a  facility related restructuring charge was required 
this charge was directly related to the consolidation of our three offices located in the united kingdom into one office and was accounted for in accordance with fas during the second half of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge related to the relocation of our headquarters facility from south san francisco to san mateo  california and the closure of our service facility in iselin  new jersey 
these charges were primarily comprised of rent and operating expenses through the end of the lease term for the fully vacated portion of the south san francisco facility  impairment of fixed assets and leasehold improvements considered abandoned  and relocation costs to the new facility 
we also recorded restructuring charges for rent and operating expenses for the iselin  new jersey facility

investment in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the non expiring option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan and actuate has the option to call the minority interest

this minority shareholder exercised its right on march  resulting in a payment of approximately  for this interest during the first quarter of fiscal year this payment was recorded as additional goodwill related to actuate japan 
the minority interest as of december  was approximately of the total equity interest 
if the minority interest shareholder chose to put these remaining shares  actuate would be required to pay approximately  to purchase these shares 
the company s policy is to record a liability  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  the company would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
the company performs a periodic review of the value of the minority interest 
this review may include assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the company s conclusion as to whether it is necessary to record a liability 
as of december   the company concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability 
the company consolidated of the operating results and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
as of the date of this filing  the remaining minority shareholder has not notified the company of any intent to exercise its put option

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our primary market risk exposure has historically been a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
recently the financial markets have experienced global credit and liquidity issues 
the short term funding markets experienced credit issues during the first quarter of fiscal this led to liquidity disruption in asset backed commercial paper and failed auctions in the auction rate market 
if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities  which are investments with contractual maturities 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are subject to reset through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by highly rated municipal issuers 
as of december   we had million invested in auction rate securities 
these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to december  as of march   all of our auction rate securities have failed auctions 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is often obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as of march   we had million invested in auction rate securities 
we determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of december  as all holdings had successful auctions subsequent to december  however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during the fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately  in fiscal year compared to gains of approximately  during fiscal year and losses of approximately  in fiscal year interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates the majority of our portfolio is invested in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
we 
table of contents have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
