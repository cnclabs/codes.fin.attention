item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fiscal for patrick industries the company could be characterized from management s perspective as a time of transformation for the company 
in january  we completed the acquisition of american hardwoods  inc american hardwoods  an industrial distribution company located in phoenix  arizona  representing our first acquisition since in may  we completed the largest acquisition in our history by acquiring adorn holdings  inc  adorn a well known manufacturer and supplier to the manufactured housing  recreational vehicle  and industrial markets 
the purchase price for american hardwoods was million and the purchase price for adorn was approximately million 
the american hardwoods acquisition allowed us to increase our industrial penetration through a new distribution channel and represents a potential model for future industrial expansion 
the adorn acquisition presents numerous synergistic opportunities  including facility rationalization  headcount reduction  increased capacity utilization  increased purchasing leverage and presence  and the combination of two strong management teams working together to facilitate best practices among industry leaders 
further  the adorn acquisition allowed us to virtually double our manufacturing revenues and significantly increase our market share in the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries 
both acquisitions fit within the framework of our strategic plan as it relates to strong historical financial performance  solid management teams  positive profit analysis and projections  and competitive pricing multiples  among others 
as a result of the adorn acquisition  much of our focus from may through december was on the execution of the consolidation plan and transition of adorn into patrick at all levels  from the closing and consolidation of seven manufacturing plants and two operating cells  to the administrative and corporate functions necessary to drive the business 
additionally  we continue to analyze the benefits of relocating certain divisions in order to capitalize on floor space  rail siding  and cost 
the goal to have the majority of the transition completed by december  was met on time and according to plan 
from a demographic and logistics perspective  adorn in its original form  operated out of ten business units located in eight different states 
the patrick platform was comprised of twenty seven different business units including distribution located in twelve different states 
together  the combined company facilities overlapped in six of the eight states in which adorn was located 
specifically as a result of the adorn acquisition through december   we have closed and consolidated five adorn operations into patrick facilities  four of which were leased  closed operations at the company s unprofitable hardwood cabinet door division in oregon and transferred that business to adorn s state of the art cabinet door operation in elkhart  indiana  closed and consolidated our moulding division in california  closed two unprofitable manufacturing lines in elkhart  reduced overall hourly and salaried headcount by approximately people  and reallocated business to more logistically superior locations to improve efficiencies 
from a fixed cost perspective from january  through december   we eliminated approximately salaried administrative and production positions representing approximately million in fixed costs including benefits 
additionally  in march  we eliminated another administrative and production positions representing approximately million in annualized fixed and variable costs including benefits 
in the second quarter of  we were able to capitalize on combined purchasing initiatives to facilitate certain inventory  cash flow  and pricing opportunities including vendor managed inventory programs and margin enhancement  resulting in increased cash flow and the pay down of approximately million in senior term debt 
since the may  acquisition date  we have reduced our senior term loan by approximately million and reduced total debt under the facility by approximately million 
management s debt reduction focus has resulted in overall debt reduction under the facility of approximately million over and above its normal debt service requirements 
additionally  we have been able to capitalize on certain supply chain management programs resulting in approximately million in improved gross margin dollars from these initiatives 
the million acquisition price  including costs  paid for adorn was funded through both debt and equity financing 
the debt financing was provided in the form of a million credit facility comprised of a million term loan and a million revolver 
the credit facility the facility was provided by an eight bank syndication led by jpmorgan securities  inc and jpmorgan chase bank  na the facility is structured to provide additional liquidity to facilitate the combined companies future growth plans and working capital needs 
additional financing for the acquisition was provided by tontine capital partners  lp and tontine capital overseas master fund  lp collectively tontine 
tontine  a significant shareholder of patrick  purchased  shares of patrick common stock in a private placement at a purchase price of  or approximately million in the aggregate 
tontine also provided interim debt financing in the form of senior subordinated notes totaling approximately million 
the adorn opening balance sheet added approximately million in current assets  million in net property and equipment  million in goodwill  and approximately million in identifiable intangible assets 
from a liability perspective  the company recorded approximately million in current liabilities and million in deferred income taxes 
from a general business perspective  the current downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations as the three primary industries in which we operate are experiencing overall declines and expected to continue through the manufactured housing industry continues to be negatively impacted by financing concerns and a lack of available financing sources  and the current credit situation in the residential housing market puts additional pressure on consumers  who are generally using financial institutions as a source for these purchases 
recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases and therefore any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income has a negative impact on these markets 
approximately of our industrial revenue base is associated with the residential housing market  and therefore there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
our operations for were negatively affected by unfavorable market conditions and overall softness in the major domestic markets that we serve 
the conditions in the residential housing market  which play a significant role in consumer confidence and discretionary spending as it relates to the products we sell  experienced significant declines from an extended period of prosperity due in part to weak credit standards in the subprime markets and excessive home prices resulting in an overall tightening of credit by the lenders  excess inventory levels of unsold homes in the marketplace resulting in less new construction  and a general skepticism by consumers resulting in less discretionary spending 
these conditions are expected to continue at least through  and potentially into  and are expected to continue to impact the major markets that we serve 
the manufactured housing industry  which represents approximately of our revenue base for  continued to experience shipment declines and finished the year with shipments at approximately  units  levels not seen since this industry continues to be plagued by financing concerns including lack of funding sources  marketing and perception issues  excess capacity in apartment units  and low interest rates on traditional site built housing mortgages  which directly compete with the manufactured housing loans generally carrying a financing risk based premium 
industry shipment expectations for are projected to decline from the shipment levels 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include permanent rebuilding in hurricane damaged areas  rising interest rates  quality credit standards  mild inflation and improved job growth 
today s current factory built modular homes represent an attractive cost effective alternative to traditional site built homes 
as certain housing manufacturers continue their penetration into the modular housing sector  the demand for our manufactured custom panels continues to shift to our distribution products which include  but are not limited to  the raw substrates and tape and texture products 
the recreational vehicle industry  which represents approximately of our combined annual sales  experienced shipment declines in all four quarters of  from the prior year  and a year over year decline of approximately to finish at approximately  units 
while this market experienced some softening  the year represented the sixth consecutive year of shipment levels above the  unit level and the first decline in the last four years 
demographic projections for the recreational vehicle industry remain positive from a long term perspective as the hassles of air travel  an aging baby boomer population with more disposable income  the relatively low cost of recreational vehicle vacations  successful product development and enhancement campaigns  and a successful marketing campaign all point to projected long term growth for the industry 
the industrial market sector has been negatively impacted by an approximate decline in the residential housing market 
approximately of our revenue base in these industries is tied to the residential housing market and includes kitchen cabinet and cabinet components  which relate to not only new home construction  but remodeling and upgrades as well 
this market sector is expected to remain depressed for most of  with improvement not anticipated until while we have completed the majority of synergistic facility rationalization initiatives to improve operating efficiencies in our plants through increased capacity utilization  these soft market conditions have had  and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on our operations in for the year ended december   we reported net sales of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million  or per diluted share  compared with net sales of million  and net earnings of million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
the year over year increase in sales was from the adorn and american hardwoods acquisitions and new product introductions  partially offset by the softness in our core markets

inventory and receivable levels increased slightly from the prior year due primarily to normal cyclical operating cycles and to the acquisition of adorn and american hardwoods in the first six months of at the acquisition date  these two acquisitions contributed an incremental million to inventory and approximately million to accounts receivable 
we entered into a vendor managed inventory agreement with one of our suppliers in the second quarter resulting in approximately million of operating cash flow and reduction of the overall inventory balance as it relates to a certain commodity 
the proceeds from this agreement were used to reduce the senior term loan 
from an overall debt perspective  since the acquisition of adorn on may  through december   we have paid down approximately million in additional revolving and term debt  over and above normal debt service requirements 
prices for certain of our major commodity products continue to face pricing pressures as a result of the soft industry conditions and excess capacity 
the majority of price increases over the past months began in the first quarter of and on average continued through the third quarter of economic conditions in the primary industries then began to soften resulting in downward pricing pressure beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through we expect the soft market conditions and excess supply to result in pricing erosion in in certain of our major commodity product categories 
with the recent strategic acquisitions of american hardwoods and adorn  we believe that we continue to establish our platform for future growth and create shareholder value  and are positioned to increase revenues in all of the markets that we serve upon improvement in the overall economic environment 
while market conditions are expected to remain depressed for  key focus areas include capturing market share  implementation of lean principles in all manufacturing operations and our corporate office  maintaining a lean organizational structure  reducing and controlling costs  future acquisitions  and growing all areas of the business

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in the footnotes to our financial statements 
some of the most critical policies are also discussed below 
accounts receivable 
we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and other industrial markets 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its accounts receivable  the company estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on our historical write off experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts of and was established at december  and  respectively 
a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates in the past three years 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for inventory obsolescence of  and was established at december  and  respectively 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates in the past three years 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the manufactured housing or recreational vehicle industries  and or a loss of a major customer or several customers 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for the years ended december    and a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which may subsequently result in an impairment charge 
impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
we perform the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if conditions warrant 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the reporting units of the company are utilized  after considering the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as amended and the relevant provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  and related interpretive literature 
the impairment tests performed by the company are based on estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge 
seasonality manufacturing operations in the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate 
accordingly  our sales and profits are generally highest in the second and third quarters 
sale of property not applicable 
purchase of property not applicable 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in march and july  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
a portion of our debt obligations under our credit agreement are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on libor 
a basis point increase in the underlying rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average related term debt subject to variable rates of  which was the amount of related borrowings at december  subject to variable rates 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
we utilize a mix of investment maturities based on our anticipated cash needs and evaluation of existing interest rates and market conditions 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
