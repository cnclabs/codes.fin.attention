st 
gabriel mercury vapor emissions release our recently acquired subsidiary  pioneer  discovered in october that the carbon based system used to remove mercury from the hydrogen gas stream at the st 
gabriel facility was not at that time sufficiently effective  resulting in mercury vapor emissions that were above the permit limits approved by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq 
pioneer immediately reduced the plant s operating rate and  in late november  completed the installation of the necessary equipment and made the other needed changes  and the plant resumed its normal operations 
pioneer s emissions monitoring since that time confirmed that the air emissions are below the permit limits 
in january  the ldeq issued a violation notice to pioneer as a result of this mercury vapor emissions release 
in december  the ldeq issued a penalty assessment of million with respect to the notice of violation 
pioneer has administratively appealed the penalty assessment 
given the facts and circumstances  pioneer requested that the ldeq reconsider the penalty assessment 
other as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state  and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background the metals business has been classified as discontinued operations during and was excluded from the segment results for all periods presented 
as a result  our manufacturing operations are concentrated in two business segments chlor alkali products and winchester 
both are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with operating rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year discontinued operations in  the industry in which the metals business operates experienced a decline in volumes that created over capacity in the marketplace  which reduced our financial returns in the metals business 
volumes have not returned to pre levels 
over the past several years  we have undertaken a number of restructuring and downsizing actions  including multiple plant closures 
the benefits of these actions have been more than offset by the escalation of both energy and commodity metal prices  specifically copper  zinc  and nickel 
as a result  we have been unable to realize acceptable returns in the business 
during the second half of and first half of  we evaluated a number of strategic alternatives for the metals business  and we made the decision in mid to engage goldman  sachs co 
to conduct a formal strategic evaluation process  including the alternative of selling the business 
the sale of metals provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue investments in areas where we can earn the best returns 
on october   we announced we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the metals business to global for million  payable in cash 
the price received was subject to a customary working capital adjustment 
the sale was subject to hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act clearance  but not shareholder approval 
the transaction closed on november  based on the metals assets held for sale  we recognized a pretax loss of million partially offset by a million income tax benefit  resulting in a net loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million for the loss on disposal of discontinued operations includes a pension curtailment charge of million  other postretirement benefits curtailment credit of million and estimated transaction fees of million 
the final loss recognized related to this transaction will be dependent upon the final determination of the value of working capital in the business 
the loss on the disposal  which includes transaction costs  reflects a book value of the metals business of approximately million and a tax basis of approximately million 
the difference between the book and tax values of the business reflects primarily goodwill of million and intangibles of million 
based on an estimated working capital adjustment  we anticipate net cash proceeds from the transaction of million  which is in addition to the million of after tax cash flow realized from the operation of metals during the metals business was a reportable segment comprised of principal manufacturing facilities in east alton  il and montpelier  oh 
metals produced and distributed copper and copper alloy sheet  strip  foil  rod  welded tube  fabricated parts  and stainless steel and aluminum strip 
sales for the metals business were  million   million  and  million for the period of our ownership in   and  respectively 
the metals business sales included commodity metal price changes that are primarily a pass through 
intersegment sales of million  million and million for the period of our ownership in  and  respectively  representing the sale of ammunition cartridge case cups to winchester from metals  at prices that approximate market  have been eliminated from metals sales 
in conjunction with the sale of the metals business  winchester agreed to purchase the majority of its ammunition cartridge case cups and copper based strip requirements from global under a multi year agreement with pricing  terms  and conditions which approximate market 
the metals business employed approximately  hourly and salaried employees 
as the criteria to treat the related assets and liabilities as held for sale were met in the third quarter of  the related assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale  and the results of operations from the metals business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in conjunction with the sale of the metals business  we retained certain assets and liabilities including certain assets co located with our winchester business in east alton  il  assets and liabilities associated with former metals manufacturing locations  pension assets and pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance liabilities associated with metals employees for service earned through the date of sale  and certain environmental obligations existing at the date of closing associated with current and past metals manufacturing operations and waste disposal sites 
pioneer acquisition on august   we acquired pioneer  a manufacturer of chlorine  caustic soda  bleach  sodium chlorate  and hydrochloric acid 
pioneer owns and operates four chlor alkali plants and several bleach manufacturing facilities in north america 
under the merger agreement  each share of pioneer common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash  without interest 
the aggregate purchase price for all of pioneer s outstanding shares of common stock  together with the aggregate payment due to holders of options to purchase shares of common stock of pioneer  was million  which includes direct fees and expenses 
we financed the merger with cash and million of borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization facility accounts receivable facility 
we assumed million of pioneer s convertible debt which was redeemed in the fourth quarter of and january we paid a conversion premium of million on the pioneer convertible debt 
since august   pioneer sales were million and segment income was million  which were included in our chlor alkali products segment results 
as a result of acquiring pioneer  we anticipate realizing million of annual cost savings from integrating the pioneer operations and our operations within two years 
since august  chlor alkali products segment earnings included approximately million of realized synergies 
the ability to optimize freight costs will be a key synergy to be realized as part of the pioneer acquisition 
in  we have identified and implemented changes in ship to and ship from of both operations locations that we believe will reduce annual chlorine ton miles shipped by approximately 
the opportunity to rationalize selling and administration costs are also expected to be a significant cost savings realized as part of the pioneer acquisition 
selling and administration costs associated with pioneer operations were million in during the first quarter of  the pioneer corporate office in houston was closed  the space was subleased  and all of those activities have been consolidated into our existing functions and facilities 
financing in august  we entered into a million letter of credit facility to assume the various pioneer letters of credit issued principally to support the acquisition of materials for the st 
gabriel chlor alkali facility conversion and expansion project 
on october   we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility of million  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility will expire in october we have the option to expand the million senior revolving credit facility by million through adding a maximum of two additional lending institutions each year 
borrowing options and restrictive covenants are similar to those of our previous million senior revolving credit facility 
the million senior revolving credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility which is in addition to the million letter of credit facility 
on june   we entered into the million day revolving credit facility million credit facility and the million day revolving credit facility million credit facility 
according to their terms  the million credit facility matured on the earlier of june  or upon an increase in the lending commitments under our existing revolving credit facility and the establishment of an accounts receivable securitization facility  and the million credit facility would have matured on june  in the fourth quarter of  the million credit facility expired as all conditions for early termination were met and the million credit facility was terminated as we no longer needed the credit commitment 
on july   we established a million accounts receivable facility 
the accounts receivable facility provides for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to third party conduits through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial statement purposes 
the accounts receivable facility expires in july as a result of the sale of metals  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
we expect to include the pioneer accounts receivables during the first half of  which should increase the accounts receivable facility to approximately million 
the accounts receivable facility includes a letter of credit subfacility which is equal to of the amount of the facility  or currently million 
this subfacility is in addition to the million letter of credit facility and the million subfacility under the senior revolving credit facility 
year in april  we reached an agreement in principle and expected a settlement with the internal revenue service irs on certain outstanding federal tax exposures 
on july   the settlement was finalized 
this settlement  which includes the periods to  related primarily to the tax treatment of capital losses generated in we made payments of million and million in and  respectively  and expect to make payments of approximately million in to the irs and various state and local jurisdictions  which was less than the amount previously reserved 
as a result  income tax expense in was reduced by million associated with the settlement and other tax matters 
on june   we commenced an offer to exchange a new series of notes due in and cash for up to million of the million senior notes due in notes 
on july   we announced that approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes had been validly tendered for exchange 
since more than million of the notes had been tendered  the new notes were issued on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer 
on july   we issued million of senior notes due in notes and paid a premium of million to the existing note holders in exchange for million of notes 
we expensed million of third party fees associated with the exchange 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million insurance recovery for hurricane katrina business interruption experienced in our chlor alkali products operations in and early year during  we received a total of million from real estate dispositions  including interest of million 
the first disposition in march represented the settlement of a condemnation award relating to land associated with a former warehousing facility 
the other two transactions represented the disposition of land associated with former manufacturing plants 
during  we recovered environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods and related interest of million from third parties  which related primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations 
the first recovery in april was for million 
the second occurred in september and was for million 
the last occurred in november and was for million  which included million in interest 
during the third quarter of  both supply and demand in the chlor alkali industry were interrupted by three hurricanes  which caused customer outages and disruptions to the transportation system 
although none of our facilities were damaged  these factors reduced our operating rate during the third and fourth quarters of on december   we recorded an after tax charge of million million pretax in connection with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin no 
 an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

fin no 
clarified when sufficient information was available to estimate an asset retirement obligation 
in conjunction with this adoption  million was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
this charge was principally related to asset retirement obligations for production technology and building materials 
chlor alkali products pricing in accordance with industry practice  we compare ecu prices on a netback basis  reporting and analyzing prices net of the cost of transporting the products to customers to allow for a comparable means of price comparisons between periods and with respect to our competitors 
for purposes of determining our ecu netback  we use prices that we realize as a result of sales of chlorine and caustic soda to our customers  and we do not include the value of chlorine and caustic soda that is incorporated in other products that we manufacture and sell 
quarterly and annual average ecu netbacks  excluding sunbelt  for   and were as follows  which includes pioneer ecu netbacks subsequent to august  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter annual average changing demand for chlorine and caustic soda led to the price increases during the first half of in the third and fourth quarters of  increases were brought about by the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita which disrupted supply 
beginning in late  driven by reduced levels of chlorine demand and a series of planned and unplanned plant maintenance outages  chlor alkali plant operating rates were reduced 
while this allowed chlorine supply to stay balanced  it caused caustic soda demand to exceed supply 
this led to caustic soda price increases 
pension and postretirement benefits in october  we announced that we would freeze our defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargaining hourly employees 
affected employees were eligible to accrue pension benefits through december   but would not accrue any additional benefits under the plan after that date 
employee service after december  will count toward meeting the vesting requirements for such pension benefits and the eligibility requirements for commencing a pension benefit  but not toward the calculation of the pension benefit amount 
compensation earned after december  will similarly not count toward the determination of the pension benefit amounts under the defined benefit pension plan 
in lieu of continuing pension benefit accruals for the affected employees under the pension plan  starting in  we will provide a contribution to an individual retirement contribution account maintained with the contributing employee ownership plan ceop equal to of the employee s eligible compensation if such employee is less than age  and of the employee s eligible compensation if such employee is age or older 
freezing the defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargaining hourly employees was accounted for as a curtailment under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plan and for termination benefits sfas no 

as a result of freezing the defined benefit plan  we recorded a curtailment charge of million for the defined benefit pension plan and a corresponding curtailment credit of million for the non qualified pension plan 
during the third quarter of  the pension protection act of became law 
among the stated objectives of the law are the protection of both pension beneficiaries and the financial health of the pbgc 
to accomplish these objectives  the new law requires sponsors to fund defined benefit pension plans earlier than previous requirements and to pay increased pbgc premiums 
the law required defined benefit plans to be fully funded in in september  we made a voluntary pension plan contribution of million and in may  we made an additional million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
during  the asset allocation in the plan was adjusted to insulate the plan from discount rate risk and reduce the plan s exposure to equity investments 
based on the combination of these actions and favorable asset performance in and  it is likely that the defined benefit pension plan will meet the full funding requirements of the pension protection act of without any additional contributions 
at december   the market value of assets in our defined pension plan exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of our defined pension plan by million 
under sfas no 
 we recorded a million after tax credit million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  for our pension and other postretirement plans 
this credit reflected a basis point increase in the plans discount rate  combined with an increase in the value of the plan assets from favorable plan performance and the million contribution 
in  we recorded an after tax credit of million million pretax to shareholders equity as a result of a decrease in the accumulated pension benefit obligation  which resulted primarily from a basis point increase in the plan discount rate  combined with an increase in the value of the plan assets from favorable plan performance and the million contribution 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 which required us to record a net liability or asset to report the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our balance sheet 
as a result  we recorded after tax charges to shareholders equity of million and million for the pension and other postretirement plans  respectively  million and million pretax  respectively 
in  a basis point decline in interest rates and the cost impact of contractual pension plan changes more than offset the increase in the value of the plan assets 
therefore  we recorded in december an additional after tax charge of million million pretax as a result of an increase in the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
the non cash credits or charges to shareholders equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
in  we recorded million and million of net periodic pension benefit costs and other postretirement benefit costs  respectively  compared with million and million recorded in and million and million recorded in  respectively 
in  we recorded a defined benefit pension curtailment charge of million and other postretirement benefits curtailment credit of million related to the sale of the metals business  which were included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
also during  we recorded a curtailment charge of million resulting from the conversion of a portion of the metals hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
in  we recorded pension curtailment charges of million and million resulting from a portion of the winchester and metals hourly workforces  respectively  who voluntarily elected to transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
the metals portion of this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
after giving effect to the changes in curtailment charges and credits  the decrease in net periodic pension expense from was due to the combination of a basis point increase in discount rate for  the voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million in may and million in september  and the favorable performance on plan assets in after giving effect to the million curtailment charge in  the increase in net periodic pension expense from was due to the impact of a lower discount rate in and the higher amortization of plan losses  primarily investment losses on plan assets from prior periods 
the service cost and the amortization of prior service cost components of pension expense related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data 
therefore  the allocated portion of net periodic benefit costs for the metals business of million  million and million for  and  respectively  was included in income from discontinued operations 
the portion of other postretirement benefit costs for the metals business employees of million  million  and million for   and  respectively  was also included in income from discontinued operations

chlor alkali products sales increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of pioneer sales totaling million offset by lower ecu prices and slightly lower shipment volumes from the prior year from our chlor alkali operations  excluding pioneer 
winchester sales increased by million  or  from primarily due to increased selling prices and stronger volumes 
gross margin decreased million  or  from  primarily as a result of higher environmental costs of million primarily associated with an increase in costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency 
chlor alkali products gross margins declined slightly as the favorable results from the acquisition of pioneer were offset by lower ecu pricing and slightly lower shipment volumes 
this increase in environmental costs and lower chlor alkali margins were partially offset by lower pension costs and improved winchester gross margins from higher selling prices and improved volumes 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in this margin percentage decrease reflects higher environmental costs and lower chlor alkali margins offset in part by the higher winchester selling prices and lower pension costs 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in selling and administration expenses in were million higher than primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired pioneer operations million  higher management incentive compensation costs partially resulting from mark to market adjustments on stock based compensation million and increased salary and benefit costs million 
these increases were mostly offset by a lower level of legal and legal related settlement expenses million  decreased pension and postretirement expenses million  and lower consulting fees million 
other operating income for included the receipt of a million contingent payment associated with a divestiture and million of a gain realized on an intangible asset sale in chlor alkali products  which will be recognized ratably through other operating income for included a million insurance recovery for hurricane katrina business interruption experienced in and in early in our chlor alkali products operations and a gain of million on the disposition of a former manufacturing plant 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates were million for  an increase of million from  primarily due to slightly improved shipment volumes  decreased manufacturing costs  and lower depreciation expense at sunbelt  which was substantially offset by lower ecu prices at sunbelt 
interest expense increased by million  or  in  due to a higher level of outstanding debt 
interest income for was flat with as higher short term interest rates were offset by lower average cash and short term investment balances 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the domestic manufacturing deduction contained in the jobs creation act of  which increased from to in  and the utilization of certain state tax credits  which were offset in part by state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for included a million reduction in income tax expense associated with the settlement of certain audit issues related to the audits for the years to  principally the tax treatment of capital losses generated in and other tax matters 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of  which was reduced by this tax settlement  was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates offset in part by the domestic manufacturing deduction and utilization of certain state tax credits

income from discontinued operations before income taxes for was million higher than the metals pretax income for included a last in  first out lifo inventory liquidation gain of million as part of a metals inventory reduction program initiated in the metals pretax income for included a lifo inventory liquidation gain of million related to the closure of two of our former metals facilities  partially offset by restructuring charges of million related to the closure of these metals facilities 
the metals improved results also reflect higher selling prices and lower costs resulting from the restructuring and plant shutdown actions 
these factors more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volumes and higher energy and metal melting loss costs 
the effective tax rates were for compared with last year 
the effective tax rate was lower than due to the timing of income from certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at lower rates 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net for was million

gross margin was also impacted by recoveries from third parties of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of million in compared to million in gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in this margin percentage decrease reflected higher pension costs  which included a million pension curtailment charge resulting from the transition of a portion of the winchester hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan  higher environmental costs and lower environmental recoveries  offset in part by the higher ecu selling prices 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in selling and administration expenses in were lower by million than primarily due to a lower level of legal and legal related settlement expenses million  which were higher in due to costs associated with legacy environmental issues and recovery actions  lower bad debt expense million and decreased rent charges million primarily due to the relocation of our corporate office in connecticut 
the decreases were partially offset by increased pension expenses million  higher stock option compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas no

these items were partially offset in by increased interest income for investments on short term marketable securities which improved returns  higher short term interest rates  and higher average cash balances 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for included a million reduction in income tax expense associated with the settlement of certain audit issues related to the audits for the years to  principally the tax treatment of capital losses generated in and other tax matters 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of  which was reduced by the million  is higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes offset in part by the domestic manufacturing deduction and utilization of certain state tax credits 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations of for included a million reduction in income tax expense reduction in effective tax rate resulting from the refunds of interest paid in connection with the settlement of certain tax issues related to prior years 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and the accrual of interest on taxes which may become payable in the future 
income from discontinued operations  net for was million compared with million in  an increase of million 
income from discontinued operations before income taxes for was million higher than the metals segment income for included a lifo inventory liquidation gain of million related to the closure of two of our former metals facilities  which was partially offset by restructuring charges of million related to the closure of these metals facilities 
the metals improved results were also due to higher product pricing and lower costs resulting from the restructuring and plant shutdown actions 
these factors more than offset the negative impact of the higher operating costs  which included higher energy and metal melting loss costs 
the effective tax rates were for compared with for the effective tax rate was lower than due to the timing of income from certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at lower rates 
segment results we define segment results as income loss from continuing operations before interest expense  interest income  other income  and income taxes and include the results of non consolidated affiliates

also during  we recorded a curtailment charge of million resulting from the conversion of a portion of the metals hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were million for  compared to million in  which included recoveries from third parties of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of million 
these charges related primarily to expected future remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
the increase in charges compared to related primarily to a million increase in costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency and a million increase in costs associated with a former manufacturing operation 
for  other corporate and unallocated costs were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
legal and legal related settlement expenses decreased by million and consulting fees were lower by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased asset retirement obligation charges of million  primarily based on a higher probability of an earlier retirement of certain assets

outlook income from continuing operations in the first quarter of is projected to be in the per diluted share range compared with per diluted share in the first quarter of in chlor alkali products  we have experienced normal seasonal weakness in chlorine demand during the fourth quarter of which has continued into the first quarter of we have seen some weakness in chlorine demand from vinyls customers beyond the typical seasonal slowdown 
on february   we announced that we declared a force majeure for caustic soda system wide 
the force majeure was declared as a result of significant  unexpected operational interruptions in our caustic soda production capabilities  including plant shutdowns due to weather related  technical and equipment issues at several of our production facilities and the lack of chlorine demand which restricts our ability to produce caustic soda 
we currently expect to supply our customers with approximately of their typical contract volumes  subject to adjustment as circumstances dictate 
due to normal seasonal weakness  the vinyls sector weakness  and planned plant maintenance outages  we are projecting our operating rates to be in the low to mid range for the first quarter of  which compares to for the first quarter of we expect the first quarter of ecu prices to improve slightly over the fourth quarter of  driven by higher caustic soda prices 
the increase in first quarter caustic soda prices reflects the impact of the per ton price increase announced in the fourth quarter 
we do not expect the full impact of that price increase to be realized until the second quarter 
throughout  we will continue to realize synergies from the integration of the pioneer operations and our operations 
during the first quarter of  the pioneer corporate office in houston was closed  the space was subleased  and all of those activities have been consolidated into existing olin functions and facilities 
winchester results are expected to be about equal to the first quarter of as improved pricing and volumes are offset by higher commodity costs 
winchester has announced eleven price increases since the beginning of the most recent of these price increases was announced in the fourth quarter of and was effective january  in  winchester will experience a significant year over year increase in the price of lead 
winchester consumes approximately four times as much lead as copper 
we expect that law enforcement and military sales should continue at levels through in  we expect pension expense associated with the defined benefit plan to be approximately million lower compared to this reduction reflects an additional basis point increase in the discount rate  the benefits of the million voluntary contribution made in may  favorable asset performance in  and the benefits of the plan freeze 
this reduction will be partially offset by an approximate million increase in expenses associated with the defined contribution plan that replaced the defined benefit plan 
the first quarter of pension expense is expected to decline by approximately million compared to the first quarter of we currently anticipate that charges for environmental investigatory and remedial activities will be approximately lower than we believe the effective tax rate will be in the to range 
this rate reflects the impact of the pioneer canadian operations  the income of which is not eligible for the manufacturing deduction available under the jobs creation act of in  we forecast capital spending to be in the million to million range 
this forecast reflects the st 
gabriel facility conversion and expansion project spending of approximately million 
this project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of full year depreciation is forecast to be approximately million 
environmental matters in millions cash outlays remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays recoveries reserve for environmental liabilities beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending pioneer acquired liabilities currency translation adjustments ending balance remedial and investigatory spending was higher in and than due to an expansive investigation at a site and the implementation of remedial actions at five other sites 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
in the united states  the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
our canadian facilities are governed by federal environmental laws administered by environment canada and by provincial environmental laws enforced by administrative agencies 
many of these laws are comparable to the us laws described above 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
environmental provisions credits charged credited to income were as follows in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total provision credit these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
in conjunction with the acquisition of pioneer  we assumed their environmental liabilities  which are currently attributable to nine sites 
our estimated environmental liability at the end of  including the pioneer sites  was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
eleven sites accounted for of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at two of these eleven sites a remedial action plan is being implemented 
at four of the eleven sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one of these eleven sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation  part to a remedial action plan  and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one site  part of the site is subject to a remedial action plan and part of the site to long term om m 
the three remaining sites are in long term om m 
all eleven sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the eleven largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million  respectively  were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
as part of the acquisition of pioneer  we assumed million of environmental liabilities associated with their current and past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our environmental liability amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a 
risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related cash outlays  there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps  and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

metals payables increased from december  by million  primarily due to an increase in commodity metal prices 
capital expenditures capital spending was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to pioneer capital spending of million  which included million for the st 
gabriel chlor alkali facility conversion and expansion project and also spending required to increase bleach capacity in our chlor alkali products operations 
capital spending in included increased spending for the expansion of our bleach manufacturing capabilities and for enhancements to our railcar fleet in chlor alkali products operations 
these increases were partially offset by lower spending in winchester which completed the relocation of a product line in capital spending was   and of depreciation in   and  respectively 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range 
the increase is primarily attributable to the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project spending of approximately million 
this project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for chlorine railcars that were acquired in and this transaction reduced our fixed assets by approximately million

financing activities in august  we entered into a million letter of credit facility to assume the various pioneer letters of credit issued principally to support the acquisition of materials for the st 
gabriel chlor alkali facility conversion and expansion project 
on october   we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility of million  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility will expire in october we have the option to expand the million senior revolving credit facility by million through adding a maximum of two additional lending institutions each year 
at december  we had million available under this senior revolving credit facility  because we had issued million of letters of credit under a subfacility 
we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
it includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
this million senior revolving credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility which is in addition to the million letter of credit facility 
at december   we had letters of credit of million outstanding  of which million were issued under our million senior revolving facility 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt  capital expenditure commitments  certain workers compensation insurance policies  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
in addition to our senior revolving credit facility  we entered into two new credit facilities in june on june   we entered into a million credit facility and a million credit facility 
these commitments were put in place to support the funding of the pioneer acquisition 
the million credit facility matured on the earlier of june   or upon an increase in the lending commitments under our existing revolving credit facility and the establishment of an accounts receivable securitization facility  and the million credit facility would have matured on june  in the fourth quarter of  the million credit facility expired as all conditions for early termination were met and the million credit facility was terminated as we no longer needed the credit commitment 
on july   we established a million accounts receivable facility 
the accounts receivable facility provides for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to third party conduits through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial statement purposes 
during  we had aggregate borrowings under the accounts receivable facility of million and repayments of million 
also during  we had maximum borrowings outstanding of million under the accounts receivable facility 
as of december   we had nothing drawn under the accounts receivable facility  which expires in july as a result of the sale of metals  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
at december   we had million available under the accounts receivable facility based on eligible trade receivables 
we expect to include the pioneer accounts receivables during the first half of  which should increase the accounts receivable facility to approximately million 
the accounts receivable facility includes a letter of credit subfacility which is equal to of the amount of the facility  or currently million 
this subfacility is in addition to the million letter of credit facility and the million subfacility under the senior revolving credit facility 
during  million of the convertible notes and related million premium were repaid using drawings from our accounts receivable facility and cash 
in july  we issued million of notes and paid a premium of million to the existing note holders in exchange for million of notes 
in connection with the relocation of winchester s rimfire operations to oxford  ms  in november  we completed an industrial development revenue bond financing of million to utilize certain state tax incentives 
in june  we repaid the million  medium term series a notes  which became due

these shares were issued to satisfy the investment in our common stock resulting from employee contributions  our matching contributions and re invested dividends 
the percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december   from at year end and at year end the decrease from year end was due primarily to the higher shareholders equity resulting from the non cash credit for the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans 
the decrease from year end was due primarily to the higher shareholders equity resulting from the net income for the year dividends per common share were in  and total dividends paid on common stock amounted to million in  million in  and million in the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then current conditions  including our earnings  our operations  our financial conditions  our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors

liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and borrowings under our accounts receivable facility 
we also have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected by economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as vinyls  urethanes  and pulp and paper sectors 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity  including the capacity acquired with pioneer 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is a major financial institution 
we have designated the swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings 
accordingly  the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of million and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related debt 
no gain or loss has been recorded as the swaps met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment with no ineffectiveness 
in july  we received proceeds of million for the termination of a million interest rate swap that was a fair value hedge for a portion of the million notes that were part of the july debt exchange 
annual maturities of long term debt are million in  none in and  million in  none in  and a total of million thereafter 
commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable facility are additional sources of liquidity 
we utilize a credit facility of million and standby letters of credit 
in august  we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility is described above under the caption  financing activities 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt  capital expenditure commitments  certain workers compensation insurance policies  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
we use operating leases for certain properties  such as railroad cars  distribution  warehousing and office space  and data processing and office equipment 
virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions 
future minimum rent payments under operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at december  are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and a total of million thereafter 
assets under capital leases are not significant 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a million sale leaseback transaction for chlorine railcars that were acquired in and on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are million per year for through and million in this supply agreement expires in at december   we had million registered securities available for issuance with the sec  whereby from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock  and associated warrants 
we and our partner  polyone own equally sunbelt 
oxy vinyls is required to purchase thousand tons of chlorine based on a formula related to its market price 
prior to july  polyone had an ownership interest in oxy vinyls 
we market the excess chlorine and all of the caustic soda produced 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due sunbelt sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if sunbelt does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of sunbelt for repayment 
if we were to make debt service payments under our guarantee  we would have a right to recover such payments from sunbelt 
beginning on december  and each year through  sunbelt is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million 
in the event sunbelt cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund the payment on the series o notes 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in sunbelt and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being transferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party 
excluding our guarantee of the sunbelt notes described above  our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements a contingent tax liability fin qualified pension plan contributions b non qualified pension plan payments postretirement benefit payments b off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases purchasing commitments raw materials utilities total a for the purposes of this table  we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the principal amount of any variable rate debt from the amounts outstanding on december  and that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at december  which ranged from to 
b these amounts are only estimated payments assuming the continuation of postretirement benefits  a growth rate of for and for estimated healthcare cost inflation  an annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of  and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 
these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more or less than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year in the case of pensions 
for our qualified pension plans  we believe additional cash contributions will be required no sooner than see discussion on pension protection act of in pension plans and retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension plans and retirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the pension plans and retirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these other postretirement plans are not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  discount rates  and comparable company trading multiples 
based on our evaluation prepared in the fourth quarter of  no impairment charge was recorded 
environmental accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension  sfas no 
 respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
additionally  gains and losses are amortized over the group s service lifetime  to the extent they fall outside of a corridor designed to dampen annual volatility 
the average remaining service lives of the employees in the defined benefit plan is years 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the group  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased  respectively  the pension cost by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension costs by million and the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension costs by million and the projected benefit obligation by million

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas no 
r 
this statement requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all asset acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires additional disclosures by the acquirer 
under this statement  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
this statement will be effective for us on january  and will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date 
earlier application is prohibited 
we are continuing to evaluate the future effect of this statement on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  sfas no 

this statement will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
the statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
this statement will be effective for us on january  earlier application is prohibited 
this statement will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date except that comparative period information must be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity  attribute net income and other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests  and provide additional required disclosures 
it is expected that this statement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
which permitted an entity to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement s objective was to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and was to be applied prospectively 
as we do not intend to measure existing assets and liabilities at fair value on the date of adoption  the adoption of this statement will not affect our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement required that a company recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pensions and other postretirement plans on its balance sheet and measure benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the company s balance sheet date 
the portion of this statement related to recognizing a net liability for the funded status became effective for fiscal years ending after december  at december   we recorded an after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million million pretax 
the measurement date of the assets and benefit obligations requirements will be effective for fiscal years ending after december  we currently use our year end balance sheet date as our measurement date and  as a result  the new measurement requirement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

this statement did not require any new fair value measurements  but rather  it provided enhanced guidance to other pronouncements that require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement related to the definition of fair value  the methods used to estimate fair value  and the requirement for expanded disclosures about estimates of fair value 
this statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the effective date for this statement for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis has been delayed by one year 
it is expected that this statement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  which amended certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide  audits of airlines and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
this position prohibited the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods 
this position became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented 
previously  our accrual for planned major maintenance costs did not extend past year end  but was accrued within the year for the year 
this position did not have a material effect on our financial statements  and therefore  no restatements were made 
in september  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatement when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab no 

the bulletin provided guidance on assessing the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements were materially misstated 
sab no 
required that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach included both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
sab no 
was effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 

this interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 

fin no 
prescribed a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provided guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
this interpretation was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  as a result of the implementation  we recognized a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which has been accounted for as an increase to accumulated deficit 
derivative financial instruments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 required an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
required that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and  we had no forward contracts to buy or to sell foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange losses gains  net of taxes  were million in and million in and we use cash flow hedges of certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding fixed rate debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
gains losses on settled futures contracts  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in at december   we had open positions in futures contracts totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a gain of million 
at december  and  accumulated other comprehensive loss included a pretax gain in fair value of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in million  million and zero charged credited to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there were in assets totaling million million and liabilities of million million 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting 
the effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for   and was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities  our ongoing investing and financing activities  and our operations that use foreign currencies 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our winchester segment products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable facility are sources of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the terms of the swaps are the same as the underlying debt instruments 
assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact annual interest expense by million 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations as of december  underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  floating rate in millions  due december  due march a industrial development and environmental improvement obligations at interest rates of to  due march march a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense by million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in july  we received proceeds of million for the termination of a million interest rate swap that was a fair value hedge for a portion of the million notes that were part of the july debt exchange 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
