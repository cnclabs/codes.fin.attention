the market for life insurance  retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more similar products 
according to am best  as of december   the allstate financial segment is the nation s th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of ordinary life insurance in force and th largest on the basis of statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for billion 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the decreases in net reserves established as of december  to december  reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
favorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parenthesis 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions total by accident year prior total in  favorable prior year reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  and  favorable prior year reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in  also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines  partially offset by favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses 
favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in through were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the three years for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
agent and broker compensation 
in recent years  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york and texas  and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in california and utah 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in california  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  texas  and utah 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups in various states 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own wyo carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency fema 
we operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the standard flood insurance policy sfip 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commission and adjuster fees 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  states limit  to varying degrees  an insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale and administration of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  finra and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted

these forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like plans  seeks  expects  will  should  anticipates  estimates  intends  believes  likely  targets and other words with similar meanings 
these statements may address  among other things  our strategy for growth  catastrophe exposure management  product development  regulatory approvals  market position  expenses  financial results  litigation and reserves 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
these risks constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and historical trends 
these cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document  in our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism 
we may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of those experienced in prior years  in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis  in excess of those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability  in excess of the average expected level used in pricing  and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits 
while we believe that our catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future losses due to natural catastrophes  we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  the northridge earthquake of totaling billion and hurricane andrew in totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority  and various state created catastrophe insurance facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to catastrophe losses although  along with others in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios  such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
these limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models and modelers  material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements  assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability  and actual event conditions that have not been well understood previously and not incorporated into the models 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of actual demand surge  loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses  which are subject to wide variation by event or location 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth we believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings  while providing quality protection to our customers  will be successful over the long term  however they have a negative impact on near term growth  earnings and reputation 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to the diminished potential for cross selling opportunities  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas during although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment has experienced a long term decline in claim frequency 
other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline 
we believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors  including increases in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders  improvements in car and road safety  aging of the population  increased driver education and restrictions for new drivers  decreases in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses  more cars than drivers per household  and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria 
the short term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant long term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix  and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines is inherently uncertain the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be  covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves  these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
consequently  ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial position 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  when allstate protection s loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may impose rate rollbacks  require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability  in all product lines  to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  or as the facilities recognize a financial deficit  they may  in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers  adversely affecting our results of operations 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing our sophisticated risk segmentation process tiered pricing may not be fully realized we believe that tiered pricing and underwriting including strategic risk management which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our tiered pricing model 
furthermore  we can not be assured that tiered pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated 
moreover  to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers  our expectation that the amount of business written using tiered pricing will increase may not be realized 
allstate protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts  satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis  which could result in the discontinuation of products or distribution relationships and a decline in sales 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment spreads  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability 
changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment spread 
lowering interest crediting rates in such an environment can offset decreases in investment yield on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals and accelerating maturities of institutional products 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads and reduce profitability 
unanticipated surrenders could result in accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
assumptions underlying egp  including those relating to margins from mortality  investment margin  contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of dac 
updates to these assumptions could result in dac unlocking  which in turn could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to investments we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality although we are exploring the possibility of adopting an enhanced asset allocation model to assess our exposure to market risk on an enterprise wide basis  rather than on a more limited business unit basis  and to improve overall returns without increasing enterprise portfolio risk  we will remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in addition  we are subject to potential declines in credit quality  either related to issues specific to certain industries or to a weakening in the economy in general 
although to some extent we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks  the effectiveness of such instruments is subject to the same risks 
for additional information on market risk  see the market risk section of management s discussion and analysis 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or otherwise riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
a declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease or decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other post retirement benefit plans to increase  either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the plans and a reduction of shareholders equity  increases in pension expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to equity and derivative strategies 
deteriorating financial performance on securities collateralized by mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans may lead to write downs we continue to believe that the unrealized losses on securities collateralized by mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans are not necessarily predictive of the performance of the underlying collateral  and that  in the absence of further deterioration in the collateral relative to our positions in the securities respective capital structure  we expect the unrealized losses should reverse over the remaining lives of the securities 
however  future market conditions could cause us to alter that outlook 
changes in mortgage delinquency or recovery rates  credit rating changes by rating agencies  bond insurer strength or rating  and the quality of service provided by service providers on securities in our portfolios could lead us to determine that write downs are appropriate in the future 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because many of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals 
we may suffer losses from litigation as is typical for a large company  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period 
for a description of our current legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in some circumstances  we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we may be required to pay in judgments  settlements and litigation expenses 
however  we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability  if any  or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation 
consequently  the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and  therefore  may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  financial industry regulatory authority  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates we predicted in our estimate of the cost for the current year allstate floridian program will be available 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the event that terrorist acts occur  both allstate protection and allstate financial could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the insurance financial strength ratings of both allstate insurance company and allstate life insurance company are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and  if known  our estimates of their expected impact  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the change in our unrecognized tax benefit during the next months is subject to uncertainty as required by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which was adopted as of january   we have disclosed our estimate of net unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonably possible increase or decrease in its balance during the next months 
however  actual results may differ from our estimate for reasons such as changes in our position on specific issues  developments with respect to the governments interpretations of income tax laws or changes in judgment resulting from new information obtained in audits or the appeals process 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt and complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows allstate recognizes the scientific view that the world is getting warmer 
climate change  to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns  could impact the frequency or severity of extreme weather events and wildfires 
such changes could also impact the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance 
to the extent that climate change impacts mortality rates and those changes do not match the long term mortality assumptions in our product pricing  our allstate financial segment would be impacted 
loss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations we rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad 
these include  for example  vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services 
in the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services  we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses

the most critical estimates include those used in determining investment fair value and impairment derivative instrument hedge accounting and fair value deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates  see the referenced sections of this document

investment fair value and impairment the fair value of our investments in fixed income and equity securities is based on observable market quotations  other market observable data  or is derived from such quotations and market observable data 
we utilize third party pricing servicers  brokers and internal valuation models to determine fair value 
we gain assurance of the overall reasonableness and consistent application of the assumptions and methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through our ongoing monitoring of the fair values received or derived internally 
our exposure to changes in market conditions is discussed more fully in the market risk section of the md a 
we are responsible for the determination of fair value and the supporting assumptions and methodologies 
we employ independent third party pricing servicers to gather  analyze  and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant assumptions and methodologies for each applicable security 
in situations where sufficient market observable information is not available for a particular security through the sources as agreed to with us  no quote is provided by the service providers 
for these securities  fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote or we internally determine fair values employing widely accepted pricing valuation models 
changing market conditions in the fourth quarter of  were incorporated into valuation assumptions  and reflected in the fair values which were validated by calibration and other analytical techniques to available market observable data 
third party pricing servicers consolidate market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and provide pricing information in the form of a single fair value for each security for which a fair value request is agreed 
for equity securities  which comprise approximately of our holdings  they provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date 
the other fair values provided are derived from their proprietary pricing models 
the sources used by these servicers include  but are not limited to  market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities  interest rate yield curves  credit spreads  currency rates  and other market observable information as applicable  as well as widely accepted valuation models developed on a proprietary basis 
their proprietary pricing models are based on discounted cashflow methodology and they may take into account  among other things  market observable information as of the measurement date from the sources described above  and the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term  interest rate and credit rating consistent with those we use to report our holdings by credit rating  industry sector  and where applicable  collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information 
to operate these models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience 
in cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited  the degree of judgment varies with the availability of market observable information 
for approximately of our holdings  where our third party pricing servicers cannot provide fair value determinations for fixed income securities  we obtain quotes from brokers familiar with the security who may consider transactions or activity in similar securities  if any  among other information  similar to our third party pricing servicers 
the brokers providing the quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making  underwriting and distribution expertise 
the fair value of securities  such as privately placed securities  where our pricing servicers or brokers cannot provide fair value determinations  is determined using widely accepted valuation methods and models 
these internally developed models are appropriate for each class of security  involve some degree of judgment  and include inputs that may not be market observable 
our models are based on discounted cash flow methodology and calculate a single best estimate of fair value for each security 
our internally developed pricing models use credit ratings and liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities which are difficult to independently observe and verify 
inputs used in these fair value estimates include specific attributes of the security being valued including  coupon rate  weighted average life  an internal credit rating assigned by us  which is generally consistent with any external ratings and those we use to report our holdings by credit rating  sector of the issuer  and call provisions 
our assumptions incorporate market information as of the measurement date that represents what we believe independent third parties would use to determine fair value  which include interest rate yield curves  quoted market prices of comparable securities  credit spreads  estimated liquidity premiums and other applicable market data 
our assumption for liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities reduces the value of these securities to reflect their reduced liquidity as compared to similar securities that are publicly traded 
additionally  no assumption is included in the valuation of privately placed securities for an increase to the value to reflect the generally enhanced structural features of the securities  such as covenants or change of control protection 
however  judgment is required in developing these estimates and  as a result  the estimated fair value of these securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an orderly sale of the securities at the measurement date 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair values 
we employ control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities 
our processes are designed to assure the values provided are accurately recorded and that the data and the valuation method utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and representative of fair value 
for example  we may validate the reasonableness of prices by comparing the information obtained from our pricing vendors to other third party pricing sources for certain securities 
our control processes also include reviews  when fair value determinations are expected to be more variable  by management with relevant expertise and management who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions  of these fair value determinations to validate their reasonableness 
the following table identifies those investments carried at fair value as of december  by method of determination investments in millions carrying value percent to total fair value based on internal sources  fair value based on external sources  total fixed income and equity securities  fair value of derivatives mortgage loans  policy loans  bank loans and certain limited partnership and other investments  valued at cost  amortized cost and the equity method  total  for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities  net of certain other items and deferred income taxes as disclosed in note  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security s fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors 
for our portfolio review evaluations  we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration  revisions to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  as well as any dispositions anticipated by the portfolio managers 
in these instances  we recognize impairments on securities designated as subject to these approved anticipated actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issue or issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result  any related net unrealized loss would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the determination of the amount of impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluation of the factors described above 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the determination of the fair value of investments and the timing and amount of impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements

derivative instrument hedge accounting and fair value we primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset liability management  particularly in the allstate financial segment 
when derivatives meet specific criteria  they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value  cash flow  foreign currency fair value  or foreign currency cash flow hedges 
when designating a derivative as an accounting hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship and risk management objective and strategy 
the documentation identifies the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
we do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment 
at each reporting date  we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under the applicable accounting standards 
if it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in differing impacts on our financial statements from those previously reported 
measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to evolving interpretations and estimations which may have a material effect on net income 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on observable market quotations in active markets  whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is determined using widely accepted pricing models and other appropriate valuation methods 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment and include inputs that may not be observable in the market 
the fair value of derivatives  depending on the type of derivative  can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  market volatility and liquidity 
values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions used in pricing models 
such assumptions include estimates of volatility  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  other financial indices and credit ratings 
included in the analysis of the fair value is the risk of counterparty default 
the use of different assumptions may have material effects on the estimated derivative fair value amounts  as well as the amount of reported net income 
also  fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting may result in significant volatility in net income

deferred policy acquisition cost amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business 
in accordance with gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment returns  which include investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as mortality  persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
the assumptions for determining dac amortization and recoverability are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate reserves for life contingent contract benefits 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization periods for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the policies 
the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of this business 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these contracts on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining dac balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency 
dac related to interest sensitive life  annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits  which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the amortization is net of interest on the prior period dac balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts 
actual amortization periods generally range from years  however  incorporating estimates of customer surrender rates  partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized during the surrender charge period 
the cumulative dac amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to results of operations when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total egp 
agp and egp consist of the following components benefit margins primarily from cost of insurance contract charges less mortality  investment margins including realized capital gains and losses  and expense margins including surrender and other contract charges  less maintenance expenses 
the amount of egp is principally dependent on assumptions for investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to policyholders  the effect of any hedges  persistency  mortality and expenses 
of these factors  we anticipate that investment returns  credited interest  persistency  mortality  and expenses are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of dac amortization 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time 
each reporting period  dac amortization is recognized in proportion to agp for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period dac balance 
this amortization process includes an assessment of agp compared to egp  the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss 
if the agp is less than egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged  the amount of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result generally occurs when the agp exceeds the egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged 
annually we review all assumptions underlying the projections of egp  including investment returns  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses 
management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of egp 
at each reporting period we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine dac amortization are required 
these reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration  which are commonly referred to as dac unlocking 
if the update of assumptions causes total egp to increase  the rate of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
a decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total egp to decrease 
over the past three years  our most significant dac assumption updates that resulted in a change to egp and the amortization of dac have been revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  mortality and in force or persistency assumptions resulting in net dac amortization deceleration of million in  net dac amortization acceleration of million in  and net dac amortization deceleration of million in the amortization deceleration included million related to our subsequently disposed variable annuity business for which we no longer have any dac  but was largely offset by million of amortization acceleration related to investment contracts 
the amortization acceleration on fixed annuity investment contracts was primarily due to higher than expected lapses on market value adjusted annuities and faster than anticipated investment portfolio yield declines

reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued 
property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
the significant lines of business are auto  homeowners  and other lines for allstate protection  and asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines for discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection s claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle  while auto physical damage  homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year 
discontinued lines and coverages involve long tail losses  such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims  which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve reestimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserves estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts  paid losses  case reserves  and development factors calculated with this data 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period 
the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development  as the significant size of our experience data base achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level  and the results of these numerous micro level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate 
for example  over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process 
development factors are calculated quarterly for data elements such as  claim counts reported and settled  paid losses  and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity average cost per claim trends  which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these micro level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves 
moreover  this detailed micro level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
reserves are reestimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors 
this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
new development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results claims reported or settled  losses paid  or changes to case reserves occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations 
if claims reported  paid losses  or case reserves changes are greater or lower than the levels estimated by previous development factors  reserve reestimates increase or decrease 
when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve reestimate and an increase or decrease in property liability insurance claims and claims expense will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
total property liability reserve reestimates  after tax  as a percent of net income  in  and were  and  respectively 
for property liability  the year average of reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a favorable  for allstate protection  the year average of reserve estimates was a favorable and for discontinued lines and coverages the year average of reserve reestimates was an unfavorable  each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses 
allstate protection reserve reestimates were primarily the result of claim severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected due to lower frequency trends  and for discontinued lines and coverages  reestimates were primarily a result of increased reported claim activity claims frequency 
a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
the following table shows claims and claims expense reserves by operating segment and line of business as of december in millions allstate protection auto    homeowners    other lines    total allstate protection    discontinued lines and coverages asbestos    environmental other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages    total property liability    allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two year  three year  or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line  coverage  or state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimating techniques previously described 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
historically  the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims 
to provide for this  a development reserve is estimated using previously described processes  and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves 
typically  the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about of total reserves 
another major component of reserves is ibnr 
typically  ibnr comprises about of total reserves 
generally  the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments  lines  and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators  and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes previously described 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts equipment price index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various other loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors  limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements 
however  by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types  comprising auto injury losses  auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes  and to medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter 
reserves for catastrophe losses property liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes  and volcanoes 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
as an example  in to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff  or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive  we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total policies in force  as well as visual  governmental and third party information  including aerial photos  area observations  and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available 
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro level estimates for each business segment  line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates  there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level 
moreover  management does not compile a range of reserve estimates because management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful 
reserve estimates  by their very nature  are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment  and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim 
accordingly  as actual claims  and or paid losses  and or case reserve results emerge  our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  an actuarial technique stochastic modeling is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses  auto physical damage losses  and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses 
based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last eleven years for each type of loss 
the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  the statistical credibility of our extensive data  and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses  which comprise approximately of reserves  due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims 
other types of losses  such as auto physical damage  homeowners losses and other losses  which comprise about of reserves  tend to have greater variability  but are settled in a much shorter period of time 
although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large united states companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on large us companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg environmental damages  respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties  appropriateness and cost of remediation to pollution and related clean up costs 
the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs  and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities  initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims  often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur 
after evaluating our insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and or environmental claims  we evaluate our insureds coverage programs for such claims 
we consider our insureds total available insurance coverage  including the coverage we issued 
we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel 
based on these evaluations  case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve  which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
as of december   ibnr was of combined asbestos and environmental reserves 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
other discontinued lines and coverages reserves for other discontinued lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  and are presented in the following table 
in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws  regulations  and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation benefits for these contracts are payable over many years  accordingly  the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums 
long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies including traditional life insurance  life contingent annuities and voluntary health products 
these assumptions  which for life contingent annuities and traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of annuity benefit or coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued  are consistent with assumptions for determining dac amortization for these contracts  and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period 
however  if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions  adjustments to dac or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves and recoverability of dac for these contracts on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
in the event that actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the effects of changes in reserve estimates are reported in the results of operations in the period in which the changes are determined 
the company has not recognized a charge of this nature in the three years ended december  we anticipate that mortality  investment and reinvestment yields  and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require adjustment to these reserves or related dac

property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection is comprised of two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income loss  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income on page  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
net income is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income loss 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income loss as a percentage of premiums earned 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio is equal to the property liability combined ratio 
summarized financial data  a reconciliation of underwriting income loss to net income and gaap operating ratios for our property liability operations for the years ended december  are presented in the following table

the key elements of the allstate protection strategy of consumer focus  innovation and loyalty are strategic marketing to drive growth expand and increase effectiveness of distribution maintain leadership in pricing sophistication provide innovative products and services extend claims competitive advantage maintain a strong support foundation by continuing to effectively manage people  investments  technology and capital in our strategy for the allstate brand  we are seeking  through the utilization of our distribution channels  our sophisticated risk segmentation process tiered pricing and targeted consumer marketing  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we maintain a comprehensive marketing approach throughout the us we have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on allstate brand profitability  pif growth  retention  and sales of financial products 
we differentiate the allstate brand from competitors by offering a choice of products  including allstate yca with options such as safe driving deductibles and a safe driving bonus  allstate ych with options such as a claim free bonus and greater ability to tailor insurance coverage  allstate blue our non standard auto product with features such as a loyalty bonus and roadside assistance coverage and allstate green  our new eco friendly insurance option that offers consumers a convenient way to help the environment 
our strategy for the encompass brand includes enhancing pricing and product sophistication through our tiered pricing approach with the encompass edge product  increasing distribution effectiveness and improving agency technology interfaces to support profitable growth 
we are positioning the brand to expand product breadth and improve independent agency penetration by leveraging technology and service capabilities 
tiered pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential  and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard non standard model 
tiered pricing includes our strategic risk management program  which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including  to the extent legally permissible  insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
we continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases 
substantially all of new and approximately of renewal business written for allstate brand auto uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand homeowners  approximately of new and of renewal business written uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business  our results indicate that over time  tiered pricing has improved our mix of customers towards those who we consider high lifetime value that generally have better retention and more favorable loss experience 
usually  standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers 
we are pursuing improvements in the overall customer experience through actions targeted to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
these programs are designed around establishing customer service expectations and customer relationship building 
our claims strategy focuses on delivering fast  fair and consistent claim service while achieving loss cost management and customer satisfaction 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and our direct channel 
we continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure in order to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings  while providing protection to our customers 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property lines 
as of december   we have surpassed our goal to have no more than a likelihood of exceeding our expected annual aggregate catastrophe losses by billion  net of reinsurance  based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available 
the use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss 
property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes  wildfires  fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including fewer restrictions on underwriting  recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for large catastrophes 
while the actions that we take will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
accordingly  property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  encompass standard auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and non standard auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position

the encompass brand dac amortization is higher on average than allstate brand dac amortization due to higher commission rates 
dac we establish a dac asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business  principally agents remuneration  premium taxes  certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation expenses

however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the california earthquake authority cea  florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf or placed with a third party  such as hurricane coverage in hawaii 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was points since the beginning of comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years through is shown in the following table 
average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki  and losses from california earthquakes florida other hurricane exposure states total hurricane exposure states all other total over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the fhcf  which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities 
actions we have taken or are considering to maintain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our property business include purchasing reinsurance or engaging in other forms of risk transfer arrangements  limitations on new business writings  not offering continuing coverage to some existing policyholders  withdrawing from certain geographic markets  changes in rates  deductibles and coverage  changes to underwriting requirements  including limitations in coastal and adjacent counties  discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences  and or removing wind coverage from certain policies and allowing our agencies to help customers apply for wind coverage through state facilities such as wind pools 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
generally  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas 
however  average premiums are not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss 
we have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by  among other actions  purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes for further information on our reinsurance program see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a  limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states  not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states  and entering into royal palm and royal palm our actions are expected to continue during in northeastern and certain other hurricane prone states 
earthquakes during  we began taking actions countrywide to significantly reduce our exposure to the risk of earthquake losses 
these actions included purchasing reinsurance on a countrywide basis and in the state of kentucky  no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states  removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states  and entering into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business 
allstate s premiums written attributable to optional earthquake coverage totaled approximately million in compared to million in additional reductions in policies in force are anticipated in upon completion of these actions  we expect to retain only approximately  policies in force due to regulatory and other reasons 
we also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies and coverages that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses  including our auto policies  and to fires following earthquakes 
allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea  a privately financed  publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage 
allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements 
fires following earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in california and purchasing additional reinsurance on a countrywide basis excluding florida and on a statewide basis in california and kentucky 
wildfires actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states and including california wildfire losses in our aggregate excess reinsurance agreement 
catastrophe losses related to the southern california wildfires that occurred during october totaled million 
allstate protection outlook allstate protection premiums written in are anticipated to be slightly higher than levels 
we expect continued growth of allstate brand standard auto premiums written due to increased pif resulting from improved agency effectiveness and further optimization in our advertising and higher average premium  partially offset by the impact of competition and the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on homeowners and other property premiums 
we will continue the introduction of our innovative products and services 
allstate blue is anticipated to contribute positively to the non standard written premium trends and our presence in the non standard market 
encompass edge is expected to contribute to the encompass growth trends 
loss costs are expected to increase faster than average premiums 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however  this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions  including purchases of reinsurance 
we plan to continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
any reductions in costs we achieve  however  may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives  such as expenditures for marketing and technology 
we expect advertising expense in to be comparable to discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment

underwriting loss of million in primarily related to an million reestimate of asbestos reserves  a million reestimate of environmental reserves and a million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million 
see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
because of our annual ground up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we continue to be encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity has slowed  perhaps reflecting various state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims

property liability claims and claims expense reserves property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
for a description of our reserve process  see note of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
the facts and circumstances leading to our quarterly reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately million in net income

in  this was primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected  partially offset by unfavorable reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
in and  this was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected and changes in reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses which were favorable in and unfavorable in these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations 
the impact of these reestimates on the allstate brand underwriting income loss is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates  allstate brand underwriting income loss   reserve reestimates as a of underwriting income loss encompass brand reserve reestimates in  and were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs 
the impact of these reestimates on the encompass brand underwriting income loss is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates encompass brand underwriting income loss reserve reestimates as a of underwriting income loss discontinued lines and coverages we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by policyholders

they were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess and primary insurance policyholders with existing active claims  excess policyholders with new claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation and bankruptcy actions 
the asbestos reserve addition also includes the write off of uncollectible reinsurance for a single foreign reinsurer 
the reserve additions for environmental in were for increased claim activity related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up have been more fully determined 
this increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported

this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in  the asbestos survival ratio declined due to continuing claim payments 
in  the asbestos survival ratios improved due to reserve additions and a reduced level of claim payments 
in  the environmental survival ratios improved due to reserve additions

we purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  which are backed by the financial resources of the property liability insurance company market participants  and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense reinsurance recoverables  net in millions industry pools and facilities     asbestos and environmental   other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables   total property liability     reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  including incurred but not reported unpaid losses 
we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement  including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement 
we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements 
accordingly  our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserve for property liability claims and claims expense 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances 
the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  and other relevant factors 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries 
for further discussion on the decrease in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future

we also expect to place contracts for the state of florida later this year  once the florida hurricane catastrophe fund s plans are known  and to have them effective for the hurricane season beginning on june  the multi peril agreements have various retentions and limits commensurate with the amount of catastrophe risk  measured on an annual basis  in each covered state 
the multi peril agreement for connecticut and rhode island provides that losses resulting from the same occurrence but taking place in both states may be combined to meet the agreement s per occurrence retention and limit 
a description of these retentions and limits appears in the following tables and charts 
one third of the coverage expires each year with each of the three contracts in this agreement 
the north east agreement was placed with a cayman island insurance company  willow re ltd  that had completed an offering to unrelated investors for principal at risk  variable market rate notes of million to collateralize hurricane catastrophe losses covered by this agreement 
amounts payable under the reinsurance agreement will be based on an index created by applying predetermined percentages representing our market share  to insured personal property and auto industry losses in the covered area as reported by property claim services pcs  a division of insurance services offices  inc  limited to our actual losses 
the north east agreement provides that losses arising from the same occurrence but taking place in the three states may be combined to meet the agreement s per occurrence retention and limit 
the florida reinsurance program that is expected to be effective june  will replace the current program and should be similar in design  assuming there is no further change in florida insurance laws  however with lower retentions and limits as our exposures have been reduced 
our current program comprises  four separate agreements  entered into by allstate floridian for personal property excess catastrophe losses in florida  effective june  for one year 
these agreements coordinate coverage with the fhcf  including our elected participation in the optional temporary increase in coverage limit ticl  collectively fhcf 
the four agreements are listed and described below 
fhcf retention provides coverage on million of losses in excess of million and is placed  with one reinstatement of limit 
fhcf sliver provides coverage on co participation of the fhcf payout  or million and is placed  with one reinstatement of limit 
fhcf back up provides coverage after the fhcf reimbursement protection is utilized on million of losses in excess of million and is placed 
fhcf excess provides coverage on million of losses in excess of the fhcf retention and the fhcf back up agreements and is placed  with one reinstatement of limit 
the fhcf provides reimbursement on qualifying allstate floridian property losses up to an estimated maximum of million in excess of a retention of million  including reimbursement of eligible loss adjustment expenses at  for each of the two largest hurricanes and million for all other hurricanes for the season beginning june  recoveries from the fhcf on policies included in our reinsurance agreements with universal insurance company and royal palm  respectively  are ceded to those companies in proportion to total losses qualifying for recovery 
in addition  certain recoveries from our four florida reinsurance agreements attributable to policies reinsured under our reinsurance agreement with royal palm are remitted to royal palm in proportion to total losses qualifying for recovery 
we have approximately million or of the aggregate excess agreement limits for the june  to may  period  million or of the south east agreement limit  million or of the north east agreement limit and million or of the florida component placed with alternative market sources 
alternative market sources refers to a reinsurer that hedge funds  private equity firms  or investment banks substantially or wholly support  retrocedes of its assumed liability to a specific retrocessionaire  provides collateral to us equal to its assumed per occurrence limit  or funding is provided by an unrelated third party issuance of bonds financing the reinsurance limit catastrophe bond 
we estimate that the total annualized cost of all catastrophe reinsurance programs for the year beginning june  will be approximately million per year or million per quarter  including an estimate for reinsurance coverage in florida 
this is compared to approximately million per year for our total annualized cost for the year beginning june   or an estimated annualized cost decrease of million beginning june  the estimated decrease is due in part to our reduced exposure in florida following our non renewal activities over the past year 
the total cost of our reinsurance programs during was million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
the cost during is estimated to be million in the first quarter of  million in the second quarter and million in the third and fourth quarters 
we continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities 
we are currently involved in proceedings regarding homeowners insurance rates and our ability to capture these reinsurance costs in various states including california  florida and texas 
since the financial condition of the reinsurer is a critical deciding factor when entering into an agreement  the reinsurance agreements have been placed in the global reinsurance market with all limits on our florida program and the majority of limits on our other programs placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating of a or better 
the remaining limits are placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating no lower than a  with three exceptions 
one of the exceptions has a standard poor s s p rating of aa  one has a rating of aa and we have collateral for the entire contract limit exposure for the reinsurer which is not rated by either rating agency 
because of these factors  we do not expect that our ability to cede losses in the future will be impaired

net income increased in compared to  due to higher revenues  partially offset by higher total costs and expenses and the recognition in of losses relating to the disposition of substantially all of our variable annuity business 
analysis of revenues total revenues decreased or million in compared to  due to higher net realized capital losses and lower premiums and contract charges  partially offset by higher net investment income 
total revenues increased or million in compared to due to higher net investment income partially offset by net realized capital losses in compared to net realized capital gains in  and lower premiums and contract charges 
life and annuity premiums and contract charges premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance  immediate annuities with life contingencies  accident and health and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk 
contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive and variable life insurance  fixed annuities  institutional products and variable annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities 
contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance  administration  cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates 
as a result  changes in contractholder funds are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues 
subsequent to the close of our reinsurance transaction with prudential effective june   variable annuity contract charges on the business subject to the transaction are fully reinsured to prudential and presented net of reinsurance on the consolidated statements of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements

total premiums decreased in compared to as higher sales of accident and health insurance products sold through the allstate workplace division and traditional life insurance products were more than offset by a decline in sales of life contingent immediate annuities due to market competitiveness 
total premiums decreased in compared to excluding the impact of the transfer of the loan protection business to the allstate protection segment effective january   premiums increased in compared to this increase in was attributable primarily to increased premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies  due to certain pricing refinements and a more favorable pricing environment in additionally  in  excluding the impact of the transfer of the loan protection business  accident and health and other premiums increased million due to increased sales of these products 
contract charges decreased in compared to due to the disposal of substantially all of our variable annuity business through reinsurance effective june  excluding contract charges on variable annuities  substantially all of which are reinsured to prudential effective june   contract charges increased in compared to this increase reflects growth in interest sensitive life insurance policies in force and  to a lesser extent  higher contract charges on fixed annuities 
the increase in contract charges on fixed annuities was mostly attributable to higher contract surrenders 
contract charges decreased in compared to excluding contract charges on variable annuities  contract charges increased in compared to the increase was mostly due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life products resulting from growth of business in force 
contract charges on fixed annuities were slightly higher in due to increased surrender charges 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products  such as interest sensitive life insurance  fixed annuities  funding agreements and bank deposits 
the balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities  benefits  surrenders  withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses 
the following table shows the changes in contractholder funds

the table above is intended to supplement our discussion and analysis of revenues  which are presented net of reinsurance on the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  the net change in contractholder funds associated with products reinsured to third parties is reflected as a component of the other adjustments line 
this includes  but is not limited to  the net change in contractholder funds associated with the reinsured variable annuity business subsequent to the effective date of our reinsurance agreements with prudential see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractholder funds decreased in and increased and in and  respectively 
average contractholder funds increased in compared to  in compared to and in compared to contractholder deposits decreased in compared to this decline was primarily due to lower deposits on fixed annuities partially offset by higher deposits on funding agreements 
the decline of in fixed annuity deposits in compared to was due to our strategy to raise new business returns for these products combined with lower industry wide fixed annuity sales 
deposits on institutional products increased in compared to sales of our institutional products vary from period to period based on management s assessment of market conditions 
contractholder deposits decreased in compared to due to decreased deposits on funding agreements and  to a lesser extent  the classification of the net change in variable annuity contractholder funds as other adjustments subsequent to the effective date of our reinsurance agreements with prudential 
these items were partially offset by higher fixed annuity deposits 
allstate financial prioritized the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of retail products having the best opportunity for sustainable growth and return while maintaining a retail market presence 
consequently  sales of institutional products varied from period to period 
in  deposits on institutional products declined compared to higher fixed annuity deposits in were the result of a million increase in deposits on allstate treasury linked annuity contracts 
this increase was partially offset by modest declines in deposits on traditional deferred annuities and market value adjusted annuities 
these declines were in part impacted by our actions to improve new business returns and reduced consumer demand 
consumer demand for fixed annuities is influenced by market interest rates on short term deposit products and equity market conditions  which can increase the relative attractiveness of competing investment alternatives 
surrenders and partial withdrawals decreased in compared to this decline was due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on interest sensitive life insurance policies and the classification of the net change in variable annuity contractholder funds as other adjustments subsequent to the effective date of our reinsurance agreements with prudential 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities 
the surrenders and partial withdrawals line in the table above  for includes million related to the reinsured variable annuity business 
the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life insurance products and allstate bank products  based on the beginning of period contractholder funds  was in compared to in the improvement in the surrender and partial withdrawal rate in compared to was primarily due to a block of corporate owned life insurance policies that terminated in due to the bankruptcy of the policyholder 
surrenders and partial withdrawals increased in compared to  while the surrender and partial withdrawal rate increased to for from for the increase in the surrender and partial withdrawal rate in was influenced by multiple factors  including the relatively low interest rate environment during the preceding years  which reduced reinvestment opportunities and increased the number of policies with little or no surrender charge protection 
also influencing the increase were our crediting rate strategies related to renewal business implemented to improve investment spreads on selected contracts 
net investment income increased in compared to and in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher average portfolio balances  increased portfolio yields and higher income from limited partnership interests 
the increase was due to increased portfolio yields and higher average portfolio balances 
higher average portfolio balances in both years resulted primarily from the investment of cash flows from operating activities and  in  financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities  funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies 
the higher portfolio yields in both periods were primarily due to increased yields on floating rate instruments resulting from higher short term market interest rates and improved yields on fixed rate assets supporting fixed annuities 
for certain products  the yield changes on our floating rate instruments are primarily offset by changes in crediting rates to holders of our floating rate contracts  resulting in minimal impact on net income

analysis of costs and expenses total costs and expenses in were consistent with as increased interest credited to contractholder funds and life and annuity contract benefits were offset by lower amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges 
total costs and expenses increased in compared to due to higher interest credited to contractholder funds and restructuring and related charges  partially offset by lower operating costs and expenses and life and annuity contract benefits 
life and annuity contract benefits increased or million in compared to due to increased contract benefits on life insurance products  partially offset by lower contract benefits on annuities 
increased contract benefits on life insurance products in were primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience  litigation related costs recognized in in the form of additional policy benefits on certain universal life policies written prior to  and higher contract benefits associated with the workplace division 
the decline in contract benefits on annuities was mostly attributable to favorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and the absence in of contract benefits on the reinsured variable annuity business  partially offset by an increase in the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies 
this implied interest totaled million and million in and  respectively 
life and annuity contract benefits decreased or million in compared to due to the absence in of amounts related to the loan protection business that was transferred to allstate protection beginning in and the absence in of contract benefits related to the reinsured variable annuity business in the period subsequent to the effective date of the reinsurance agreement 
excluding the impact of the loan protection business in and the reinsured variable annuity business  contract benefits increased or million in compared to due primarily to growth in business in force and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingences to million in from million in we analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums  contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies benefit spread 
the benefit spread by product group is disclosed in the following table 
in millions life insurance annuities total benefit spread interest credited to contractholder funds increased or million in compared to and or million in compared to both increases were due primarily to growth in average contractholder funds and  to a lesser extent  higher weighted average interest crediting rates on institutional products  which are detailed in the table below 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the reinsured variable annuity business 
excluding the impact of the reinsured variable annuity business  interest credited to contractholder funds increased in compared to and in compared to in order to analyze the impact of net investment income and interest credited to policyholders on net income  we review the difference between net investment income and the sum of interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies  which is included as a component of life and annuity contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations investment spread

amortization deceleration acceleration for changes in assumptions dac unlocking for includes million relating to the reinsured variable annuity business 
there was no dac unlocking related to variable annuities in the decrease in amortization of dac in compared to was due to the absence in of amortization on the reinsured variable annuity business 
excluding amortization relating to the reinsured variable annuity business  amortization of dac in was consistent with as increased amortization related to higher gross profits on fixed annuities and a decline in the credit to income for amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses were partially offset by lower amortization related to interest sensitive life insurance contracts and a favorable impact relating to our annual comprehensive review of dac assumptions commonly referred to as dac unlocking 
the decline in amortization related to interest sensitive life insurance contracts was the result of a write down in totaling million for the present value of future profits related to a block of corporate owned life insurance policies that terminated due to the bankruptcy of the policyholder 
the slight decline in amortization of dac in compared to was driven mostly by a favorable change in amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses and a reduction in amortization on our reinsured variable annuity business  almost entirely offset by the impact of higher gross profits on investment contracts and the write off in totaling million related to the block of corporate owned life insurance policies described above 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets

excluding expenses associated with the impact of the reinsured variable annuity business in the period of prior to the effective date of the reinsurance agreement  non deferrable acquisition expenses increased in compared to due to higher non deferrable commissions on certain workplace division products and other operating costs and expenses increased due to higher investment in technology 
non deferrable acquisition costs declined in compared to due primarily to the transfer of the loan protection business to allstate protection effective january  and a reduction in non deferrable commissions  which was primarily due to the reinsured variable annuity business 
non deferrable acquisition costs related to the loan protection business amounted to million in other operating costs and expenses declined million or in compared to the reinsured variable annuity business and the transfer of the loan protection business resulted in million of this reduction

reinsurance ceded we enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers to limit our risk of mortality and morbidity losses 
in addition  allstate financial has used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
as of both december  and  of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured 
as of december  and  for certain term life insurance policies  we ceded up to of the mortality risk depending on the length of the term 
additionally  we ceded substantially all of the risk associated with our variable annuity business and we cede of the morbidity risk on substantially all of our long term care contracts 
beginning in july  for new life insurance contracts  we ceded the mortality risk associated with coverage in excess of million per life for contracts issued to individuals age and over  and we ceded the mortality risk associated with coverage in excess of million per life for most other contracts 
also beginning in july  for certain large contracts that meet specific criteria  the company s retention limit was increased to million per life 
in the period prior to july  but subsequent to august  we ceded the mortality risk associated with coverage in excess of million per life  except in for certain instances when specific criteria were met  we ceded the mortality risk associated with coverage in excess of million per life 
for business sold prior to october  we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to million per individual life 
the changes in allstate financial s retention guidelines for new life insurance contracts did not have a significant impact on the results of operations in or amounts recoverable from reinsurers by type of policy or contract at december  are summarized in the following table

we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook we plan to increase sales of our financial products by allstate exclusive agencies by developing and bringing to market new innovative  consumer driven financial products and features targeted to middle market customers 
we plan to grow sales of our workplace division products and increase focus on larger employers 
sales of our institutional products will be impacted by management s assessment of market liquidity  credit spreads and other market conditions 
market conditions may also influence whether maturing contracts are replaced with new issuances 
we expect operating costs and expenses to increase over the prior year as a result of increased spending for the development of innovative products  additional marketing and growth of our allstate exclusive agency and workplace division distribution channels as well as a reduction in the variable annuity servicing fee from prudential 
we expect that these expense increases will be partially mitigated by our continuing focus on operating efficiency 
we plan to balance targeted new business return improvement with investments in growth initiatives and sales 
initially  investments in growth are expected to slow the improvement of returns and may reduce the price competitiveness of certain products  such as our fixed annuities  and slow or reduce the growth in sales and net income 
the transition of our investment objective from primarily income generation to increased focus on increasing total returns may result in increased volatility in net investment income and realized capital gains and losses from period to period 
increased allocations to alternative investment classes  such as limited partnership interests and other equity based assets  may also contribute to this volatility 
increased levels of dividends paid by allstate financial in  combined with the anticipated dividends in  may lead to a decline in invested assets and investment income 
investments overview and strategy an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over time  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
we employ a strategic asset allocation model  which considers the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
the model s recommended asset allocation  along with duration and liquidity considerations  guides our initial asset allocation 
this is further adjusted based on an analysis of other potential market opportunities available 
portfolio performance is measured against benchmarks at target allocation weights 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy has historically focused on the need for risk adjusted spread to support the underlying liabilities to achieve return on capital and profitable growth 
we believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
we believe this strategy maintains the investment spread necessary to sustain income over time 
the portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market  analytical and proprietary modeling  including a strategic asset allocation model  as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
we will be adding a total return framework to the management of allstate financial s assets to further enhance long term returns and leverage our active management capabilities 
the corporate and other portfolio s investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure 
the portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns 
in conjunction with our priority of optimizing the returns we realize for the risks we accept  we will be undertaking selected new investment strategies 
the first is exploring the adoption of an enhanced enterprise wide asset allocation model 
this model will provide opportunities for enhanced returns by considering our total liability profile rather than a more limited business unit profile 
this should allow us to capitalize on the diversification of risk within the enterprise and to invest in a broader and more global array of asset types 
this shift in strategy will improve overall returns for the same level of portfolio risk being assumed today  although it may result in a different mix of assets held in the business segments 
we are also forming investment subsidiaries  one within allstate financial and the other within corporate and other  to pursue investment opportunities not efficiently held within our insurance operations 
the creation of these subsidiaries improves our capital management by enabling higher return investment strategies 
as a result of these strategies and enterprise asset allocation  there may be a different mix in the reporting of returns between investment income  realized capital gains and losses  unrealized capital gains and losses and higher investment expenses 
additionally  these strategies may result in increased leverage from investing activities 
as a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios  we may sell securities during a period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
portfolio monitoring  which includes identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing other than temporary impairments on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery  are conducted regularly

cost basis for these securities was billion and million for property liability and allstate financial  respectively 
balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between allstate financial and corporate and other 
total investments decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income and equity securities and lower funds associated with collateral received in conjunction with securities lending and other activities  partially offset by positive cash flows from operating activities 
the property liability investment portfolio decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to dividends paid by aic to the allstate corporation and decreased net unrealized gains on equity and fixed income securities  partially offset by positive cash flows from operating activities and the repayment of a million intercompany note by alic to its parent  aic 
the allstate financial investment portfolio decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities  the payment of dividends to aic  the repayment of alic s intercompany note to its parent  aic  and lower funds associated with collateral received in conjunction with securities lending and other activities  partially offset by positive cash flows from operating activities 
the corporate and other investment portfolio increased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to dividends received from aic and the proceeds from the billion of junior subordinated securities issued in may  partially offset by cash flows used in financing activities 
total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending business activities  funds received in connection with securities repurchase agreements and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  as of december  and  these investments were carried at fair value and classified in fixed income securities totaling billion and billion  respectively  and short term investments totaling million and billion  respectively 
securities lending activities are primarily used as an investment yield enhancement  and are conducted with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral  typically in the form of cash  in an amount generally equal to to of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability to return the collateral is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
fixed income securities see note of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost  unrealized gains  unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income security for the years ended december  and the following table shows fixed income securities by type at december fair value in millions us government and agencies   municipal   corporate   foreign government   mortgage backed securities   commercial mortgage backed securities   asset backed securities   redeemable preferred stock total fixed income securities   during  certain financial markets experienced decreased liquidity 
this was particularly evident in the markets for securities collateralized by sub prime residential mortgages 
we experienced this illiquidity particularly in our asset backed residential mortgage backed securities abs rmbs  asset backed collateralized debt obligations abs cdos  alt a residential mortgage backed securities alt a and commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations cre cdo portfolios 
these portfolios totaled billion or less than of our total investments at december  certain other asset backed and real estate backed securities markets experienced illiquidity  but to a lesser degree 
the fair values of securities comprising the illiquid portfolios are obtained from our contracted third party pricing servicers and brokers 
we evaluated the reasonableness of the fair value of these portfolios as of december  by comparing vendor prices to alternative third party pricing and valuation servicers  both of which consider available market information including  but not limited to  collateral quality  anticipated cash flows  credit enhancements  default rates  loss severities  and credit ratings from rating agencies 
in addition  we also considered the reasonableness of security values based upon the securities relative position within their respective capital structures in determining the reasonableness of fair values  on a portfolio basis  for the above referenced securities as of december  municipal bonds  including tax exempt and taxable securities  totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  as of december   approximately billion or of our municipal bond portfolio is insured by eight bond insurers and have a moody s equivalent rating of aaa or aa 
our practices for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds primarily take into consideration the quality of the underlying security 
as of december   we believe that the valuations already reflect a significant decline in the value of the insurance  and further such declines if any  are not expected to be material 
while the valuation of these holdings may be temporarily impacted by negative market developments  we continue to have the intent and ability to hold the bonds and expect to receive all of the contractual cash flows 
as of december   of our insured municipal bond portfolio was insured by mbia  by ambac  by fsa and by fgic 
in total  we hold billion of fixed income securities that are insured by bond insurers  including million of our abs rmbs and million of our other asset backed securities discussed below 
additionally  we hold million of corporate bonds that were directly issued by these bond insurers 
included in our municipal bond portfolio at december  are billion of auction rate securities ars that have long term stated maturities  with the interest rate reset based on auctions every  or days depending on the specific security 
at the auction date  if the quantity of sell orders exceeds the quantity of purchase orders  the auction fails and the issuers are forced to pay a maximum rate as defined for each issue 
the maximum rate is designed so that its prolonged use is an incentive to the issuer to call and refinance the long term bonds 
the effect of this incentive may be lessened to the extent that the maximum rate is closer to current market rates 
when auctions are successfully completed  the interest rate reset normally corresponds with the short term rate associated with the reset period 
our holdings primarily have a moody s equivalent rating of aaa and fair value was estimated at the corresponding par value at december  we make our investment decisions based on the underlying credit of each security  which for approximately of our holdings are pools of student loans for which at least of the collateral is insured by the us department of education 
during february of  dealers were no longer supporting auctions with their own bids as they had in the past and we experienced failed auctions for billion of our ars holdings for which we are currently receiving the maximum rate 
the entire ars portfolio will come up for auction in march we anticipate that failed auctions may persist and more of our holdings will reset at the maximum rate 
auctions will continue to be conducted as scheduled for each of the securities 
while these developments continue in the market  par value of these holdings may not be representative of the fair value of these securities 
accordingly  subsequent auctions could be more successful resulting in interest rates being more in line with the  or day reset periods 
corporate bonds totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  as of december   billion  or of the portfolio consisted of privately placed securities compared to billion or at december  privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are in unregistered form and are directly negotiated with the borrower 
all privately placed corporate securities are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic based on information provided to them and are also internally rated 
additionally  approximately of the privately placed corporate securities in our portfolio are rated by an independent rating agency

the portfolio is made up of approximately issues with an average security value of approximately million 
privately placed corporate obligations generally benefit from increased yields and structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities 
additionally  investments in these securities are made after extensive due diligence of the issuer  typically including direct discussions with senior management and on site visits to company facilities 
ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position 
every issue is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation once a year 
hybrid securities are carried at fair value and total billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
for further discussion on hybrid securities  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign government securities totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  mortgage backed securities mbs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  the credit risk associated with mbs is mitigated due to the fact that of the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities us agency 
the mbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages

at december   the alt a portfolio had net unrealized losses of million  which were comprised of million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
billion or of these securities were issued during  and we hold million of alt a securities acquired during  which were rated aaa by one or more rating agencies at the time of purchase 
commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  approximately of the cmbs investments are pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area 
the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike other structured products  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages  whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments 
the following table shows cmbs by type and moody s equivalent rating at december  in millions fair value to total investments aaa aa a baa cmbs  cre cdo total cmbs  cre cdo are investments secured primarily by commercial mortgage backed securities and other commercial mortgage debt obligations

at december   cre cdos had net unrealized losses of million  which were comprised of million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
in addition to the quality of the loans and securities collateralizing the cre cdos  influential factors in our analysis are the adequacy of subordination and strength of the cre cdo management team 
asset backed securities abs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral 
in addition  many of the securities in the abs portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization  subordinated structures  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
a portion of the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since  for example  price volatility and ultimate realized yields are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets

during  three second lien abs rmbs with a value of million were downgraded within the investment grade ratings 
four second lien securities with a fair value of million were downgraded from investment grade to below investment grade ratings 
during  we sold million of abs rmbs  recognizing a loss of million 
we also collected million of principal repayments consistent with the expected cash flows 
these repayments represent approximately of the amortized cost of our outstanding portfolio at december  abs cdos are securities collateralized by a variety of residential mortgage backed and other securities  which may include sub prime rmbs 
fair value represents of the amortized cost of these securities 
as of december   this portfolio had net unrealized losses of million 
writedowns during were recorded on our abs rmbs and abs cdos totaling million and million  respectively 
we did not record any write downs related to our alt as or cre cdos 
we continue to believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily predictive of the performance of the underlying collateral 
in the absence of further deterioration in the collateral relative to our positions in the securities respective capital structures  which could require other than temporary impairments  the unrealized losses should reverse over the remaining lives of the securities 
other collateralized debt obligations totaled billion and are rated investment grade at december  other collateralized debt obligations consist primarily of obligations secured by high yield and investment grade corporate credits including billion of collateralized loan obligations  million of synthetic cdos  million of primarily bank trust preferred cdos  million of market value cdos  million of cdos that invest in other cdos cdo squared  and million of collateralized bond obligations 
the cdo squared holdings contain immaterial amounts of abs cdos  ranging up to of the underlying collateral 
the cash flows used to pay principle and interest are derived from the other cdo s collateral except for synthetic cdos which rely on cash flows from the underlying credit default swaps 
as of december   net unrealized losses on the other collateralized debt obligations was million 
other asset backed securities consist primarily of investments secured by portfolios of credit card loans  auto loans  student loans and other consumer and corporate obligations 
as of december   the net unrealized losses on these securities was million 
additionally  of the other asset backed securities that are rated aaa were insured by five bond insurers 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments to help manage the exposure to interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent currency and credit risks  from the fixed income securities portfolio

geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our exposure 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risks  are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status when and if necessary 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by a market based expected rate of return 
we had no realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the years ended december   and limited partnership interests limited partnership interests totaled billion  or of total investments  at december  limited partnership interests primarily have exposure to private equity  real estate and hedge funds 
this balance has increased since december  of the limited partnership interests held at december   were accounted for under the equity method of accounting  the remaining were carried at cost 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year 
other investments our other investments are comprised primarily of billion of bank loans and billion of policy loans 
bank loans are comprised primarily of senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost 
policy loans are carried at the unpaid principal balances 
unrealized gains and losses see note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining whether securities are other than temporarily impaired 
the unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at december  totaled billion  a decrease of billion since december  the decrease in net unrealized net capital gains was related primarily to increased unrealized losses on investment grade fixed income securities  resulting from widening credit spreads and credit exposure related to collateralized securities  which more than offset the effects of declining interest rates and sales of equity securities with net realized gains totaling billion 
credit spreads are the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate typically defined as the yield on us treasury securities  that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit  liquidity and or repayment risks for fixed income securities with consistent terms 
credit spreads vary with the market s perception of risk and liquidity in specific fixed income markets 
credit spreads can widen increase or tighten decrease and may offset or add to the effects of risk free interest rate changes in the valuation of fixed income securities from period to period 
gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector are provided in the table below

as of december   million or of the gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and billion or of the gross unrealized losses in the remaining fixed income securities related to securities rated investment grade 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to rising interest rates or changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value are other than temporary

due to lags between the funding of an investment  execution of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office svo of the naic  and rating by the svo  we generally have a small number of securities that have a pending rating 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in credit spreads  which reflect liquidity conditions of the related markets  since the securities were acquired 
of the unrealized losses on below investment grade securities  there were no significant unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities rated below investment grade are high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities  through diversification of the portfolio  active credit monitoring and portfolio management

at december   the financial services  consumer goods and banking sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio  which were company and sector specific 
we expect the eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value are potentially other than temporary 
we use several methodologies to estimate the fair value of fixed income and equity securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts 
for a discussion of these methods  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate  on a case by case basis  fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify situations where the fair value  compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities  and cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery as a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments for reasons such as changes in duration  revisions to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  as well as certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers 
all investments in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value were other than temporary

the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
categories iii and iv have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific  or issuer specific conditions 
all of the securities in these categories are monitored for other than temporary impairment 
we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time 
whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate

problem fixed income securities and bank loans are in default with respect to principal or interest and or are investments issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition or loan 
restructured fixed income and bank loan investments have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring 
potential problem fixed income or bank loan investments are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest  which causes us to believe these investments may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities and bank loans at december in millions amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income and bank loan portfolios amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income and bank loan portfolios problem restructured potential problem total net carrying value cumulative write downs recognized cumulative write downs recognized only reflects write downs related to investments within the problem  potential problem and restructured categories 
we have experienced a decrease in the amortized cost of investments categorized as problem and an increase in the amortized cost of investments categorized potential problem as of december  compared to december  the decrease in the problem category was primarily due to dispositions  including the pay off of certain airline related investments 
the increase in the potential problem category was primarily due to the addition of certain abs cdos  as well as a corporate bond issued by a prime mortgage lender 
we evaluated each of these investments through our portfolio monitoring process at december  and recorded write downs when appropriate 
we further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these investments were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until recovery 
while these balances may increase in the future  particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable  management expects that the total amount of investments in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities and bank loans portfolios

dispositions in included net realized gains on sales and other transactions such as calls and prepayments of billion and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of million 
the net realized gains on sales and other transactions were primarily due to net realized gains on equity securities of billion comprised of gross gains of billion and gross losses of million 
the gross gains were attributable to our continuing tactical reallocation of equity securities in the property liability portfolio 
dispositions in included net realized gains on sales and other transactions such as calls and prepayments of million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of million 
the net realized gains on sales and other transactions were comprised of gross gains of million and gross losses of million 
the million in gross losses primarily consisted of million from sales of fixed income securities and million from sales of equity securities 
during our comprehensive portfolio reviews  we determine whether there are any approved programs involving the expected disposition of investments such as changes in duration  revisions to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  as well as dispositions anticipated by the portfolio managers resulting from their on going comprehensive reviews of the portfolios 
upon approval of such programs  portfolio managers identify a population of suitable investments  typically larger than needed to accomplish the objective  from which specific securities are selected to sell 
due to our change in intent to hold until recovery  we recognize impairments on investments within the population that are in an unrealized loss position 
when the objectives of the programs are accomplished  any remaining securities are redesignated as intent to hold until recovery 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of losses related to a change in our intent to hold certain investments with unrealized losses in the property liability and allstate financial segments until they recover in value 
the change in our intent was primarily related to strategic asset allocation decisions and ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios as well as a liquidity strategy in the property liability portfolio 
at december   the fair value of securities for which we did not have the intent to hold until recovery totaled billion 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of losses related to a change in our intent to hold certain securities with unrealized losses until they recover in value 
the change in our intent was driven by certain approved programs  including funding for the disposition through reinsurance of substantially all of allstate financial s variable annuity business  yield enhancement strategies for allstate financial  a liquidity strategy review for corporate and other segment  changes to strategic asset allocations for property liability and ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios 
these programs were completed during at december   the fair value of securities for which we did not have the intent to hold until recovery totaled million

the changes in valuation of the embedded derivatives are reported in realized capital gains and losses 
the results generally track the performance of underlying equity indices 
valuation gains and losses would be converted into cash for convertible securities upon our conversion or sale of these securities but will be eliminated if held to maturity  for equity indexed notes upon sale or maturity 
credit exposure asset replication credit default swaps used to replicate fixed income securities to complement the cash market when credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or when the derivative alternative is less expensive than the cash market alternative 
the amounts primarily reflect non cash changes in valuation due to fluctuating credit spreads  which would be converted to cash upon termination or a default on an underlying credit obligation

the amounts were primarily cash settlements and reflect returns on the underlying index 
we have no holdings outstanding at december  currency exposure foreign currency contracts other other a changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view 
tactical duration management is accomplished through both cash market transactions including new purchases and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation as shown in the market risk section of the md a 
approximately million or of the losses relate to the valuations of derivative instruments are associated with economic hedging instruments that support investments whose valuation changes are reported in shareholders equity 
the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million with the largest loss being million and the smallest loss being million 
the one security comprising the million was in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of less than six consecutive months 
our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates  and issue for government securities

the circumstances of the above losses are considered to be security specific or issue specific and are not expected to have a material effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market or market segment  or to changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and or risk tolerance 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview we generate substantial investible funds from our property liability and allstate financial businesses 
in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration and value at risk limits  simulation  and as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios  and as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration results in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial s product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issue interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key benchmarks as well as changes in interest rates resulting from the widening credit spreads and credit exposure to collateralized securities 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset with a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap is attributable to the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable spreads across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels 
this philosophy is executed using interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps  floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for over the counter derivative transactions including interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floor agreements  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements  and when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we held cash of million and securities of million pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments  we pledged cash of million and securities of million as collateral to counterparties 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
the preceding assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately billion  compared to billion at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets  as well as a program that uses interest rate swaptions to manage the risk of a large rate increase 
in calculating the impact of a basis point increase on the swaption value  we have assumed interest rate volatility remains constant 
based on the short futures and swaption contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments 
these assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has increased from the billion reported at december  due to an increase in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership funds  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to approximately billion and billion  respectively  at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  additionally  we had contracts in short standard poor s composite price index s p futures at december  with a fair value of million 
at december   our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the s p based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p increases or decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by approximately  respectively 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of these investments to monthly total returns of the s p over a three year historical period 
since beta is historically based  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks and the composition of our portfolio will not change in the future 
therefore  the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and or income benefits provided by our variable products 
in  we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through a reinsurance agreement with prudential as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk 
equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits 
total variable life contract charges for and were million and million  respectively 
separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were and million in december  and  respectively 
at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the risk associated with these liabilities using equity indexed options and futures  interest rate swaps  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and our canadian operations 
we also have certain funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  however  derivatives are used to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and of approximately half the securities 
at december  and  we had approximately million and billion  respectively  in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities  an additional million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries  and million in unhedged non dollar pay fixed income securities 
these amounts were million  million  and million  respectively  at december  approximately of the foreign currency exposure is in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across currencies  compared to currencies at december  our largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
the largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
commodity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the prices of commodities 
this risk arises from our commodity linked investments  such as the goldman sachs commodity index which is a broad based  oil dominated index 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million exposure to the index  respectively 
this exposure was almost entirely within property liability 
based upon the information and assumptions available at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change to the commodity index would decrease the value of our commodity investments by million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in commodity prices should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time 
any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans 
we report the net funded status of our pension and other postretirement plans in the consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholder s equity 
it represents the differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost 
the measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below 
the net underfunded status of the pension and other post retirement benefit obligation at december  was million  a decrease of million from billion at december  as of december   each of our qualified pension plans had net assets that exceeded its projected benefit obligation  based on an october  measurement date  although as of january   the fair value of plan assets had declined to the extent that certain plans projected benefit obligations slightly exceeded plan assets 
as provided for in the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions 
net periodic pension cost decreased in principally due to lower settlement charges and decreases in the amortization of actuarial losses 
net periodic pension cost increased in principally due to higher settlement charges  an increase in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates and the amortization of actuarial losses 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents and in due to higher lump sum payments made to allstate employees 
additional settlement charges occurred during also related to the supplemental retirement income plan srip as a result of lump sum payments made from the plan 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
amounts recorded for pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by standard poor s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the net funded status liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income after tax as of january   our remeasurement date to transition to a december measurement date under sfas no 
 versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the net funded status liability as of october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the net funded status liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income after tax by million as of january   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the net funded status liability as of october  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in results of operations in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at january   compared to million at october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at january   compared to million at october  capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our capital resources at december in millions common stock  retained income and other shareholders equity items accumulated other comprehensive income  total shareholders equity    debt    total capital resources    ratio of debt to shareholders equity ratio of debt to capital resources shareholders equity increased in  due to net income and a decline in the net underfunded status of the pension and other post retirement benefit obligation  partially offset by share repurchases  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders 
shareholders equity increased in  due to net income which was partially offset by share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments  and the recognition of the net funded status of pension and other post retirement benefit obligations recognized with the adoption of sfas no 
for further information on sfas no 
 see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
the decline in the net underfunded status of the pension and other post retirement benefit obligation in is primarily related to favorable investment performance of the assets and an increase in the discount rate of the pension plans  and lower than assumed claims experience in the other post retirement employee benefit plans 
the favorable impact on shareholders equity was million for pension  and million for other post employment benefits opeb

we have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in new jersey and florida that maintain separate group ratings 
the ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group 
many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency 
allstate new jersey insurance company and encompass insurance company of new jersey  which write auto and homeowners insurance  are rated a by am best 
allstate new jersey insurance company also has a demotech rating of a 
allstate floridian  which writes primarily property insurance  has an am best rating of b with a negative outlook 
this rating is in part dependent upon the catastrophe exposure reduction provided by our catastrophe reinsurance program in florida 
we expect to place this program for the hurricane season later this year 
afic and its subsidiary  allstate floridian indemnity company  also have demotech financial stability ratings of a 
encompass floridian insurance company and encompass floridian indemnity company  both subsidiaries of afic  have demotech financial stability ratings of a 
allstate s domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile 
statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity  operating leverage and premium growth capacity  and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings 
as of december   aic s statutory surplus is approximately billion compared to billion at december  the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges

property liability cash provided by operating activities for property liability in was comparable to lower cash provided by operating activities for property liability in  compared to  was primarily due to higher claim payments related to the prior year hurricanes  partially offset by increased premiums 
cash flows provided by investing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales of equity securities

cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by aic to its parent  the allstate corporation  totaling billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
during  aic will have the capacity to pay a total of billion in dividends without obtaining prior approval from the illinois department of insurance 
for a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
allstate financial higher operating cash flows for allstate financial in  compared to  primarily related to lower operating expenses and tax payments  an increase in investment income  partially offset by increased policy and contract benefit payments and the absence in of contract charges on the reinsured variable annuity business 
higher operating cash flows for allstate financial in  compared to  primarily related to higher investment income 
cash flows from investing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by increased cash used in financing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased in primarily due to decreased net cash provided by financing activities  partially offset by the investment of higher operating cash flows 
cash flows used in investing activities in also include the settlements related to the disposition through reinsurance of substantially all our variable annuity business 
cash flows used in financing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to lower contractholder fund deposits 
cash used in financing activities increased in as a result of lower contractholder fund deposits and higher surrenders and partial withdrawals 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
financing cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by allstate financial totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a portion of the allstate financial product portfolio  including fixed annuity  interest sensitive life insurance and certain funding agreements  is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders 
the following table summarizes allstate financial s liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal  subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges  market value  subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments  total contractholder funds  includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
approximately billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment including approximately billion with a period commencing during includes billion of extendible funding agreements backing medium term notes outstanding with an initial maturity of months from the effective date of the contract that require contractholders to elect a maturity extension each month for a period of to years  depending on the contract terms  up to the contractually specified final maturity date 
the contractually specified final maturity dates begin in and are definitive unless the maturity dates are accelerated in accordance with the contractholders election to not extend the maturity date  in which case the contracts mature months thereafter 
the contracts have an annual coupon step up feature when extended 
based upon the elections made as of december   approximately billion will mature during in addition  from january  through february   approximately million elected to not extend the initial maturity date 
includes approximately billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to prudential effective june  to ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment  we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios 
depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions  allstate financial s cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods 
allstate financial expects to meet the cash flow requirements of the non extended funding agreements maturing in and primarily through a combination of cash received from new product deposits and contractual interest and principal receipts from our investment portfolio 
corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to investments in the portfolios of kennett capital holdings  llc kennett capital holdings 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
higher cash used in investing activities in  when compared to  was the result of increased dividends from subsidiaries to the holding company 
higher cash used in financing activities in  when compared to  was the result of increased share repurchases 
we have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program  lines of credit  dollar rolls and repurchase agreements 
in the aggregate  at december   these sources could provide over billion of additional liquidity 
for additional liquidity  we can also issue new insurance contracts  incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio 
the liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment 
for example  billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  and billion of mortgage loans that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments  such as our us government and agencies  municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios 
the sources of liquidity for the allstate corporation include but are not limited to dividends from aic and billion of consolidated investments of kennett capital holdings at december  we have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was billion  however  the outstanding balance fluctuates daily 
our primary credit facility covers short term liquidity requirements 
our billion unsecured revolving credit facility  has an initial term of five years expiring in with two one year extensions that can be exercised in the first or second year of the facility upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two thirds of the commitments to lend 
this facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional million of borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility 
a universal shelf registration statement was filed with the sec in may we can use it to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities  common stock including million shares of treasury stock as of december   preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and securities of subsidiaries 
the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 
our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease vie obligations 
the covenant requires that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements 
this ratio at december  was 
for quantification of the synthetic lease vie obligations  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation  the business segments and investments 
allstate financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its alm organization  using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity from components of the investment portfolio  as appropriate  and is routinely subjected to stress testing 
allstate protection s underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity  which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses 
discontinued lines and coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk 
property liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities  including short term investments  exchange traded common stock  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows 
allstate financial and property liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program through the participation of aic and alic  and allstate financial has access to funds from the aic and alic intercompany liquidity agreement 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below aa aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements  contractholder funds     reserve for life contingent contract benefits   long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans   reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses   net unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations    liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business  including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies 
these amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract 
extendible funding agreements backing medium term notes outstanding are reflected in the table above at the contractually specified first maturity dates or the maturity date accelerated in accordance with the contractholders election to not extend the initial maturity date 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life  fixed deferred annuities  traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of billion for contractholder funds and billion for reserve for life contingent contract benefits as included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension and opeb contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
the pension plans obligations in the next months represent our planned contributions  and the remaining years contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans 
the opeb plans obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid 
these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for ibnr claims 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are our best estimates 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred tax liabilities netted in the net deferred tax asset of million 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
net unrecognized tax benefits relates to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the fin liability balance will be reduced by million within the next months with the resolution of an outstanding issue resulting from the internal revenue service examination of the and tax years 
the resolution of this obligation may be for an amount less than what we have accrued 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional   total commitments   contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements  private equities and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

enterprise risk management allstate has been working on enterprise risk management erm for six years  establishing processes and infrastructure to effectively manage risk within our tolerances while optimizing returns 
we have a senior management advisory committee called the enterprise risk return council errc which is responsible for overseeing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within allstate 
enterprise risk management is a disciplined  holistic  and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which provides additional insight when setting strategy across the allstate enterprise identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on allstate manages risk and proactively optimizes our overall profile consistent with allstate s risk appetite provides greater assurance of achieving allstate s objectives allows allstate to pursue a return commensurate with the risks taken risk management is primarily executed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken 
effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate governance policies  stochastic modeling software  tolerances and limits  consistent risk management practices  which include risk identification  evaluation  prioritization  treatment and monitoring  and effective communication and reporting 
managers in the various business units are responsible for managing  measuring  evaluating  and reporting risks as appropriate in their respective areas within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise 
this would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe  managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk  duration and convexity metrics  and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement 
as appropriate  consistent enterprise wide measurement standards and limits are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning  capital management  and enterprise risk reporting 
business unit measures and practices are aligned with the overall enterprise standards 
for the enterprise  we are utilizing an internally developed enterprise stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed  given a defined tolerance for risk 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our various businesses 
economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses and various risks 
these capabilities allow us to view risk and return decisions holistically which may provide opportunities for enhanced returns to shareholders at similar or lower levels of risk than might be achieved if this modeling were to be only applied at the business unit level 
areas we are pursuing that may provide such opportunities include an enterprise strategic asset allocation in our investment portfolio  more emphasis on total return economics in addition to traditional net credit spreads  and the creation of investment subsidiaries to pursue opportunistic investments outside the invested assets typically utilized in our insurance operations 
we have established an internal capital support agreement between certain legal entities to more fully capitalize on diversification benefits within the enterprise 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them
