our customers are primarily small to mid sized businesses who require temporary blue collar staffing 
annually  we serve more than  customers and put approximately  people to work through our brands 
during we took the following actions corporate name change 
in december we changed our name from labor ready  inc to trueblue  inc 
the name change reflects our vision to be the leading provider of blue collar staffing with multiple brands serving the temporary staffing industry 
share purchases 
during we purchased million shares of our common stock for million  including commissions 
at the end of  we had million available to us to purchase shares of our common stock under the current authorization

branch openings and closures 
during less favorable economic conditions  we tend to reduce branch openings and increase the number of branch closings 
we believe this type of flexibility and discipline improves the overall return for our investors 
during  we opened new branches and closed branches 
revenue for was billion  an increase of over the prior year 
net income decreased to million  or per diluted share 
the revenues were higher primarily as a result of revenue growth from acquired branches 
gross profit decreased slightly during gross profit was of revenue in compared to of revenue during lower workers compensation expense was offset by an increase in wages paid to temporary workers and pricing pressure 
the improvement in workers compensation expense is primarily due to improvements in accident prevention and risk management 
the increase in wages paid to our temporary workers was heavily driven by numerous statutory minimum wage increases 
while we have increased the bill rates to our customers for these pay increases  we have not yet fully passed through the amount of our standard markup due to an increased level of price sensitivity with our customers associated with slower economic conditions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to of revenue for compared to of revenue during sg a expense was higher during due to lease termination and other costs related to closing branches  transition and integration costs related to acquisitions  sales development expenses  and decrease in same store branch revenue coupled with general increases in our cost structure 
page net income was million during  or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share for other items affecting net income and net income per diluted share not discussed above include a lower income tax expense during and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding at the end of as compared to our effective tax rate was lower than our rate due to the retroactive renewal of certain tax credits and favorable resolution of other income tax matters during the fourth quarter of we also undertook a significant share purchase effort in by purchasing million of our common stock  including commissions 
these purchases have resulted in lower weighted average shares outstanding at the end of as compared to since the beginning of we have purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  including commissions

revenue from our international operations for was approximately of our total revenue compared to and  respectively  for and gross profit 
gross profit was of revenue for compared to and for and  respectively 
workers compensation costs for were approximately of revenue compared to of revenue for the improvement in workers compensation expense is due primarily to the success of our accident prevention and risk management programs that have been implemented over several years 
the decrease in workers compensation costs was partially offset by an increase in wages paid to temporary workers 
there were state minimum wage increases during as well as increases in canada and the united kingdom 
while we have increased the bill rates to our customers for these pay increases  we have not yet fully passed through our standard markup due to an increased level of price sensitivity page with our customers associated with slower economic conditions 
as a result  our average pay rate increased while our average bill rate increased 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was due to the reduction to our workers compensation costs as a result of safety and risk management programs reducing the frequency and severity of accidents 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses were of revenue for and and of revenue for and  respectively 
the increase during was primarily attributable to four factors lease termination and other costs related to closing branches 
during we closed branches  transition and integration costs related to acquisitions  sales development expenses  and decrease in same store branch revenue coupled with general increases in our cost structure 
the increase in sg a expenses during compared to was primarily attributable to three factors increased stock based compensation related to the adoption of sfas r and an increase in restricted stock expense 
effective december   the first day of our fiscal year  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  the mix of the new branch openings during clp and spartan brands comprised the majority of new branch openings 
these brands have a higher initial cost structure  longer break even period and ultimately a higher average branch revenue than the labor ready brand  and the increase to our sales and safety teams 
we added sales resources to generate revenue growth and safety personnel to reduce accident rates 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million and million for and  respectively 
the increase during was primarily due to depreciation of our investments in technology and increased amortization of intangibles as a result of the ssc and planetechs acquisitions 
the increase during as compared to was primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization on acquired clp assets 
interest and other income  net 
we recorded net interest and other income of million for compared to million for and million for during we have used cash to purchase our common stock and for the acquisition of ssc and planetechs which has resulted in a decrease in the amount of cash available for investment 
the increase during compared to was attributable to increasing average cash and restricted cash balances  the rise in short term interest rates  and increased rates of return on our restricted cash 
in we also recorded interest expense for our convertible subordinated notes that we redeemed in the second quarter of income tax 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state income taxes  federal tax credits  tax exempt interest income  and certain non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate was lower than our and rates due to the retroactive renewal of certain tax credits and favorable resolution of other income tax matters during the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
page cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities were as follows in thousands net income    depreciation and amortization    provision for doubtful accounts    stock based compensation    excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  deferred income taxes   tax benefit on stock options  other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities  exclusive of businesses acquired    net cash provided by operating activities   over the past three years  cash from operations provided approximately million stock based compensation increased starting in primarily due to the expensing of stock options in accordance with our adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r also changed our reporting of tax benefits on stock options in the statement of cash flows 
we now report on the line excess tax benefit from stock based compensation the gross increases in the pool of windfall tax benefits as a cash outflow for operating activities and a cash inflow for financing activities 
we are no longer required to report tax benefits from stock options on an individual line 
the change in deferred taxes during is due to increases in deferred tax assets related to the increases in the workers compensation reserve  reserves related to branch closures and contingencies that are not deductible until paid 
cash flows from investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities were as follows in thousands capital expenditures    purchases of marketable securities   maturities of marketable securities    acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired  change in restricted cash    other net cash used in investing activities   capital expenditures in and included work associated in upgrading information technology projects and leasehold improvements 
during capital expenditures also included costs related to the upgrade of security systems 
work on information technology projects will continue in we anticipate that total capital expenditures will be approximately million in we had net maturities of marketable securities in and and net purchases of marketable securities in net maturities of marketable securities were higher in as funds that would have been used to purchase additional marketable securities were used to fund share purchases and the acquisitions of ssc and planetechs 
we had net purchases of marketable securities in as we did not purchase our common stock in as we did in and during april we purchased ssc  a privately held skilled construction trades staffing provider for million 
during december we purchased substantially all of the assets of planetechs  a leading provider of aircraft maintenance staffing for million 
the change in restricted cash was higher in compared to due to a decrease in the collateral requirements for our workers compensation program 
the change in restricted cash for was primarily the result of providing page additional workers compensation collateral associated with the purchase of clp as well as for our ongoing worker s compensation program 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows used in provided by financing activities were as follows in thousands purchases and retirement of common stock   net proceeds from sale of stock through options and employee benefit plans    excess benefits from stock based compensation   payments on debt   net cash used in provided by financing activities  we purchased and retired million and million shares of our common stock in and  respectively 
capital resources we have an million credit agreement with certain unaffiliated financial institutions the revolving credit facility that expires in november the revolving credit facility  which is secured by substantially all our assets except our real estate  provides us with access to loan advances and letters of credit 
the amounts we may borrow our borrowing capacity under this agreement are largely a function of the levels of our accounts receivable from time to time  supplemented by pledged collateral 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we pay a variable rate of interest based on a margin above libor for borrowings and a variable unused commitment fee  both based on a consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda 
fees for letters of credit are based on the margin in effect plus a fee of 
as of december   our margin was and our unused capacity fee was 
at december  we had million of letters of credit issued against that borrowing capacity leaving us with million available for future borrowings 
the revolving credit facility requires that we comply with certain financial covenants 
among other things  these covenants require us to maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary  workers assurance of hawaii  inc our workers assurance program  that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments for our workers compensation collateral 
these instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash held in trusts as well as cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
at december  we had restricted cash in our workers assurance program totaling million 
of this cash  million was committed to insurance carriers leaving million available for future needs 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  is cash held within branch cash dispensing machines cdms for payment of temporary payrolls in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
workers compensation collateral and claims reserves we provide workers compensation insurance for our temporary and permanent employees 
our workers compensation insurance policies must be renewed annually 
our current coverage with american international group  inc aig is for occurrences during the period from july to july while we have primary responsibility for all claims  our insurance coverage provides reimbursement for certain losses and expenses beyond the deductible limits 
for workers compensation claims originating in self insured states  the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
furthermore  we have full liability for all further payments on claims which originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december we are required by our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation with cash and cash backed instruments  irrevocable letters of credit  or surety page bonds 
in connection with the renewal of our policy  insurance carriers annually assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
the amount of collateral that our insurance carrier required us to post for our annual renewal at july  was substantially less than the previous year 
to the extent that our insurance carrier s initial requirement was underestimated  we could be required to post substantially more collateral in the future 
at december  and december  we had provided our insurance carriers and certain states with commitments in the form and amounts outlined below in millions workers compensation commitments as of december  december  workers assurance program letters of credit surety bonds other cash backed instruments total collateral commitments we have agreements with certain financial institutions through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary  workers assurance of hawaii  inc our workers assurance program  that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments for our workers compensation collateral 
our workers assurance program cash and cash backed instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash held in trusts and cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
the fees related to those instruments subject to an annual fee were approximately as of december  our surety bonds are issued by independent insurance companies on our behalf and bear annual fees based on a percentage of the bond  which is determined by each independent surety carrier  but do not exceed of the bond amount  subject to a minimum charge 
the terms of these bonds are subject to review and renewal every one to four years and most bonds can be canceled by the sureties with as little as days notice 
we had million and million of restricted cash collateralizing our surety bonds at december  and december   respectively 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our collateral commitments to our workers compensation reserve as of the period end dates presented in millions december  december  ending workers compensation reserve discount on reserves timing of collateral release with prior providers collateral posted with current provider in comparison to obligation incurred discounted reserves for claims above our deductible total collateral commitments our total collateral commitments differ from our workers compensation reserve due to several factors including the following which are reconciled above our claims reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value while our collateral commitments are based on the gross  undiscounted reserve  a delay in the release of collateral posted with prior insurance companies for claims that have been previously paid and  therefore  are no longer reflected in the reserve  collateral posted with the current insurance carrier and various state entities in comparison to the estimated balance of unpaid claims which can be influenced by their perception of our credit risk  and our workers compensation reserves include not only estimated expenses for claims within our deductible layer but also estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits excess claims 
page generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as temporary labor services are provided and decreases as payments are made on these claims 
although the estimated claims are expensed as incurred  the claim payments are made over weighted average periods ranging from to years 
collateral for our workers compensation program is posted with various state workers compensation programs and insurance carriers based upon their assessments of our potential liabilities 
due to the timing difference between the recognition of expense and claim payments as described above  we generally anticipate that both our reserves and our collateral obligations will continue to grow 
our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  as well as those that have been incurred but not reported 
throughout the year  management reviews and evaluates the adequacy of reserves for prior periods on a quarterly basis in conjunction with an independent actuarial assessment 
we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
adjustments to prior period reserves are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which the estimate changes 
our claims reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns of risk free us treasury instruments with maturities comparable to the weighted average lives of our workers compensation claims 
at december  our reserves are discounted at rates ranging from to 
our workers compensation reserves include not only estimated expenses for claims within our deductible layer but also estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits excess claims 
we record an estimated receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount this receivable to its estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the weighted average lives of our excess claims 
the weighted average claim lives are actuarially determined 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
factors we consider in establishing and adjusting these reserves include the estimates provided by our independent actuaries  appropriate discount rates and estimated payment patterns 
factors that have caused our estimated losses for prior years to change include  among other things  inflation of medical and indemnity costs at a rate higher than originally anticipated  regulatory and legislative developments that have increased benefits and settlement requirements in several states  a different mix of business than previously anticipated  the impact of safety initiatives implemented  and positive or adverse development of claim reserves

contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of the end of payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total through through and later capital lease obligations a operating leases b purchase obligations c other obligations d total contractual cash obligations a primarily payments on computer equipment and technology commitments

page summary of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation reserves 
we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates are impacted by items that have been reported but not settled and items that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate this allowance regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and various intangible assets at their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values of the acquired indefinite lived intangible assets are based on our expectations regarding future operating results and cash flows 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets is classified as goodwill and is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
fair value for purposes of our impairment test is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
such analysis requires the use of certain future market assumptions and discount factors  which are subjective in nature 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as business and economic trends and government regulation 
management believes that the assumptions used to determine fair value are appropriate and reasonable 
however  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company s results of operations 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate this reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances 
we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that we may not realize when we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize all or some portion of our deferred tax assets based upon our judgments regarding future events and past operating results 
we adopted the provisions of fin on december   the first day of our fiscal year
