overview avistar creates technology that provides the missing critical element in unified communications bringing people in organizations face to face  through enhanced communications for true collaboration anytime  anyplace 
our latest product  avistar c  draws on over a decade of market experience to deliver a single click desktop videoconferencing and collaboration experience that moves business communications into a new era 
available as a stand alone solution  or integrated with existing unified communications software from other vendors  avistar c users gain an instant messaging style ability to initiate video communications across and outside the enterprise 
patented bandwidth management enables thousands of users to access desktop videoconferencing  voice over ip  or voip  and streaming media without requiring substantial new network investment or impairing network performance 
by integrating avistar c tightly into the way they work  our customers can use our solutions to help reduce costs and improve productivity and communications within the enterprise and between enterprises  and to enhance relationships with customers  suppliers and partners 
using avistar c software and leveraging video  telephony and internet networking standards  avistar solutions are designed to be scalable  reliable  cost effective  easy to use  and capable of evolving with communications networks as bandwidth increases and as new standards and protocols emerge 
we currently sell our system directly and indirectly to the smb and enterprise markets comprising the global our objective is to establish our technology as the standard for networked visual unified communications and collaboration through direct sales  indirect channel sales partnerships and the licensing of our technology to others 
we also seek to license our broad portfolio of patents covering  among other areas  video and rich media collaboration technologies  networked real time text and non text communications and desktop workstation echo cancellation 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending december we operate in two segments 
our products division engages in the design  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of networked video communications products and associated support services 
our intellectual property division engages in the prosecution  maintenance  support and licensing of the intellectual property and technology that we have developed  some of which is used in our products 
since inception  we have recognized the innovative value of our research and development efforts  and have invested in securing protection for these innovations through domestic and foreign patent applications and issuance 
as of december   we held us and foreign patents  which we look to license to others in the collaboration technology marketplace 
in september  we announced an intensive set of corporate initiatives aimed at increasing our product sales  expanding our customer deployments and support  improving our corporate efficiency and increasing our development capacity 
the first components of this initiative included implementing changes in our management team and centering our sales and marketing activities  and associated management functions in our new york city office  introducing a new go to market strategy and delivery model for hosting desktop video services  a fully managed  turnkey  desktop video solution that provides comprehensive video communications and data sharing capabilities without the need for companies to install and maintain on site video infrastructure  supplementing our position in the financial services vertical by expanding our market focus to additional verticals with complex business problems  where our collaboration products can help global organizations speed business processes  save costs and reduce their carbon footprints  implementing aggressive cost control measures including a reduction in our employees from an average of in to approximately in the three months ended march   and pursuing multiple distribution  services and technology partners 
these and other changes in our business are aimed at reducing our structural costs  increasing our organizational and partner driven capacity  leveraging our reputation for innovation and intellectual property leadership  and growing and expanding our business 
however  these organizational changes and initiatives involve transitional costs and expenses and result in uncertainty in terms of their implementation and their impact on our business and there can be no assurance that these initiatives will achieve our intended objectives 
on february  we announced that microsoft corporation had filed requests for re examination of of our us patents 
subsequently  microsoft also filed requests for re examination of the remaining us patents 
the uspto has approximately two months to decide whether to grant the requests and engage in a formal re examination 
patent re examination  if undertaken by the uspto  could take between six months and two years 
we believe that our us patents are valid and we intend to defend our patents through any re examination process 
however  the re examination of patents by the uspto is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process in which the ultimate outcome is uncertain 
if the uspto elects to re examine some or all of our us patents  we will be required to spend substantial time and resources defending our patents  including the fees and expenses of our legal advisors 
accordingly  we do not expect to recognize significant new licensing revenue or income from settlement and licensing activities during the re examination process 
the re examination of some or all of our us patents  if granted by the uspto  may adversely impact our licensing negotiations in process  our financial condition  and results of operations and may require us to seek additional financing to fund our operations and defense of our patents 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  income from settlement and patent licensing  stock based compensation  valuation of accounts receivable  and valuation of inventories 
revenue recognition we derive product revenue from the sale and licensing of our video enabled networked communications system  consisting of a suite of avistar designed software and hardware products  including third party components 
we also derive revenue from fees for installation  maintenance  support  training services and software development 
in addition  we derive revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio 
product revenue as a percentage of total revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
we recognize product and services revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
we derive product revenue from the sale and licensing of a set of desktop endpoint products hardware and software and infrastructure products hardware and software that combine to form an avistar video enabled collaboration solution 
services revenue includes revenue from installation services  post contract customer support  training  out of pocket expenses  freight and software development 
the installation services that we offer to customers relate to the physical set up and configuration of desktop and infrastructure components of our solution 
the fair value of all product  installation services  post contract customer support and training offered to customers is determined based on the price charged when such products or services are sold separately 
arrangements that include multiple product and service elements may include software and hardware products  as well as installation services  post contract customer support and training 
pursuant to sop  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software and hardware to our customers physically 
our standard delivery terms are fob shipping point 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard terms generally require payment within to days of the date of invoice 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  but rather involve extended payment terms  we may not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and would then recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with which we have had a history of successful collections 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when cash is collected 
if there are any undelivered elements  we defer revenue for those elements  as long as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for the undelivered elements 
additionally  when we provide installation services  the product and installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation process and receipt of customer confirmation  subject to the satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
we believe that the fee associated with the delivered product elements does not meet the collectibility criteria if the installation services have not been completed 
customer confirmation is obtained and documented by means of a standard form indicating the installation services were provided and the hardware and software components were installed 
when the customer or a third party provides installation services  the product revenue is recognized upon shipment  subject to satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
payment for product is due upon shipment  subject to specific payment terms 
payment for installation and professional services is due upon providing the services  subject to specific payment terms 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses and shipping costs incurred during installation and support services have not been significant to date 
these expenses are recognized as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the price charged for maintenance and or support is defined in the product sale contract  and is based on a fixed price for both hardware and software components as stipulated in the customer agreement 
customers have the option to renew the maintenance and or support services in subsequent periods at the same or similar rate as paid in the initial year subject to contractual adjustments for inflation in some cases 
revenue from maintenance and support is recognized pro rata over the maintenance and or support term  which is typically one year in length 
payments for services made in advance of the provision of services are recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
training services are offered independently of the purchase of product 
the value of these training services is determined based on the price charged when such services are sold separately 
training revenue is recognized upon performance of the service 
we recognize service revenue from software development contracts in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue related to contracts for software development is recognized using the percentage of completion method  when all of the following conditions are met a contract exists with the customer at a fixed price  we have fulfilled all of our material contractual obligations to the customer for each deliverable of the contract  verification of completion of the deliverable has been received  and collection of the receivable is probable 
amounts billed to customers in excess of revenues recognized to date are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
assumptions used for recording revenue and earnings are adjusted in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs to complete the contract 
any anticipated losses on contracts in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
we also recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio  according to sop  based on the terms of the royalty  partnership and cross licensing agreements involved 
in the event that a license to our intellectual property is granted after the commencement of litigation between us and the licensee  the proceeds of such transaction are recognized as licensing revenue by us only if sufficient historical evidence exists for the determination of fair value of the licensed patents to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues  consistent with fasb con as of december   these criteria for recognizing license revenue following the commencement of litigation have not been met  and proceeds received after commencement of litigation have therefore been recorded in income from settlement and patent licensing in our statement of operations 
in june  we entered into a patent license agreement with radvision ltd 
under the license agreement  we granted radvision and its subsidiaries a license in the field of videoconferencing to all of our patents  patent applications and patents issuing therefrom with a filing date on or before may  also under the license agreement  radvision granted to us a license in the field of videoconferencing to all of radvision s patents  patent applications and patents issuing there from with a filing date on or before may  the license agreement includes mutual releases of the parties from claims of past infringement of the licensed patents 
as partial consideration for the licenses and releases granted under the agreement  radvision made a one time license payment to us of million  which was recognized as licensing revenue in the three months ended june  to date  a significant portion of our revenue has resulted from sales to a limited number of customers  particularly deutsche bank ag and their affiliates and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates 
in  these customers and radvision ltd 
accounted for million  or of our total revenue 
in  these customers and sony corporation and its subsidiaries  including scei accounted for million  or of our total revenue 
deutsche bank ag and their affiliates and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates accounted for million  or of our revenue for no other customers individually contributed greater than of our total revenue for and or as of december   three customers represented  and of gross accounts receivable 
we anticipate that our revenue  and therefore  our operating results for any given period  will continue to depend to a significant extent on a limited number of customers 
as a result  the loss of or a reduction in sales to any one of these customers would have a significant adverse impact on our operations and financial performance 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for  for and for income from settlement and patent licensing we recognize the proceeds from settlement and patent licensing agreements based on the terms involved 
when litigation has been filed prior to a settlement and patent licensing agreement  and insufficient historical evidence exists for the determination of fair value of the patents licensed to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues  we report all proceeds in income from settlement and patent licensing within operating costs and expenses 
the gain portion of the proceeds  when sufficient historical evidence exists to segregate the proceeds  would be reported in other income according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
to date  all proceeds from settlement and patent licensing agreements entered into following the commencement of litigation have been reported as income from settlement and patent licensing 
when a patent license agreement is entered into prior to the commencement of litigation  we report the proceeds of such transaction as licensing revenue in the period in which such proceeds are received  subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above 
on february   we entered into a patent license agreement with tandberg asa  tandberg telecom as and tandberg  inc under this agreement  we dismissed our infringement suit against tandberg  tandberg dismissed its infringement suit against us  and we cross licensed each other s patent portfolios 
the agreement resulted in a payment of million to us from tandberg 
we recognized the gross proceeds of million from the patent license agreement as income from settlement and patent licensing within operations in the three months ended march  to recognize the proceeds as revenue  we would have required sufficient history of transactions to allow us to isolate the aspect of the settlement attributable to the gain associated with the process of litigation  separate from commercial compensation for the use of our intellectual property 
sufficient evidence was not available to allow this distinction 
the patent license agreement with tandberg includes a ten year capture period  extending from the date of the agreement  during which patents filed with a priority date within the capture period would be licensed in addition to existing patents on the agreement date 
however  such additional patents would be licensed under the agreement solely for purposes of the manufacture  sale  license or other transfer of existing products of tandberg and products that are closely related enhancements of such products based primarily and substantially on the existing products 
we reviewed the existing products of tandberg and considered the likelihood that future patent filings by us would relate to or otherwise affect existing tandberg products and closely related enhancements thereto 
we concluded that the filing for such additional patents was unlikely  and therefore concluded that the ten year capture period was not material from an accounting perspective related to recognition 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees according to the sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a very complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes merton assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option terms  as well as expected option forfeiture rates 
there is little experience or guidance with respect to developing these assumptions and models 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income loss 
refer to note stock based compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report of form k for more information 
valuation of accounts receivable estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical collection experience  historical write offs  current trends  and the credit quality of our customer base and the characteristics of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were to be understated  our operating income could be significantly reduced 
the impact of any such change or deviation may be increased by our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenue 
as of december   three customers represented  and of our gross accounts receivable balance 
as of december   three customers represented  and of our gross accounts receivable balance 
valuation of inventories we record a provision for obsolete or excess inventory for systems and components that are no longer manufactured  or are at risk of being replaced with new versions of our product 
in determining the allowance for obsolete or excess inventory  we look at our forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and commitments 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  provision for purchase commitments and charges against earnings may be required  which would negatively affect our operating results for such period

the level of sales to any customer may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period 
the loss of any one of those customers would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results

the litigation concluded in a patent license agreement on february   resulting in a decrease in of million in ongoing litigation expenses due to the cessation of the litigation against tandberg 
this decrease was offset by an increase in of million of patent prosecution fees due to increased activity related to patent applications on file with the uspto

we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including without limitation  general economic conditions and conditions in the financial services industry in particular  the level and timing of product  services and licensing revenue  the costs and timing of our product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of our sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs and proceeds involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  all of which may impact our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional debt or equity financing arrangements may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed
