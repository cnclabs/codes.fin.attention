risk factors in these risk factors  we  us  our  and zixcorp refer to zix corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and our pocketscript e prescribing service continues to use significant amounts of cash 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and we expect to incur operating losses in our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market and developing this business is costly 
our e prescribing business has consumed a significant amount of cash since we entered the e prescribing business in mid  and we expect the e prescribing business to consume cash ie  be cash flow negative in emerging market businesses involve risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to achieve profitability for this line of business 
our liquidity and capital resources remain limited 
to date  our cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to fund our on going operations and we have relied on equity and debt financings to fund our operations during the last few years 
while the company s goal is to be cash flow positive overall  in the near term  there is no assurance this will occur 
consequently  there can be no assurance that our liquidity or capital resource position would allow us to continue to pursue our current business strategy  particularly our e prescribing line of business 
as a result  without achieving growth in our business along the lines we have projected  we would have to alter our business plan or further augment our cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions 
there is no assurance that any of these actions would be possible or could be implemented on terms acceptable to the company 
additionally  one or more of these actions would likely substantially diminish the value of our common stock 
the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our email encryption and e prescribing solutions and services  at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our company wide costs in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
our email encryption business segment has begun to yield positive cash flow from operations  but there are no assurances that it will continue to yield sufficient cash flow to overcome the negative cash flow from the e prescribing segment and our corporate overhead costs 
as noted  our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market 
there is no assurance that this market will develop sufficiently to enable us to operate our pocketscript business profitably 
we have been pursuing the e prescribing business since mid  and our pursuit of the business has consumed significant amounts of cash and the e prescribing business is projected to continue to consume cash for the foreseeable future 
see end users of our pocketscript service may not continue to use the service under risk factors below and item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  below 
failure to enter into additional or to maintain existing sponsorship agreements for our pocketscript e prescribing service and generate other revenue sources from our pocketscript service could harm our business 
our pocketscript business has incurred significant operating losses 
through december   significant orders for our pocketscript e prescribing service came from sponsorship agreements with healthcare payors 
under our payor sponsorship business model  we deploy pocketscript to the end user physician and provide the end user physician a subscription to use the service in return for payments from the healthcare payor 
these payments are in the form of guaranteed payments from the healthcare payor or contingent payments that are based on contractually specified performance metrics 
in some cases  these contingent payments could represent a substantial portion of the revenue opportunity under the contract 
the significant majority of all of the end user physicians who are using the pocketscript service and for whom we are currently recognizing revenue are doing so under a subscription arrangement that has been paid for by a healthcare payor 
if the healthcare payors fail to renew their sponsorships  there is no assurance that the physicians will pay to continue to use the pocketscript service 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  below 

table of contents in addition  we obtain cash and revenue from prescription transaction fees from payors  pharmacy benefit managers and others with respect to the electronic prescriptions processed through our e prescribing service 
increasing our active physician user base and increasing prescription transaction and performance based fees are critical to the success of our plan to achieve profitability in our e prescribing business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we will not achieve significant cash and revenues from our e prescribing service unless we sign follow on orders from our existing healthcare payors  from whom a significant portion of our cash and revenues are received  or sign new sponsorship agreements with other payors  or generate significant revenue from contingent payments  or maintain and identify other revenue opportunities for our e prescribing service  such as add on applications or prescription transaction fees  and or new uses for the transaction data itself 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve all or any of these requirements 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 
physicians and other healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service 
our pocketscript service is targeted to the emerging market for e prescribing which provides physicians the ability to use a handheld device to prescribe drugs and transmit prescriptions electronically to any retail pharmacy 
through the use of the handheld device  the physician is provided with real time decision support at the point of care  such as insurance formulary and drug interactions  that would normally not be available in a paper prescription process 
this enables the physician to leverage technology for better patient care 
this is an emerging market  and the success of our pocketscript service is dependent  in large measure  on physicians changing the manner in which they write prescriptions 
our challenge is to make this new service attractive to physicians  and ultimately  profitable 
to do so has required  and in the foreseeable future will require  us to invest significant amounts of cash and other resources 
there is no assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate the pocketscript service profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 
end users of our pocketscript service may not continue to use the service 
the company currently estimates approximately  to  active physician users subscribers of the e prescribing service are needed to cover its e prescribing fixed costs 
as of december   the company had approximately  such active prescribers of the service  as compared to approximately  such active prescribers as of december  see the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably and physicians and other healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service in risk factors above 
not all users to whom the e prescribing service is deployed will become active users 
furthermore  the company has experienced attrition in its base of active users 
thus  there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve a sufficient number of active users to build a successful e prescribing business 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenue indicators backlog  orders and deployments 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 
failure to significantly increase our base of pocketscript users or obtain significant prescription transaction fees  or other fees may result in failure to achieve the critical mass of physicians and revenue to build a successful business 
we incur significant up front costs in connection with initially establishing our pocketscript e prescribing service with the physician users 
under our current business model  third party payors typically pay all or a majority of the variable costs of initially establishing our e prescribing service 
our plan is to obtain additional revenues in the form of recurring annual subscription fees to use our e prescribing service  either paid by the third party payors or the physicians 
in addition  we must obtain additional revenues from prescription transaction fees  or other fees to operate this line of business profitably 
increasing our physician user base and increasing prescription transaction fees  or generating other fees  are critical to the success of this plan 
some of the prescription transaction fees that we currently receive are from pharmacy benefit managers  which manage the prescription benefits for their health plan customers  and an electronic script aggregator  which receives scripts written by the physician user of our pocketscript e prescribing service and transmits them via electronic data interchange to retail pharmacies 
our contracts with some of these entities are short term  meaning that the other party could cancel the contract or require us to renegotiate the contract with less favorable terms and conditions 
these unfavorable terms and conditions could increase our costs and could require us to revise our business model 

table of contents in sum  there is no assurance as to whether we will be able to maintain  or whether and how quickly we will be able to increase our user base or prescription transaction fees or whether we will be able to generate other fees to such a level that would enable this line of business to operate profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 
competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could impair our prospects and cause our business to fail 
our email encryption services are targeted to the email encryption market 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  well funded competitors have entered the market 
companies that compete with our email encryption service include content management and secure delivery companies  such as tumbleweed communications corp  and other secure delivery participants  such as voltage security  postx recently acquired by cisco systems inc  pgp corporation  certified mail  authentica  secure computing  rxnt  and sigaba corporation 
in addition  we face competition from vendors of operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions  security solutions and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle email encryption into their products 
some of these competing companies have substantial information technology security and email protection products and have greater financial resources 
in summary  current email encryption customers could move to competitive solutions  which would harm our business 
our pocketscript e prescribing service applies the benefits of e messaging to the medical prescription process by enabling providers to write and transmit prescriptions electronically directly to the pharmacy 
competition is expected to increase as this emerging market continues to develop and it becomes generally apparent that there are viable business models for commercial success in this market 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  dr 
first  inc  instantdx llc  iscribe  prematics and rxnt 
competition from these companies and from vendors in related areas  such as electronic medical records vendors who generally include e prescribing services as an element of their service offering is expected to increase 
these competitors could have more financial  technical  and other resources than the company 
companies that do not currently compete with zixcorp or only compete with selected products or in selected markets could become competitors in the future on a larger scale 
companies such as ge healthcare or mckesson corporation would likely offer a broad portfolio of health information technologies for all or some of the pharmaceutical  pharmacy  healthcare provider and managed care markets 
this bundled array of services and solutions could be attractive to our current and potential customers 
favorable regulatory developments could hasten the entrance of these competitors into the market  particularly the e prescribing market 
see regulatory drivers for market growth above 
with considerable size and access to capital  they could become significant competitors 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new solution and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective or cost efficient than our own 
these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any one of which could materially harm our business 
our inability to successfully timely develop and introduce new email encryption and e prescribing services and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the evolving nature of the email encryption and e prescribing businesses require us to continually develop and introduce new and related solutions and services and to improve the performance  features and reliability of our existing solutions and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we have under development new functionality for our email encryption and e prescribing businesses 
we may also introduce new services 
the success of new or enhanced functionalities and services depends on several factors primarily market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced functionalities and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could materially harm our business 

table of contents future asset impairments could affect our financial results 
as of december   we have  of goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the email encryption segment 
goodwill is evaluated at least on an annual basis or whenever there is a reason to question if the goodwill values are impaired 
we also have  of property and other long lived assets 
the carrying value of these assets is evaluated whenever there is reason to question if the values are impaired 
future events could impact the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  which could require us to recognize a non cash charge to earnings 
it is possible that we may incur further charges for other asset impairments in the future as we evaluate the prospects of our various lines of business 
any such charges could materially affect our financial results 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point if we achieve greater market penetration we may be required to materially expand and or upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our network  particularly since we have significantly expanded our potential customer base by the growing use of our pocketscript service 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities in a timely manner to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not appropriately expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software in a timely fashion  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our solutions and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our data centers currently  our zixdata center located in dallas  texas  and the austin  texas data center used for fail over and business continuity services 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other events beyond our control 
we carry limited insurance coverage to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs 
this could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to provide our services and to support the email encryption and e prescribing services depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers for these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers and similar disruptions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
secure messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our email encryption service  include personal healthcare information as well as personal financial information 
this information will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network 
also  individual prescription histories transmitted through our e prescribing system and other personally identifiable healthcare information may reside in our secure data center network indefinitely 
federal and state laws impose significant financial penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
exposure of this information  resulting from any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information  could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our services again 

table of contents we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors in our services could harm our business 
we subject our solutions and services to quality assurance testing prior to release 
regardless of the quality assurance testing  any of our solutions could contain undetected defects or errors 
in particular  our pocketscript system is used to transmit prescriptions 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
undetected defects or errors could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
any one of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our email encryption service and the e prescribing service employ  and future solutions and services may employ  public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such services could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could increase our costs  damage our reputation  or otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  from time to time there are public reports of the successful decryption of encrypted messages or encrypted information 
this or related publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman and ceo  richard d 
spurr  and his direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees that prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we rely on third parties 
if critical services and products that we source from third parties were to no longer be made available to us or at a considerably higher price than we currently pay for them  and suitable alternatives could not be found  our business could be harmed 
for certain elements of our service offerings  we sometimes rely on the products and services of third parties 
in particular  we rely on third parties to supply the hand held device used by the prescribing physician users of our e prescribing service 
in and  we were using primarily one supplier for this purpose 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an end of life product notice from this vendor 
consequently  we procured sufficient quantities of this device to accommodate forecasted deployments 
the company tested alternative devices in and has now chosen a new handheld device vendor for if these third parties  in general  elect to withhold their products or services or significantly raise their prices  we could be damaged financially in lower returns on sales and a lessening of competitive advantages if suitable alternatives could not be found in a reasonable period of time 
also  we have data interchange agreements with third parties  who source data and or transport transactions relevant to the overall decision support and electronic prescribing capability offered by our pocketscript service 
these third parties require us to adhere certify to their technical requirements 
our failure to maintain these technical certifications could hurt our competitiveness and impair our ability to secure new customers for our pocketscript service and maintain existing customers 

table of contents we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption technology  such as our email encryption service  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our email encryption service to almost all countries  the list of countries to which our solutions and services cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services  such as ours 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our solutions and services in international markets and  therefore  harm the company s ability to grow sales through expansion into international markets 
our largest oem partner does sell and distribute our email encryption service in overseas markets 
there has been growing support from both inside and outside of the federal government for mandating e prescribing of medicare prescriptions  culminating with the introduction of the e meds bill in the senate and a corresponding bill in the house  which would have written such a mandate for e prescribing medicare prescriptions into law 
e meds bill has been rolled into the debate on a more permanent resolution for some of medicare s bigger issues that need to be revisited mid year in  which may or may not increase the chances of its ultimate passage 
even if the federal government does mandate e prescribing for medicare prescriptions  the company believes any legislation mandating e prescribing would have a phase in period  so it is unlikely that a mandate would be in effect in or even therefore  while the existence of a mandate in the future would most likely lower the effort needed to sell physicians on the benefits of e prescribing and would potentially increase the company s active and retention rates  there could be adverse effects  such as increased competition or a need for the company to change the manner in which it recruits  deploys  and trains its physician users 
the federal government has adopted regulations to create an exception to the prohibition on physicians referrals to healthcare entities with which they have financial relationships for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr v  and an exception to the related federal healthcare anti kickback rules for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr x 
the purpose of the regulations is to encourage physicians to use electronic prescribing systems to create and deliver prescriptions to the pharmacy 
the regulations seek to accomplish this purpose by creating certain safe harbors that are intended to encourage healthcare entities  such as health insurance companies and hospitals  to provide financial incentives to physicians to use electronic prescribing systems 
these regulations  as they are interpreted and enforced over time  could provide other participants in the market a competitive advantage or could have currently unforeseen consequences that harm our business 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our e prescribing business operates regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which our e prescribing business currently operates generally permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which our e prescribing business does not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
also  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
many of these standards are currently being pilot tested in their initial form and may be subject to change  accelerated compliance restrictions or select re implementations  based on resulting industry recommendations 
the costs of compliance could be substantial 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
also  as of february   there was a reported short position in our common stock of  shares approximately of our outstanding number of shares  which may affect the volatility of our stock price 
we have a significant amount of stock options and warrants outstanding and may issue additional equity securities in the future 
exercise of the outstanding options and warrants  and future issuances of other securities will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
we have outstanding warrants and options  including options held by our employees  covering approximately million shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging from to 

table of contents the issuances of shares of common stock in respect of these warrants and options would result in a substantial voting dilution of our current shareholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and options could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in the future  we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses  which could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued in public or private transactions  at or below the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  we motivate our employees and attract new employees by issuing shares of our common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the interest of our existing shareholders may be diluted by any equity securities issued in capital funding financings or business acquisitions and would be diluted by any such future share issuances and stock option grants to employees 
finally  as a result of the anti dilution provisions of certain of the warrants described above  we may be obligated to increase the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise of our warrants and reduce the exercise price of such warrants 
we might also be obligated to register with the sec additional shares of common stock issuable to the warrant holders for public resale 
the company may be required to pay liquidated damages in the event one or more of the registration statements it has filed with the sec for the benefit of third parties ceases to be effective 
the company has filed a number of registration statements with the sec for the benefit of third parties 
these registration statements permit the public resale of the company s common stock held by  or potentially issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to  these parties 
in some cases  the company would be required to pay liquidated damages to the third parties if the company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the relevant registration statement for the contractually required period of time 
the amount of damages the company would be required to pay could be substantial  as a percentage of the company s cash on hand  depending on when the registration statement ceased to be effective 
see  for example  note to the company s consolidated financial statements  regarding the potential payment of liquidated damages related to the april  private placement 
there are no assurances that we will be successful or that we will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in our periodic filings with the sec 
we are  of course  also subject to general economic risks

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of january   the company operated two reporting segments  email encryption and e prescribing 
each segment hosts applications that protect and deliver high volumes of sensitive information in a secure manner  targeting the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors 
the company employs a software as a service saas subscription model for delivering its services to the market 

table of contents the company s primary business strategy is the continued development and growth of its subscription businesses 
the company seeks to build and maintain reliable revenue growth by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
the subscription model requires large up front investment to establish the service  but over time the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription and transaction fees 
the subscription business provides better returns after the setup costs are overcome as incremental costs to add new users are low relative to the incremental subscription revenue 
as a secondary  but equally important  business strategy  the company is balancing the cash produced by its more mature segment  email encryption  with the cash required to develop its emerging segment  e prescribing 
operationally  the success of the company is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the email encryption service  renewal rates for the email encryption service  additional payor sponsorship of the e prescribing service to physicians by new or existing insurance payors  successful adoption and usage of the e prescribing service by physicians  retention of the users physicians of the e prescribing service as indicated by subscription renewals  future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the e prescribing service  and our ability to increase business volume with reasonable cost increases 
known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on the company s current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this md a 
there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts to achieve success in these key metrics 
the company s continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
the company has incurred significant operating losses and used significant cash resources in prior years 
the company experienced improvement in its cash flow performance in and the company will continue to place a strong emphasis on actions to become cash flow breakeven in the near term  while balancing the needs for investments in its developing and emerging markets 
actions taken by the company to achieve the goal of cash flow breakeven  such as near term cost reductions  or decreased investments in certain areas of the business or business divestitures  might have intended or unintended short term adverse effects on certain financial performance metrics for the company 
despite its recent improved cash flow performance  the company does expect to report further operating losses in its consolidated financial statements for see item a  risk factors for more information on risk factors relevant to the company s operations and future prospects 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
inventory the company s inventory consists mainly of the costs of handheld devices and related networking hardware for e prescribing and is reported as a component of prepaid and other current assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the inventory is valued at average purchase price and is reviewed quarterly for potential adjustments resulting from lower of cost or market valuations or obsolescence 
as a general practice  the company maintains a to day supply of inventory 
however  in late  the company received an end of life product notice from its handheld device vendor 
as a result  the company procured additional quantities of handheld devices sufficient to accommodate the forecasted e prescribing deployments 
with the supply of handheld devices resolved as of december   inventory levels had returned to normal maintenance levels of to days supply 

table of contents property and equipment  long lived and other intangible assets  depreciation and amortization the accounting policies and estimates relating to the property and equipment  long lived and other intangible assets  depreciation and amortization are considered critical because of the significant impact that impairment  obsolescence  or change in an asset s useful life could have on the company s operating results 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows computer and office equipment and software three years  leasehold improvements the shorter of five years or the lease term  and furniture and fixtures five years 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three years 
the company s long lived assets subject to amortization and depreciation are comprised of identified intangible assets and property and equipment aggregating  or of total assets at december  property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when certain triggering events occur where there is reason to believe that the carrying value may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
there were no such impairments in the amount of a potential impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to either the value determined from a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model or the estimated fair market value 
assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset 
an impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows or estimated fair market value 
also  even where a current impairment charge is not necessary  the remaining useful lives are evaluated 
during the first quarter of  the company evaluated the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets relating to the mydoconline acquisition and concluded that the lives for developed technology and customer relationships should be reduced to three years from five years and four years  respectively 
this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively beginning january  in  the company recorded  of impairment charges on fixed assets that were not being utilized and had no perceived future value 
in  the company recorded no impairment charges 
goodwill goodwill  totaling  or of total assets at december  and  represents the remaining cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the september acquisition of elron software 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not being amortized  however  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the sale of the message inspector and web inspector products in the first quarter of  which were a significant part of the elron acquisition  caused the company to evaluate the goodwill assigned to the esecure reporting unit 
as a result  the company reduced goodwill in the first quarter of by  as part of the carrying value of the net assets related to that transaction 
this represented of the acquired goodwill from the elron acquisition 
the sale of the dr 
chart product in september caused the company to evaluate the goodwill associated with the purchase of mydoconline  of which dr 
chart was a significant portion 
as a result  the company included in the carrying amount of assets sold in the dr 
chart sale  the entire goodwill balance of  associated with the acquisition of mydoconline 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure of these transactions 

table of contents future changes made to the current estimates or assumptions  including such factors as order volumes and price levels  life spans of purchased technology  continuity of acquired customers  alternative uses for property and equipment and levels of operating expenses  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge from the write down of the company s long lived assets or goodwill 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the subject net operating loss carry forwards and unused tax credits will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
if the company begins to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which its estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as promulgated by statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  eitf abstract no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 
accounting for revenue is complex due to the long term and often multiple element nature of zixcorp s contracts with customers  and the potential for incorrect application of accounting guidance requires that revenue recognition be considered a critical accounting policy 
the company develops  markets  licenses and supports electronic information protection services 
the company s services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption subscription based service  e prescribing service  various transaction fees and related professional services 
a majority of the revenues generated by the company are through direct sales  however  for the email encryption service the company employs a network of distributors and resellers 
under all product categories and distribution models  the company recognizes revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event the arrangement has multiple elements with delivered and undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered elements are recognized under the residual method only when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate the fair value of the total fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
occasionally  when zixcorp is engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
the email encryption service is a subscription based service 
in the first nine months of  subscription based services also included dr 
chart  which was sold by the company in september see note to the consolidated financial statements 
providing these services includes delivering subscribed for software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
in the case of zixvpm  typically  as part of the service  an appliance with pre installed software is installed at the customer site at the beginning of the subscription period 
in a subscription service  the customer does not own a perpetual right to a software license  but is instead granted the use of the subscribed for software during the period of the service subscription 
subscriptions are generally multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
the subscription period begins on the date specified by the parties or when the service is fully functional for the customer which is consequently deemed to be the date of acceptance 
revenues from subscription services are recorded as service revenue as the services are rendered from the date of acceptance over the subscription period 
subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
the e prescribing service arrangements contain multiple deliverables  including both hardware and services 
due to the lack of vsoe  these elements are combined into a single unit of accounting and  similar to email encryption  recognized as service revenue ratably over the longer of the subscription term or expected renewal period 
revenue recognition begins upon installation of the required hardware and commencement of service 

table of contents prior to the third quarter  the company did maintain vsoe for certain service elements of the e prescribing service 
accordingly  the residual value assigned to the pocketscript handheld device was recognized as revenue upon installation and the fair value of the undelivered services were recognized ratably over the period in which those services were delivered 
some of the company s services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs or when the predetermined usage levels have been achieved  and when the amounts are fixed and determinable 
the company does not offer stand alone services 
further  the company s services include various warranty provisions  however  warranty expense was not material to any period presented 
deferred cost of revenue in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy  the revenue associated with certain pocketscript deployments is being recognized ratably over the period the services are being delivered 
to properly match direct costs and revenue  the company defers the direct  incremental costs of each deployment expected to be recovered 
these costs consist mainly of the cost of the handheld device  and are recorded as deferred cost of revenue 
the deferred costs are then amortized into cost of revenue ratably over the period in which revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost of revenue of  and  is included in other assets as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  and elected to use the modified prospective method along with the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
for periods prior to january   the company used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
sfas r replaced the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb and requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  ie  the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires companies to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be earned  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the company used the black scholes option pricing model bsopm to determine the fair value of option grants made during   and the company estimated the average holding period of vested options to be two years from the vesting period years for options granted before  but used the simplified method per sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate the estimated life of options granted to employees subsequent to december  the expected stock price volatility was calculated by averaging the historical volatility of the company s common stock over a term equal to the expected life of the options 
the following weighted average assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of options granted during the respective periods year ended december  risk free interest rate expected option life years years years expected stock price volatility expected dividend yield fair value of options granted the assumptions used in the bsopm valuation are critical as a change in any given factor could have a material impact on the financial results of the company

with this payment  the company ended calendar year with no short term or long term indebtedness for borrowed money 
financing activities resulting from exercise of warrants and options during the fourth quarter of  the company received cash proceeds totaling approximately  for the exercise of  warrants and  for the exercise of  stock options

email encryption e prescribing subtotal before divested products or services mi wi products dr 
chart and connect subtotal divested products or services total revenues email encryption the revenue increases of  and  in email encryption for and  respectively  over the previous years revenue are due to the company adding new subscribers to the service while renewing a high percentage of existing subscribers as their service contracts expired 
revenues are recognized as the service is provided and therefore the revenue increase of  is primarily due to new first year orders nfyo s generated in the company s additions to the subscriber base is best measured by nfyo s  which are defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
in and the new first year orders were approximately  and  respectively 
as the company has continued to add new customers  the renewal rate of existing customers has consistently remained above for the periods shown which  in turn  has led to the company s yearly revenue growth 
the recurring nature of the subscription model makes revenue rise in a predictable manner assuming continued new additions to the subscription base and adequate subscription renewal rates 
adding to the predictability is the company s go to market model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
the company s list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent in when compared with and the company has experienced relatively consistent discount percentages off the list price in those periods 
the company did announce a slight price increase for its zixvpm  zixvpm alliance and zixvpm corporate services effective in january in general  customers that are due for renewal are renewed at a price equal to or greater than their previous service period 
e prescribing e prescribing revenues increased  in compared to this increase was primarily driven by an increase in renewal revenues of  in compared to also driving improvement were transaction usage based fees which increased by  when compared to additionally  revenue recognized on deployments to new pocketscript users increased  when compared to the total new users of the service for which revenue could be recognized decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in due to lack of contracts for new payor sponsorships and or expansion programs initiated in by existing payors 
however  this decrease in new billable users was offset in part by an increase in the average price per billable deployment of approximately 
revenues relating to one time projects increased  in when compared to these one time projects are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis and usually relate to special projects and requests made by customers 
other e prescribing revenue declined  in compared to 
table of contents one customer accounted for  of the increase in transaction usage based fees and this customer is only contractually bound to continue paying the majority of these fees through the company is working with the customer to continue these fees and  if not successful in doing so  it will endeavor to replace them with new contracts with existing and or new customers  but it is not known if the company will be successful in its efforts 
the revenues in e prescribing increased by  when compared to this increase was mainly driven by transaction usage based fees which increased by  when compared to additionally  revenue recognized on deployments to new pocketscript users  service renewals  and one time projects increased  when compared to divested products the decline in revenues from the web inspector and message inspector products and the dr 
chart products resulted from the divestitures of these products in march and september  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue outlook the company s future revenue growth in is primarily expected to come from continued success in the email encryption business  while targeting the healthcare  finance  insurance and government sectors 
email encryption revenue growth is expected to mirror the performance rate of approximately 
while the company has experienced a greater than revenue increase in e prescribing for both and  continued growth in this segment is almost entirely dependent on the company securing new or expanding existing payor sponsorship contracts in the first six months of calendar year in  the company secured commitments with payors to deploy significantly fewer new prescribers than in previous years 
consequently  the company s backlog of yet to be deployed new prescribers at the end of was significantly lower than the backlog at the end of thus  absent securing contracts for a sufficient number of new sponsored prescribers in the first half of  the company will expect revenue from its e prescribing services to decline in despite the decline in yet to be deployed new subscribers  the company believes that there is high interest on the part of a currently contracted payors in expanding their existing programs  and b prospective payors who are in the exploratory phases of committing to executing a new sponsorship contract 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in expanding its current payor programs or contracting with new payors 
backlog  orders  and deployments company wide backlog the company s end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that the company expects to fully amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog is comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid  and approximately  of unbilled contracts 
the backlog can also be divided by product  of which  is for email encryption and  is for e prescribing 
the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
the company s future revenue growth from email encryption  beyond what is scheduled to be recognized from the backlog  is determined by total new orders for email encryption  which are made up of renewals from existing customers renewal of usage by previously existing users with previously in use products whose contracts are expiring and new orders new orders from new users in existing customer accounts  new products in existing accounts and brand new customers 
to forecast the near term impact of these new orders orders from new users in existing customer accounts  new products in existing accounts and brand new customers  we use the metric we call new first year orders nfyo s  which only looks at the first months of a new contract contracts are typically years in length to forecast the near term impact on revenue 
for e prescribing the future revenue will be determined by securing additional payor sponsorships  increasing adoption and utilization by the physicians  renewing existing prescribers as they expire  and developing additional transaction based fees 

table of contents email encryption orders total order input for email encryption in was  compared with  in total orders include customer orders that management separates into three components for measurement purposes contract renewals  new first year orders  and in the case of new multi year contracts  the years beyond the first year of service 
the new first year orders were  in and  in the following table provides the relevant trend of new first year orders three month period ending december  september  june  march  total new first year orders for the twelve months ending december  the email encryption contract renewal rate was on a contract value basis  which will lead to continued revenue growth 
beginning in  the company moved to a new metric for measuring its customer renewal rate for email encryption 
previously  the company used a metric that represented the percentage of the number of gateway and portal customer accounts that had renewed 
while this per capita metric was very useful as a measurement of overall customer satisfaction with our services  it did not draw any distinctions between our largest and smallest customers 
the company s new renewal metric is based on the twelve month dollar value of bookings versus the previous twelve month bookings value for the same set of customers rather than the per capita number of customer accounts 
as with the previous method of measurement  this metric will represent bookings from our gateway and portal customers 
in general  contracts are renewed at a price equal to or greater than their previous service period 
however  there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
such a price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on the company s renewal related revenue 
the company continues to experience a high percentage of customers who choose to subscribe to the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
the company expects this preference by a high percentage of its customers for a longer contract term to continue in  as the company has priced its services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
the company s list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent in when compared to and the company has experienced relatively consistent discount percentages off the list price in those periods 
the company did announce a slight price increase for its zixvpm  zixvpm alliance and zixvpm corporate services effective in january however  there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
such a price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on the customers new first year orders 
while zixcorp continues to foresee steady demand from the healthcare sector  the industry is beginning to mature consequently  the company has increased its efforts to diversify its business into additional sectors 
the company s continued focus on markets such as financial services  insurance and government along with the increased use of indirect distribution channels should enable it to sustain or increase the new first year order rate in e prescribing in e prescribing  the company builds the subscriber base by contracting with health insurance companies payors to sponsor physicians in their network to receive the e prescribing equipment and service free of charge for the first year 
as of december   the company had active contracts with eight such payors 
the current list prices for initial and subsequent annual renewal periods for the e prescribing service are  and  respectively 
the company has secured contracts at the list price and has also succeeded in receiving more beneficial payment terms than in previous years 
in  the company secured sponsorships for new deployments of approximately new prescribers which compares to sponsorships for new deployments of approximately  new subscribers in although new sponsorships  in number  were disappointing  we added one very significant new sponsor  united healthcare 
we believe that a successful pilot with this significant new customer could lead to a broad based  national rollout of our e prescribing service 
future revenue growth of the e prescribing segment is dependent on expanding current payor sponsorships such as the one with united healthcare  as well as securing additional payor contracts  achieving and increasing adoption and utilization by the sponsored physicians  renewing service contracts for active physicians at the end of their sponsorship  and developing additional transaction based fees 

table of contents the deployments of subscribers and the number of active users are indicators of future revenue 
in  the company deployed approximately  users compared with approximately  in the company has approximately sponsored  but not yet deployed  prescribers in deployment backlog as of december  the number of active users is also important as a measurement of the user base 
active users measures the number of subscribers who are effectively using the e prescribing service at a meaningful level in order to generate transaction revenues  and as an indicator of retention and future renewal opportunities 
the company has a twofold objective in deploying new users first  to ensure they become regular users of the service active and second  to ensure that services are renewed retention 
as of december   the company had approximately  active prescribers using the service  compared with approximately  active prescribers at december  based on current trends  the company believes that to of the users deployed in will ultimately become active users 
the company is continuing its efforts to increase the percentage of active users that result from new deployments 
sponsorship contracts typically specify that individual physicians using the e prescribing service assume responsibility for renewing the service after the first year 
however  blue cross and blue shield of massachusetts has renewed the service for its qualified active users for a fourth year  and six of the company s other seven payors have also agreed to pay for some or all of the subscription fee for its active users 
the sponsorship associated with the remaining payor  united healthcare services  inc  was signed in the second half of  and its deployed users are not yet due to renew 
for those users that do not meet the required activity level for continued sponsorship by their particular payor  the company attempts to contract directly with the individual user or medical practice 
the total transaction and usage based fees recognized as revenue during were  compared to  in the company has a contract with a payor sponsor that provides for a shared savings arrangement measured by improvement in physician user prescribing behavior 
the company has also signed four contracts with transaction based fees or the equivalent with existing and new healthcare payors 
while increasing the number of active users should increase the prescriptions written and thus increase the potential for transaction fees under current agreements  substantial revenue increases from transaction fees will require additional transaction based fees from new and existing customers 
the company is seeking such agreements with interested parties 
the company believes that the source of new transaction related fees will come from payors both existing and new payors that sponsor e prescribing programs  as well as other payors that have insured members visiting doctors that already use the pocketscript service via a sponsorship arrangement from another competing payor 
in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and the company believes that those additional non sponsorship payors may be potential sources for supplemental fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
finally  possible sources for other transaction fees include parties who could benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
for example  the company is piloting a disease management program with one of its payors which alerts physicians through the e prescribing service that a patient may be eligible for enrollment 
in addition  the company currently has contracts under which it earns fees for sending prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to pharmacy benefit managers pbm 
the number of prescriptions written using the pocketscript service and thus transmitted through the zixdata center has been growing on a year over year basis 
in  the company transacted approximately  prescriptions compared to  prescriptions in the company is investing greater sales effort and post deployment attention to maximizing utilization in order to maximize future revenue potential both through renewals and transaction fees 
the company believes that the payor sponsorship model is the right one to scale and accelerate adoption and usage and to lay the foundation for secure  interoperable healthcare information access and decision support 
however  continued growth in this segment will require additional payor sponsors or a change in the market demand model and increased revenues from transaction fees or the equivalent

however  the headcount reductions in cost of revenues resulting from these events have been proportionally less than those reductions in the research development and selling  general and administrative expense classifications 
this disproportionate reduction in headcount has resulted in a higher allocation of occupancy costs to cost of revenues 
the increase in stock based compensation costs is due to the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the reductions in personnel costs and travel expenses between years and were primarily due to the workforce reduction and product line divestitures 
the reduction in depreciation expense is due to the divestitures as well  the effects of previously recorded impairments on certain fixed assets and other certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated

table of contents email encryption email encryption s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support and the amortization of company owned  customer based computer appliances 
for email encryption  a significant portion of the total cost of revenues relates to the zixdata center  which is currently not fully utilized 
accordingly  cost of revenues is relatively fixed in nature and is expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue 
email encryption has shown the ability to grow revenues  while leaving cost of revenues flat or only marginally increasing as more efficient methods of product delivery and service have been implemented 
for example  the email encryption revenues for year have increased  or  when compared to year  but the cost of revenues has actually decreased as indicated above 
e prescribing e prescribing s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field prescriber recruiting team  a field deployment team  customer service and support  training and e prescribing device costs 
in e prescribing  a greater proportion of total cost of revenues relates to the field deployment and device costs 
these are more variable in nature than the zixdata center and accordingly  e prescribing costs are more closely correlated with demand 
the  decrease in cost of revenues for total year compared to total year reflects a reduction of approximately  in fixed costs and a reduction in variable costs of  which is primarily the cost of the handheld device 
the reduction in fixed costs is due principally to intangible assets becoming fully amortized between years previously discussed 
the reduction in variable costs is primarily due to a decrease in deployments 
the new billable deployments in were approximately  compared to  in because e prescribing costs of revenues have a greater variable component  a decrease or increase in e prescribing demand  as measured by revenue and deployments  is expected to result in a corresponding decrease or increase in the related cost of revenues

these efforts to reduce overall company spending included the reduction in workforce and actions taken to lower non people costs 
these reductions have been offset in part by the addition of share based compensation costs related to employee and non employee stock options in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the general trend of reduced expenses throughout  and the early part of was a product of a number of cost reduction initiatives executed by the company 
for  the company believes selling  general and administrative expenses will increase slightly due to general inflationary pressures on cash expenses and increases in non cash expenses  principally stock based compensation

total selling  general and administrative expenses the  improvement in selling  general  and administrative expense in versus is made up of  of cash expenses and  in non cash expenses 
the  cash expense decrease was split between people costs and non people costs of  and  respectively 
people costs decreased due to lower headcount 
the significant contributors in lower non people cash expenses were a reduction in occupancy costs of  primarily due to both a change in allocation for it services whereby approximately  of previously unallocated expense was distributed in to the research and development and the cost of revenues categories  and also to a  improvement in telephone service costs  a reduction in professional fees of  a reduction in travel expenses of  due to reduced headcount  and a reduction in advertising and promotion of  due to budget cuts 
the remaining decreases in non people cash expense resulted from cost reductions spread across the following expense categories bad debts  dues and licenses  electronic data processing costs  business insurance and stockholder expense 
these decreases in non people cash expense were partially offset by an effective net increase in taxes of  resulting from recorded tax credits consisting principally of a canadian tax gst tax refund of approximately  and of a  sales and use tax refund involving a prior year transaction with a third party service provider 
the  decrease in non cash expense primarily relates to share based compensation costs between periods  including a prior period credit adjustment of  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining decrease in share based compensation costs is due to a greater portion of vesting stock options having been granted in and with a lower value because of the company s then lower stock price 
the  decrease in selling  general  and administration expense for versus consists primarily of a  decrease in personnel costs and  in non personnel costs 
the principal reasons for the decrease in personnel costs are the divestitures of the mi wi and dr

personnel costs include salaries and wages  severance pay  contract labor  consulting services  benefits and recruitment

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview due to the company s history of operating spending being in excess of customer receipts  liquidity has been and continues to be an item of particular focus for the company s management 
essential to liquidity is the ability of the company to meet its obligations as they become due and in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for the next twelve months as further detailed below 
however  the company operates in only two markets  both of which are still developing and emerging which makes predicting future cash flows difficult 
since  the company has focused on growing its core businesses of email encryption and e prescribing and reducing its operating expenses structure when compared to prior years 
both of these strategies were aimed at enabling the company to become cash flow break even in the near term 
these initiatives have continued into and the company concluded calendar year with no short term or long term indebtedness for borrowed monies 
the company has total contractual obligations over the next year of  and  over the next three years consisting of various office lease contracts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash usage in excess of these commitments represents operating spending to satisfy existing customer contracts and cover various corporate overhead costs  as well as investments that the company chooses to make to secure new orders 
the company believes that a significant portion of the spending in excess of contractual commitments is discretionary and flexible 
the company is engaged in two primary markets email encryption and e prescribing 
both are subscription businesses that share a common business model 
first  the service is established and maintained  which requires a start up cost and recurring fixed costs 
subscribers are then acquired and brought onto the service  which requires a variable acquisition cost of selling and marketing  installation and deployment 
subscribers are recruited with the goal of reaching a level of subscriber payments that exceeds the fixed recurring service costs 
therefore  both the rate at which new subscribers are added and the ability to retain subscribers is essential to operational cash flow breakeven 
operationally  the future cash flow of the company is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the email encryption service  renewal rates for the email encryption service  additional payor sponsorship of the e prescribing service to physicians by new or existing insurance payors  successful adoption and usage of the e prescribing service by physicians  retention of the users physicians of the e prescribing service as indicated by subscription renewals  future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the e prescribing service  and our ability to increase business volume with reasonable cost increases 
email encryption the recurring nature of the email encryption subscription model makes cash receipts naturally rise in a predictable manner assuming adequate subscription renewal and continued new additions to the subscription base 
adding to the predictability is the company s model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts for email encryption with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
in and  cash receipts from email encryption operations exceeded cash expenses attributable to email encryption 
the company achieved the cash flow positive state by keeping costs relatively flat while continuing to book new first year orders approximately  in and  in  as well as maintaining a high 
table of contents customer renewal rate of existing customers whose initial contracted service period had expired 
this rate has consistently remained above for years  and the company expects the email encryption business to continue generating cash receipts in excess of its specific operating costs in and beyond assuming continued addition of new subscribers at historical rates and maintaining consistent subscriber renewal rates 
e prescribing the e prescribing service and corresponding market is significantly earlier in its development phase when compared to email encryption  thus  the company has chosen to spend money in excess of the cash receipts to build an e prescribing subscription base with the target of reaching a level of subscribers required to overcome the spending needed to profitably provide the service 
the company currently estimates a range of  to  active users subscribers are needed for these fixed costs to be overcome 
at the end of  the company had eight insurance payors under contract 
the company is currently staffed to deploy in excess of units per quarter and has a backlog of approximately sponsored  but not yet deployed units  which is less than the company s backlog of  units at december  in  the company deployed approximately  units 
however  not all users to whom the e prescribing service is deployed become active 
based on current trends  the company believes that between of the users deployed in will ultimately become active users 
as of december   the company had approximately  active prescribers using the service 
additionally  the company continues to experience some attrition in its deployed and active user base 
as a result of these experiences  the company continues to review and target changes to its contracts  recruiting and training strategy in an effort to increase active rates 
most prescriber user contracts renew on an annual basis 
further  the company s payor contracts typically specify that individual physicians using the e prescribing service assume responsibility for renewing the service after the first year 
however  blue cross and blue shield of massachusetts has renewed the service for their qualified active users for a fourth year  and six of the company s other seven payors have also agreed to pay for some or all of the subscription fee for active users 
the sponsorship associated with the remaining payor  united healthcare services  inc  was signed in the second half of  and their deployed users are not yet due to renew 
for those users that do not meet the required activity level for continued sponsorship by their particular payor  the company attempts to contract directly with the individual user or medical practice 
the number of active users required to cover both fixed and variable costs for the e prescribing business will be strongly influenced by the volume of electronic prescriptions written and the success in negotiating additional and maintaining existing transaction based fee structures 
the total transaction and usage based fees recognized as revenue during were  compared to  in the company has a contract with a payor that provides for a shared savings arrangement measured by improvement in physician user prescribing behavior 
the company has also signed four contracts with transaction based fees or the equivalent with existing and new healthcare payors 
while increasing the number of active users should increase the prescriptions written and thus increase the potential for transaction fees under current agreements  substantial revenue increases from transaction fees will require additional transaction based fees from new and existing customers 
the company is now focused on securing new transaction fees from existing and new payor customers that sponsor e prescribing programs  as well as other non sponsoring payors that have insured members visiting doctors that already use the pocketscript service via a sponsorship arrangement from another competing payor 
in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and those additional non sponsorship payors are viewed as potential sources for supplemental fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
finally  possible sources for further transaction fees include parties who could benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
for example  the company is piloting a disease management program with one of its payors which alerts physicians through the e prescribing service that a patient may be eligible for enrollment 
in the future  disease management companies might be a source of additional fees 
additionally  the company currently has contracts under which it earns fees for sending prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to pharmacy benefit managers pbm 
the company continues to closely monitor developments in the e prescribing market and will adjust spending in that area commensurate with expected future returns 
the extent and timing of the company s success or lack thereof in the e prescribing market will have significant impact on liquidity 
the extent to which the company views the e prescribing market as attractive for investment will determine the company s willingness to fund additional operational cash losses if required 
the company believes it has the ability to adjust overall cash spending to react to shortfalls in projected cash 

table of contents sources and uses of cash summary ending cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on december   were  versus  on december  these balances exclude restricted cash of  at december   and  at december  the restricted cash is not available for operations because of restrictions placed on that cash and resulting from a single placement of cash in a collateral account used to secure one of the company s operating leases

cash flow from operations is a management measurement computed from total cash receipts minus cost of revenues and direct costs  but excluding total unallocated expense income 
email encryption has seen year on year improvement in cash flow because of continued growth in new subscriptions and its high rate of customer renewals 
the company anticipates that year on year email encryption cash flow improvement should continue as long as new subscriptions and the rate of customer renewals are sustained 
the emerging nature of the e prescribing market makes the expected cash usage for the company s e prescribing service in the next twelve months less predictable 
improved cash utilization for the e prescribing service is dependent upon securing new or the expansion of existing payor sponsorships  experiencing adequate renewal rates of existing users and increasing the sources of cash from transaction and performance based fees 
as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash flows used by investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of  for the comparable period in of these respective yearly totals   and  were used to purchase various computing equipment primarily to satisfy customer contracts

cash sources the following items are essential to the company s future operating cash sources contractual backlog email encryption growth and retention e prescribing growth and retention e prescribing transaction and performance based fees backlog the company s end user order backlog of  is comprised of contractually bound customer agreements that are expected to be amortized into revenue as services are provided in the future 
the majority of these contracts are time based subscription contracts with billings in advance of annual service periods 
most customers elect to commit to multiple years of service and are invoiced annually 
the backlog is comprised of  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid and  that has either not yet been billed or has been billed  and not collected in cash as of december  the company estimates that approximately half of the amount not yet billed will be billed in the next twelve months

the company believes that the anticipated increase in cash receipts can be achieved with minimal additional costs 
e prescribing growth and retention the company s go to market model in e prescribing has been to contract with healthcare payors who pay the company to provide service to physicians for at least one year 
the company continues to believe this model is the most cost effective method of pursuing the market at this time 
the company has demonstrated selling and deployment success with this model with eight major insurance payors 
the company s current list price for the first year of the service is  which includes twelve months of service as well as set up fees  and a per year fee for service in subsequent years 
the company currently has a usage based arrangement with one of its payors that provides for the payment of fees to the company based on achievement of measured improvements in prescribing behavior 
in light of the relatively low margins on installation and service during the initial year of deployment  the company s ability to promote high utilization rates for each prescriber  and thus  to increase the likelihood of renewals and the generation of transaction fees  is a key aspect of the company s cash flow breakeven plan for its e prescribing business 
e prescribing transaction and performance based fees the company s go to market model in e prescribing also involves securing additional contracts where customers pay for various transactions that occur through the e prescribing service 
for example  the company has signed four contracts with transaction based fees or the equivalent with existing and new healthcare payors 
the company also has a contract with a payor that provides for a shared savings payment arrangement measured by improvements in prescribing behavior 
further  in most cases  there are multiple healthcare payors in each market and those additional non sponsorship payors are viewed as potential sources for additional fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting

the number of prescriptions written using the pocketscript service and thus transmitted through the zixdata center has been growing on a year over year basis 
in  the company transacted approximately  prescriptions compared to  prescriptions in the company is investing greater sales effort and post deployment attention to maximizing utilization in order to maximize future revenue potential both through renewals and transaction fees 
securing further transaction and performance based revenue streams in excess of those currently under contract will be required so that the previously discussed targeted range of  to  active physician will provide returns in excess of fixed costs of providing the e prescribing service 
cash requirements the company goal over the next twelve months is to achieve net cash flow break even from operations 
however  unforeseen opportunities in the markets we serve  could call for increased investments delaying this cash flow breakeven point 
the company s cash requirements consist principally of the company s contractual commitments  funding its relatively flat operating cost structure  capital expenditures  and any new contractual commitments 
capital expenditures involve primarily computer equipment to support new email encryption customer orders and  over time  ongoing refurbishment of the data center and customer located email encryption computer equipment 
the company s cash requirements beyond contractual commitments are primarily aimed at continued investment in the e prescribing business for both research and development and working capital requirements 
the company has acquisition costs associated with adding subscribers to both the email encryption and e prescribing services 
for email encryption  the costs are primarily selling and marketing  while for e prescribing the costs are primarily recruitment and deployment related  including hardware device costs 
in the first year of the service  the company generally targets fees from the payor customer that cover the majority of the incremental acquisition costs 
after the first year of service  different fee structures come into play and the incremental cost to support customers decreases significantly 
specifically  the fee structure in the second year of the contract and beyond consists of an annual subscription fee and transaction fees or the equivalent from various sources 
the eprescribing business model requires that the combination of the annual subscription fee and the transaction fees or the equivalent significantly exceed the customer support expense in the second and subsequent years of service to a prescriber 
to the extent that these fees exceed the customer support expense in the second and subsequent years of service  eprescribing related fixed costs will be offset and profitability will be achieved 
it should be noted that net cash contributions from transaction based fees are high relative to the incremental costs to generate these fees 
in  the company deployed the e prescribing service to approximately  prescribers for a quarterly average of approximately deployments 
future quarters with deployments greater than these quantities will equate to greater variable costs  the major of which will be offset in the first year of the service with greater cash receipts from the sponsors 
conversely  lower deployments would result in lower variable costs and lower cash receipts 
the company is projecting its operating spending to be approximately  inclusive of capital equipment purchases for the next twelve months from december  this projection is based on the company s organization size after taking into account forecasted order and deployment rates and the annualized operating spending level 
as noted earlier  if unforeseen market opportunities materialize  the company may revise its projected spending level as a result of management s election to invest to capitalize on these opportunities 

table of contents liquidity summary based on cash flow projections  supported by low contractual future spending commitments  historically high customer renewals and continued growth in the email encryption service consistent with past rates  cost containment ability in the emerging area of e prescribing  general flexibility in discretionary spending  and total cash on hand  the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for the next twelve months 
on december   the total for cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash equaled  the company s goal is to be cash flow positive for the six month period ending june  for the balance of  the company s ability to achieve cash flow break even from operations depends on whether business opportunities arise which require the company to invest working capital resources in one or more lines of business 
for example  management may elect to increase its research and development spending to fund new functionality and services 
also  a significant increase in newly contracted deployments for the e prescribing service  beyond those deployment levels already forecasted  could increase the spending rate in because of the significant  upfront variable costs associated with establishing the service for new subscribers 
the company has in the past expressed a lack of willingness  relative to other alternatives  to raise capital by issuing new shares of common stock given the recent low price of the company s common stock 
in light of the more recent increased price of the company s common stock  the company may entertain raising capital for the purpose of funding new product or service development requirements and working capital requirements needed to fund any significant increase in newly contracted deployments for the e prescribing service  beyond those deployment levels already forecasted 
there are no assurances that the company will ultimately achieve or achieve in a timely manner its desired improvements in liquidity 
should business results not occur as projected  the company may not achieve its cash flow projections 
as a result  it would have to alter its business plan or further augment its cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings as mentioned above or a combination of these actions to achieve its december   total cash goal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in carrying out any of these measures should they become necessary 
options and warrants of zixcorp common stock the company has significant warrants and options outstanding that are currently vested 
there is no assurance that any of these options and warrants will be exercised  therefore the extent of future cash inflow from additional warrant and option activity is not certain 
the following table summarizes the warrants and options that are outstanding as of december  the vested shares are a subset of the outstanding shares 
the value of the shares is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share

accordingly  the company s adoption of this standard on january   is limited to financial assets and liabilities 
the company does not believe the initial adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  zixcorp is still in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet determined the impact that it will have on the company s financial statements upon full adoption
