risk factors 
overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership our operating partnership 
we operate as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey 
we were formed on april  and completed our initial public offering on august  at december   our portfolio consisted of properties  which included buildings with an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space including our construction in progress and land parcel properties 
we owned eight undeveloped land parcels adjacent to our existing properties that we estimate can support up to million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space 
we also had five properties under construction representing approximately million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space 
factors which may influence future operations our corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   our operating portfolio was leased to tenants 
leases representing approximately of our rentable square footage expire during and leases representing approximately of our rentable square footage expire during our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing currently vacant space and negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
we also intend to proceed with additional new developments  as real estate market conditions permit 
redevelopment development properties we are actively engaged in the redevelopment and development of certain properties in our portfolio 
we believe that these activities will ultimately result in a return on our additional investment once the redevelopment and development activities have been completed and the properties are leased 
however  redevelopment and development activities involve inherent risks and assumptions relating to our ability to fully lease the properties 
our expectation is that these properties will be fully leased upon completion of the construction activities 
however  our ability to fully lease the properties may be adversely affected by changing market conditions  including periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for life science office and laboratory space  local oversupply of real estate assets  or competition from others  which may diminish our opportunities for leasing the property on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may fail to retain tenants that have pre leased our properties  or may face significant monetary penalties  if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications 
further  our competitors with greater resources may have more flexibility that we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants to their properties  which could put pressure on our ability to attract tenants at rental rates that will provide an expected return on our additional 
table of contents investment in these properties 
as a result  we may be unable to fully lease some of our redevelopment development properties in a timely manner upon the completion of major construction activities 
we also rely on external sources of debt and equity funding to provide capital for our redevelopment and development projects 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient borrowing capacity and will be able to obtain additional funding as necessary  we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all or we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  which may require us to adjust our business and construction plans accordingly 
further  we may spend more time or money than anticipated to redevelop or develop our properties due to delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations or other unanticipated delays in the construction

a project is considered substantially complete and held available for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activities 
we currently estimate that we will invest up to an additional million before the redevelopment on these properties is substantially complete 
includes  square feet leased to our operating partnership for use as our corporate headquarters 
no revenue will be recognized with respect to this related party lease 
we anticipate that the property will be vacant upon the expiration of the remaining lease in the first quarter of the following summarizes our consolidated properties under development at december  estimated estimated estimated rentable percent investment total in service property square feet pre leased to date investment date dollars in thousands center for life science boston    q fairview avenue    q landmark at eastview    q towne centre drive    q total weighted average our estimate of the time in which development will be substantially complete 
a project is considered substantially complete and held available for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activities 
we own a membership interest in the limited liability company that owns this property 
we are currently developing a portion of our landmark at eastview property 
however  we have not separated this previously undeveloped portion into a separate property for legal and accounting purposes 
therefore  we still classify the landmark at eastview property as a stabilized property although it is also included in our discussion of development properties 

table of contents lease expirations the following is a summary of lease expirations over the next ten calendar years for leases in place at december  this table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights  if any  at or prior to the scheduled expirations rentable percent of annualized square total rentable percent of base rent feet of square feet of annualized annualized per leased expiring expiring base rent base rent square foot year of lease expiration leases leases current current current in thousands thereafter total portfolio weighted average includes current month to month leases 
the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania  new york new jersey and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years ground lease term of the related lease tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income 
if expected useful lives of our investments in real estate were shortened  we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period  resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis 
management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities acquired 
the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase cost of the acquired properties would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  buildings  and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements are recorded based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to a the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  b the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes and insurance  and c the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period 
the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be written off 
costs incurred in connection with the acquisition  development or construction of properties and improvements are capitalized 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other direct costs incurred during the period of development 
we capitalize costs on land and buildings under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 
capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful acquisitions are charged to expense when an acquisition is no longer considered probable 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 

table of contents when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long term  if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
revenue recognition we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduce revenue recognized over the term of the lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retain legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
existing leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired property 
an identifiable lease intangible asset or liability is recorded based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in 
table of contents place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases and any fixed rate renewal periods based on our assessment of the likelihood that the renewal periods will be exercised 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off 
substantially all rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs are recoverable from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements 
amounts recovered are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
tenant recovery revenue is recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues tax force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross  as the company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled  collectibility is assured  and we have no continuing obligation to provide space to former tenants 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent and tenant recovery payments or defaults 
we may also maintain an allowance for accrued straight line rents and amounts due from lease terminations based on our assessment of the collectibility of the balance 
payments received under master lease agreements entered into with the sellers of properties to lease space that was not producing rent at the time of the acquisition are recorded as a reduction to buildings and improvements rather than as rental income in accordance with eitf  recognition of receipts from made up rental shortfalls 
investments in partnerships we evaluate our investments in limited liability companies and partnerships under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities and the determination of which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity the primary beneficiary 
generally  fin r applies when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
if fin r does not apply  we consider eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
eitf states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
if the criteria in eitf are met  the consolidation of the partnership or limited liability company is required 

table of contents except for investments that are consolidated in accordance with fin r or eitf  we account for investments in entities over which we exercise significant influence  but do not control  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity in the investment is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and our share of net income or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income 
on a periodic basis  we assess whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in partnerships or limited liability companies may be impaired on a more than temporary basis 
an investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment on a more than temporary basis 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
derivative instruments we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during and  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and future variability in the interest related cash flows from forecasted issuances of debt 
we formally document the hedging relationships for all derivative instruments  account for all of our interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  and do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes
