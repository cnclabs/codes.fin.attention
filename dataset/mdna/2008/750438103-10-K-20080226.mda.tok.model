item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
this md a section discusses our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition  risk management practices  critical accounting policies  and estimates and certain factors that may affect our future results  including economic and industry wide factors 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  included in this annual report on form k  as well as the risk factors set forth in item a above 
subsequent to the end of  we determined that we should revise the classification of certain expenses relating to merchandise acquisition and the operation of our distribution centers  including depreciation  in our consolidated statements of income 
this revision had no impact on previously reported operating income  net income  financial position  stockholder s equity  comprehensive income  or cash flows from operating activities 
our policy is  and historically has been  to capitalize such amounts into inventory 
however  historically upon capitalization of these expenses  we increased inventory and previously decreased cost of products sold  rather than decreasing selling  general and administrative sg a expense where these expenses were originally recorded 
as a result  we had understated cost of products sold and overstated sg a expense and  to a lesser extent  depreciation 
we believe the revised presentation provides consistency between our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income by aligning the classification of our distribution costs within our statements of income in the manner in which these costs are included in our inventory balance

note summary of significant accounting policies under the section titled revision of expense classification in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion regarding the revision 
the following discussion and analysis has been updated to reflect this revision

comparable store sales decreased 
this decline was primarily due to a sales decrease in our wireless and personal electronics platforms 
gross margin increased basis points to compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to improved inventory management and a shift in our product mix 
sg a expense decreased million to  million  compared to the corresponding prior year period 
as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues  sg a declined basis points to 
a significant portion of this improvement was attributable to decreased compensation as a result of reductions in our corporate and store personnel in and better management of store labor hours 
other factors leading to the decline of sg a included a decrase in professional fees driven by reduced legal costs related to our defense of certain class action lawsuits during  as well as a reduction in the use of consultants

during the summer of  we also focused on our top performing stores and completed the closure of underperforming stores  reducing the number of retail employees in connection with these closures 
additionally  we consolidated our distribution centers in the fall of management also reduced our cost structure  including our advertising spend rate and our workforce within our corporate headquarters 
a number of other cost reductions were implemented

this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in postpaid wireless sales for our two main wireless carriers 
we believe that these sales declines were the result of increased wireless competition  a challenging wireless industry environment  and a shift to prepaid handsets and corresponding service plans 
this decrease  however  was partially offset by increased sales of gps products  particularly in the fourth quarter of  and prepaid wireless handset sales 
including the effects of the store closures  wireless platform sales for the year ended december   decreased

depreciation and amortization the table below gives a summary of our total depreciation and amortization by segment 
year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other unallocated total depreciation and amortization amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current year presentations 
certain prior year amounts have been reallocated between the segments and other business activities and the unallocated category 
the table below provides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization 
year ended december  in millions depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization included in cost of products sold total depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   declined million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the closure of stores and acceleration of depreciation as part of our restructuring  as well as a reduction in our capital expenditures during additionally  the decline within the kiosk segment was the result of an impairment recorded during the third quarter of impairment of long lived assets and other charges during  we recorded impairment charges for long lived assets related primarily to our sprint nextel kiosk operations and company operated stores of million 
this charge was comprised of million  million  million and million recorded in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
we recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
it was determined that the net book value of many of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
for a complete discussion on the impairment  see the subsection titled impairment of long lived assets and other charges below  under the section titled compared to of md a 
these impairment charges  aggregating million and million  respectively  for and were recorded within impairment of long lived assets and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 

table of contents net interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average outstanding debt  which was partially offset by rising interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure 
interest income increased to million in from million in this increase was due to a higher average investment balance for  as well as higher average investment rates 
additionally  we recorded million of interest income related to federal telecommunications excise tax refunds during see 
note federal excise tax for a discussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excise tax 
we anticipate net interest expense for will be below the level  due to larger average cash balances when compared to the prior year 
other income loss for the year ended december   we recognized a net gain of million relating to our derivative exposure to sirius 
during the third quarter of  we modified the expected date at which we would settle the warrants  resulting in a million unrealized gain  which was offset by mark to market losses of million during the year  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  additionally  for the year ended december   we had a million loss related to an other than temporary impairment of other investments 
income tax provision the income tax provision for each quarterly period reflects our current estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year  adjusted for any discrete events that are reported in the quarterly period in which they occur 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the corresponding prior year period 
the effective tax rate was impacted by the net reversal in june of approximately million in unrecognized tax benefits  deferred tax assets and accrued interest 
refer to 
note income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this million reversal lowered our effective tax rate basis points for the year ended december  furthermore  the effective tax rate for was primarily affected by the tax benefit associated with inventory donations occurring in the quarter ended june  during the second quarter of  we donated approximately million in inventory to charitable organizations in a manner that provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost 
the entire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction is reflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter of compared with results of operations net sales and operating revenues sales decreased to  million in from  million in we also had a decrease in comparable store sales 
these changes were primarily the result of a decrease in our service platform sales due primarily to the manner in which we began recognizing sales of prepaid wireless airtime in and a decrease in our wireless platform sales 
in addition  all platforms were affected by the decline in the number of radioshack company operated stores as a result of our restructuring program 

table of contents radioshack company operated stores all sales in the platforms below were impacted by the closure of the radioshack company operated stores related to our restructuring program 
sales in our wireless platform decreased in dollars  but increased as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily driven by a decline in unit sales of wireless handsets 
factors contributing to this sales decline included an unfavorable mix shift to prepaid handsets from postpaid  a sluggish wireless industry environment  a sharp unit sales decline in the northeastern united states  and fewer radioshack stores 
these decreases were partially offset by the introduction of various gps products 
sales in our accessory platform increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these increases were primarily the result of higher sales of digital music accessories associated with higher sales of digital music players included in our personal electronics platform  in addition to higher bluetooth wireless accessories and flash memory sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in home entertainment accessory sales 
sales in our personal electronics platform increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these sales increases were driven primarily by increased sales of digital music players  offset by decreases in most of the remaining personal electronics categories 
sales in our modern home platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily due to lower sales of telephones  home computers  and dvd players  which were partially offset by increased sales of flat panel televisions 
sales in our power platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these sales decreases were due primarily to a decrease in sales of both general and special purpose batteries caused by factors such as reduced sales of products requiring batteries and customer tendencies to simply replace older cordless phones rather than replacing their batteries 
sales in our technical platform decreased in dollars  but increased slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to the dollar decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of specialty tools 
sales in our service platform decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily attributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime 
beginning in  principally as a result of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers  we no longer record the full value of airtime purchased by customers  but rather record only our markup on the sale as revenue 
this change reduced our total company operated stores revenue by approximately million for  as compared to the corresponding prior year period  but had no impact on our gross profit or operating income 
other revenue decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues  due primarily to our store closures and  to a lesser extent  a decline in store repair revenue 
kiosks kiosk sales increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of sprint nextel kiosks in late that operated for all of 
table of contents other sales other sales were up million for  or an increase of  when compared to these sales increases were primarily due to an increase in sales to our network of independent dealers and an increase in web site sales 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of five service centers  which we sold or closed in gross profit consolidated gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of a decrease in net sales and operating revenues  the impact of inventory liquidation related to the store closures involved in the restructuring program  a mix change toward lower gross margin products  including higher relative sales of wireless prepaid and upgrade handsets and lower margin accessories  and more aggressive promotional activity 
the gross margin rate was positively affected by the change in the manner in which we began recognizing income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime in  as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expense our consolidated sg a expense increased slightly in dollars and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the dollar increase for was primarily due to an increase in payroll and commissions  plus rent expense  this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in advertising expense 
however  headcount reductions from store closures  service center closures and corporate headquarters reductions helped lower compensation expense excluding the severance charges in the third and fourth quarters of payroll and commissions expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
these increases were primarily the result of pay plan changes for radioshack company operated stores initiated in early  severance related to our restructuring program  utilization of more labor hours in our company operated stores during the first half of the year  and increased headcount in our kiosk operations 
we also began the required expensing of stock options as of january   which increased compensation expense by million  when compared to rent expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
the rent increase was primarily driven by a full year of rental payments on our corporate campus  as well as the addition of kiosk locations  which was partially offset by store closures 
advertising expense decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
this decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy  as we changed the mix of media used in our advertising program from television to more radio and newspaper usage  as well as reduced sponsorship programs 
professional fees increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
the increase relates to the defense costs for certain class action lawsuits  including million of the million discussed under 
note litigation to our notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as the cost of consultants engaged in various projects 
depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization increased million to million and increased to of net sales and operating revenues  compared to for the increase in depreciation was primarily attributable to our new corporate headquarters  increased spending for our store remodel program  information system projects  and the amortization of intangibles related to our sam s club kiosk business 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and other charges in february  as part of our restructuring program  our board of directors approved the closure of to radioshack company operated stores 
during the first half of  we identified the stores for closure and subsequently performed the impairment test 
based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores  it was determined that the net book value of some of the stores long lived assets to be held for use was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss related to our radioshack company operated store segment 
by july   we had closed specific stores under the restructuring program  there were no additional closures under this program for the remainder of the year 
also  we purchased certain assets from wireless retail  inc during the fourth quarter of for million  which resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and a million intangible asset related to a five year agreement with sam s club to operate wireless kiosks in approximately sam s club locations nationwide 
these assets relate to our kiosk segment 
as a result of continued company and wireless industry growth challenges  together with changes in our senior leadership team during the third quarter of that resulted in a refocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of our business  we determined that our long lived assets  including goodwill associated with our kiosk operations  were impaired 
we performed impairment tests on both the long lived assets associated with our sam s club agreement  including the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement  and the accompanying goodwill 
with respect to the long lived tangible and intangible assets  we compared their carrying values with their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model  which reflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceased expansion of our kiosk business  and determined that the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement was impaired 
this assessment resulted in a million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosk segment in the remaining intangible balance will be amortized over the remaining life of the sam s club agreement  which is scheduled to expire in september the balance at december   was million 
with respect to the goodwill of million  we estimated the fair value of the sam s club reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in the long lived asset impairment test 
we compared it with the carrying value of the reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired 
as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value  we then compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
this resulted in an million impairment of goodwill related to our kiosk segment in additionally  based on historical and expected cash flows for company operated stores and kiosks  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment and an impairment charge of million related to goodwill 
these impairment charges  aggregating million  were recorded within impairment of long lived assets and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
net interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased slightly to million in from million in this decrease in the interest expense during was attributable to lower average outstanding debt  which was partially offset by rising interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure 
interest income increased to million in from million in these changes were due to a higher average investment balance for  as well as increases in investment rates 

table of contents other income loss for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million in other income loss 
this loss included million relating to our derivative exposure to sirius warrants  which was a result of the required mark to market accounting treatment of these warrants 
the additional million related to an other than temporary impairment of other investments 
during the first quarter of  we sold all rights  title and interest to the tandy name within australia and new zealand to an affiliate of dick smith electronics  an australia based consumer electronics retailer 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million in other income in income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for  and for the fluctuation in the effective tax rate during was due primarily to the tax benefit associated with inventory donations occurring in the quarter ended june  during the second quarter of  we donated approximately million in inventory to charitable organizations in a manner that provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost 
the entire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction is reflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter 
the lower effective tax rate in was principally due to a favorable non cash income tax benefit of million relating to the release of a tax contingency reserve upon the expiration of the associated statute of limitations 
this reserve related to losses sustained in connection with our european operations  which were fully dissolved by the release of the reserve occurred in the third quarter of because the statute of limitations governing these issues expired on september  recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to

cash flow and liquidity a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below

cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by net income plus non cash adjustments to net income was million in compared to million in the increase was due to an increase in operating income in  compared to the prior year 
cash provided by working capital components was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents cash flow investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  while million in cash was provided in the decrease was primarily the result of reduced capital spending during capital expenditures for these periods related primarily to retail stores and information systems projects 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our corporate campus during the fourth quarter of we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will range from million to million 
radioshack company operated store remodels and relocations  as well as information systems updates  will account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and  when necessary  from our credit facilities  are available to fund future capital expenditure needs 
cash flow financing activities cash used in financing activities was million and million for and  respectively  compared to cash provided of million in we used cash of million to repurchase our common stock during  however  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the stock repurchases were partially funded by million received from stock option exercises 
the balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations 
additionally  we paid off our million ten year unsecured note payable which matured on september  free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  million in and million in the consecutive increases in free cash flow were the result of a decrease in cash used by working capital components  primarily inventory  as well as a decrease in capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which was million in  million in and million in we do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap

during the third quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an underlying notional amount of million and a maturity in september this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the maturity of the note payable 
in june and august  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  and maturities in may these swaps effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
we entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short term interest rates 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of libor plus a markup  and to receive a fixed rate of for the swap entered into in  and for the swaps entered into in we have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
we recorded an amount in other non current liabilities  net  of million and million their fair value at december  and  respectively  for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount

as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities  nor were these facilities utilized during interest charges under these facilities are derived using a base libor rate plus a margin which changes based on our credit ratings 
our bank syndicated credit facilities have customary terms and covenants  and we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in june  we replaced our existing million five year credit facility  which was to expire in june  with a million five year credit agreement expiring may the new facility has a more favorable fixed charge coverage ratio and provides for the exclusion of cash restructuring expenses from the covenant calculation 
we also amended the million facility expiring in june to include similar covenants and terminated our million day revolving credit facility 
we believe that our present ability to borrow is adequate for our business needs 
however  if market conditions change  gross profit were to dramatically decline  or we could not control operating costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings further  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a further reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  dollars in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization current debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization our debt to total capitalization ratio decreased in from  due primarily to a million decrease in total debt primarily related to the repayment of our medium term notes payable in september dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for consecutive years

during march  management resumed share repurchases under the million program  however  no shares were repurchased during the second and fourth quarters of for the twelve months ended december   we repurchased million shares or million of our common stock 
as of december   there was million available for share repurchases under the million share repurchase program 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings may be utilized to fund the inventory buildup as described in available financing above

table of contents contractual and credit commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations that were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relates to various lease obligations arising from leases assigned to compusa  inc compusa as part of the sale of our computer city  inc subsidiary to compusa in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  the lessors of such locations may seek to recover the unpaid rent from us 
on february   compusa announced a comprehensive realignment strategy to improve its financial status 
according to their press release  the realignment included a million cash infusion  closure of stores  major expense reductions and a corporate restructuring 
a portion of the store closures represents locations where we may be liable for the rent payments on the underlying lease 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we received notices from two lessors seeking payment from us as a result of compusa being in default for non payment of rent 
compusa has also informed us that there are an additional leases on which compusa has ceased making rent payments 
compusa reported on december   that they were acquired by the gordon brothers group 
compusa stores ceased operations in january djm realty  a division of gordon brothers group  is currently in discussions with its lessors in an effort to negotiate a satisfactory fulfillment of their legal obligation under these leases 
based on all available information pertaining to the status of these leases  and after applying the provisions set forth within sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and fin  reasonable estimation of a loss  an interpretation of sfas no 
 during the fourth quarter of  we established an accrual of million  recorded in current liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that a change in our estimate of our probable liability could occur in the near term 
we are continuing to monitor this situation and will update as necessary as more information becomes available 
financial impact of restructuring program as discussed previously  our restructuring program  as originally stated in february  contained four key components update our inventory focus on our top performing radioshack company operated stores  while closing to radioshack company operated stores and aggressively relocate other radioshack company operated stores consolidate our distribution centers reduce our overhead costs store closures as of december   we had closed stores as a result of our restructuring program 
our decision to close these stores was made on a store by store basis  and there was no geographic concentration of closings for these stores 
for these closed stores  we recognized a charge in of million to sg a for future lease obligations and negotiated buy outs with landlords 
a lease obligation reserve is not recognized until a store has been closed or when a buy out agreement has been reached with the landlord 
regarding the stores we closed as a result of the restructuring program during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets associated with certain of these stores 
it was determined that the net book value of several of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
we also recognized million in accelerated depreciation associated with closed store assets for which the useful lives had been changed due to the store closures 

table of contents in connection with these store closures  we identified retail employees whose positions were terminated by december  these employees were paid severance  and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed until certain agreed upon dates 
the development of a reserve for these costs began on the date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicated to the employees  and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retention period 
as of december   million had been recognized in sg a as retention and severance benefits for store employees  with million in benefits paid to date 
additionally  as part of our store closure activities  we incurred and recognized in sg a million in expenses in primarily in connection with fees paid to outside liquidators and for close out promotional activities for the stores 
all stores identified for closure under the restructuring program were closed as of july  additionally  we continue to negotiate buy out agreements with our landlords  however  remaining lease obligations of million still existed at december  there is uncertainty as to when  and at what cost  we will fully settle all remaining lease obligations 
distribution center consolidations we closed a distribution center located in southaven  mississippi  and sold a distribution center in charleston  south carolina  in during the year ended december   we recognized a lease obligation charge in sg a in the amount of million on the lease of the southaven distribution center and a gain of million on the sale of the charleston distribution center 
we also incurred a million charge related to severance for approximately employees 
additionally  there were million in other expenses 
service center operations we closed or sold five service center locations during the year ended december   resulting in the elimination of approximately positions 
we recognized charges to sg a of million and million related to lease obligations and severance  respectively 
this severance obligation was paid as of december  additionally  there were million in other expenses 
overhead cost reductions management conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost reductions 
in connection with this review  we made decisions to lower these costs  including reducing our advertising spend rate in connection with adjustments to our media mix 
during the year ended december   we reduced our workforce by approximately positions  primarily within our corporate headquarters 
we recorded charges to sg a for termination benefits and related costs of million  of which million had been paid as of december  during  severance payments totaling million were paid  leaving an accrued severance balance of million as of december  inventory update we have been replacing underperforming merchandise with new  faster moving merchandise 
we recorded a pre tax charge to cost of products sold of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  as a result of both our normal inventory review process and the inventory update aspect of our restructuring program

off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation with the exception of recent increases in energy costs  inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless international events substantially affect the global economy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation under the cost method  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of a reserve for estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider  while the residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
estimated product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
if actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory valuation our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost which approximates fifo or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the point of sale 
typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 

table of contents we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may arise above the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
effective january   we began recognizing uncertain income tax positions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likely than not to be sustained on audit  as set forth within fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
additionally  we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
a reserve has been established based on our best estimates of the potential liability in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as historical operating losses or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using our risk free rate of interest 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions that have occurred during prior years 
the original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates for future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
we review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset might exceed their current fair value 

table of contents the determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and other comparable market analyses 
these valuation techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are different from our estimates  we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill or intangible assets 
the total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at december   was million 
stock based compensation we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see 
note summary of significant accounting policies and 
note stock based incentive plans for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date that an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing the monte carlo simulation model 
the black scholes merton and monte carlo simulation models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected option life  expected volatility  and expected employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and the employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected our net income by approximately million 
prior to calendar year  we followed the guidance under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations

we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks were primarily the interest rate swaps noted in our md a and warrants we earned to acquire common stock of sirius 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of million 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investment balance 
our exposure to market risk  specifically the equity markets  relates to warrants we earned as of december  and  to purchase million and million shares  respectively  of sirius stock at an exercise price of per share 
we have recorded these as assets using a black scholes merton valuation method 
our maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value at december   of million 
we manage our portfolio of fixed rate exposures  compared to floating rate exposure  to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to long term interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would decrease million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
