item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this document 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
business we design and develop advanced digital wireless technologies for use in digital cellular and wireless ieee related products 
we actively participate in and contribute our technology solutions to worldwide organizations responsible for the development and approval of standards to which digital cellular and ieee compliant products are built  and our contributions are regularly incorporated into such standards 
we offer licenses to our patents to equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular and ieee related products 
in addition  we offer for license or sale our slimchip family of mobile broadband modem solutions which includes modem ip know how  baseband ics and reference platforms to mobile device manufacturers  semiconductor companies and other equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular 
we have built our suite of technology and patent offerings through independent development  joint development with other companies and selected acquisitions 
our goal is to derive revenue on every g mobile device sold  either in the form of patent licensing revenues  product related revenues  or a combination of these elements 
in recent years  our patent license agreements have contributed the majority of our cash flow and revenues 
as of december  we recorded patent royalties on approximately one third of all g mobile devices sold worldwide 
in addition  our technology product solutions offer an additional means to generate revenue from g mobile devices 
in  and our revenues were million  million and million  respectively and our recurring revenues were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in recurring revenues over the last two years is attributable to both an increase in the number of licensees and higher royalties from existing licensees  based on increased sales of covered g products 
industry overview our revenue and cash flows are dependent  in large part  on our licensees sales of wireless products 
over the course of the last ten years  the cellular communications industry has experienced rapid growth worldwide 
total worldwide cellular wireless communications subscribers rose from slightly more than million at the end of to approximately billion at the end of in several countries  mobile telephones now outnumber fixed line telephones 
market analysts expect that the aggregate number of global wireless subscribers could exceed billion in logo source strategy analytics  inc july data for through represents estimates of handset sales 
includes wcdma hspa  lte  and td scdma 
includes cdma and its evolutions  such as ev do 
includes gsm gprs edge and analog  iden  tdma  phs and pdc 
the growth in new cellular subscribers  combined with existing customers choosing to replace their mobile phones  helped fuel the growth of mobile phone sales from approximately million units in to over one billion units in we believe the combination of a broad subscriber base  continued technological change  and the growing dependence on the internet  e mail and other digital media sets the stage for continued growth in the sales of wireless products and services over the next five years 
for these same reasons  shipments of g enabled phones  which represented approximately of the market in  are predicted to increase to approximately of the market by moreover  recent advances in g technologies that support devices offering higher data rates have met with rapid consumer uptake 
in addition to the advances in digital cellular technologies  the industry has also made significant advances in non cellular wireless technologies 
in particular  ieee wlan has gained momentum in recent years as a wireless broadband solution in the home  office and in public areas 
ieee technology offers high speed data connectivity through unlicensed spectrum within a relatively modest operating range 
since its introduction in  semiconductor shipments of products built to the ieee standard have nearly doubled every year 
while relatively small compared to the cellular market approximately million ieee wireless ics shipped in  the affordability and attractiveness of the technology has helped fuel rapid market growth 
in addition  the ieee wireless standards bodies are creating sets of standards to enable higher data rates  provide coverage over longer distances and enable roaming 
these standards are establishing technical specifications for high data rates  such as ieee wimax as well as technology specifications to enable seamless handoff between different air interfaces ieee 
table of contents we have substantially replaced expired g patent license revenue the amortization of million of royalty payments associated with our g patent license agreement with nec corporation of japan nec was completed in february telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson and ericsson inc s ericsson obligation to pay royalties under its g g patent license agreement ceased after the recent remittance of its final fixed payment of million related to fourth quarter covered infrastructure sales 
sony ericsson mobile communications ab s sony ericsson obligation to pay royalties under its g g patent license agreement ended in first quarter together  these three g g licenses contributed approximately million or of our recurring revenue in and million or of recurring revenue in we do not expect to recognize any additional revenue in related to the above noted agreements with nec  ericsson and sony ericsson 
we continue to place substantial focus on both expanding our base of patent licensees and resolving our outstanding patent license litigation with samsung 
we also continue to seek customers for our technology products and solutions 
in  we 
table of contents concluded new agreements and amendments to existing agreements that  combined with growth from existing licensees  contributed revenue that more than offset the reductions noted above 
repurchase of common stock in our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
in october  our board of directors authorized a new million share repurchase program 
the company may repurchase shares under the programs through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans or privately negotiated purchases 
during we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for million 
at december   we accrued accounts payable of approximately million associated with our obligation to settle late december repurchases 
we completed the repurchase program in april through the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million 
under the october authorization  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for million 
at december   we accrued accounts payable of approximately million associated with our obligation to settle late december repurchases 
from january  through february   we repurchased an additional million shares for million bringing the cumulative repurchase totals to million shares at a cost of million under the current program 
under a previous repurchase program in  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
intellectual property rights enforcement from time to time  if we believe that a third party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain digital cellular products and such third party has not done so  we might institute legal action against the third party 
these legal actions typically take the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the us international trade commission 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our patent litigation and arbitration costs increased to million from million in this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
patent litigation and administration costs will vary depending upon activity levels and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 
development our investments in the development of advanced digital wireless technologies and related products include maintaining a highly specialized engineering team and providing that team with the equipment and advanced software platforms necessary to support the development of technologies 
over each of the last three years  our cost of development has ranged between and of our total operating expenses exclusive of non recurring contingency accruals and repositioning charges 
the largest portion of our cost of development has been personnel costs 
as of december   we employed engineers  of whom hold advanced degrees and of those hold phds 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others  are those relating to patents  contingencies  revenue recognition  compensation and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions had existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
patents we capitalize external costs  such as filing fees and associated attorneys fees  incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights 
we expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance 
we amortize capitalized patent costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents 
ten years represents our best estimate of the average useful life of our patents relating to technology developed directly by us 
the ten year estimated useful life of internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors as the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed  the overall makeup of the portfolio over time and the length of license agreements for such patents 
the estimated useful lives of 
table of contents acquired patents and patent rights  however  have been and will continue to be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents 
we assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patents portfolio may not be recoverable 
amortization expense related to capitalized patent costs was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had capitalized gross patent costs of million and million  respectively  which were offset by accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
our capitalized gross patent costs in included million of patents acquired from third parties 
the weighted average estimated useful life of our capitalized patent costs at december  and was years and years  respectively 
contingencies we recognize contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
in second quarter  we recorded a million charge to increase a million contingent liability to million 
subsequently we have accrued million of post judgment interest expense 
this accrual relates to an arbitration with federal over an insurance reimbursement agreement 
in fourth quarter  we accrued million for the potential reimbursement of legal fees associated with our ukii matter with nokia 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and multi faceted 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  and advanced payments and fees for service arrangements 
due to the combined nature of some agreements and the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may sometimes be recognized over the combined performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  the determining factors necessary to allocate revenue across past  current  and future years may be difficult to establish 
in such instances  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
generally  we will not recognize revenue or establish a receivable related to payments that are due greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we have no material future obligations associated with such licenses  other than  in some instances  to provide such licensees with notification of future license agreements pursuant to most favored licensee rights 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for prior sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue 
we may also receive consideration from the settlement of patent infringement litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
we record the consideration related to such litigation as other income 
fixed fee royalty payments up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement  for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement 
prepayments up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
we recognize revenues related to consideration for prior sales when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price and determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we have no future obligations under these licenses and we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
consideration for prior sales  the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
during  we recognized revenue of million related to unpaid patent licensee royalties 
we based our recognition of this revenue on royalty reports received  despite the fact that the licensee has expressed its belief that it does not have a current payment obligation 
we believe that we are entitled to these royalty payments and the eventual collection of these amounts is reasonably assured 
if we had determined that there was a reasonable chance that we would not collect these royalties  we would have recorded up to million less revenue in 
table of contents technology solutions revenue technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with the customer includes significant production  modification or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of sop on a straight line basis under staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred contract costs and total estimated contract costs 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded when the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
deferred charges from time to time  we use sales agents to assist us in our licensing activities 
we often pay a commission related to successfully negotiated license agreements 
the commission rate varies from agreement to agreement 
commissions are normally paid shortly after our receipt of cash payments associated with the patent license agreements 
we defer recognition of commission expense related to both prepayments and fixed fee royalty payments and amortize these expenses in proportion to our recognition of the related revenue 
in  and  we paid cash commissions of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and recognized commission expense of million  million  and million  respectively  as part of patent administration and licensing expense 
at december   and we had deferred commission expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  included within prepaid and other current assets and million  million and million  respectively  included within other non current assets 

table of contents compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees and more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  an annual bonus tied to performance goals  cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and a long term compensation program ltcp  covering managers  that includes rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
the ltcp was originally designed to include three year cycles that overlap by one year 
however  the first cycle under the program covered the period from april  through january  cycle 
the second cycle originally covered the period from january  through january  cycle 
in second quarter  the compensation committee of our board of directors amended the ltcp to revise the performance based cash award portion of cycle to cover a year period from july  through january  cycle a  and authorized a pro rated interim payment  of approximately million  related to first half the third rsu cycle rsu cycle began on january  and runs through january  the third performance based cash award cycle cash cycle began on january  and runs through january  we recognized million  million and million of compensation expense in  and  respectively  related to the performance based cash incentive under our ltcp  discussed below 
we also recognized share based compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the majority of the share based compensation expense  for all years  related to rsu awards granted to managers under our ltcp 
in  share based compensation expense also included a non recurring charge of million to correct our accounting related to share based grants awarded to two non employee  non director consultants in we previously accounted for these non employee grants similarly to share based employee grants  using the intrinsic value method 
the charge reflects the incremental cost that would have been recognized by correctly treating these grants as non employee grants using the fair value method 
due to the structure of the different cycles in the ltcp  we expect that expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive and rsus will be approximately million more than however  the amount recorded could either increase or decrease dependent upon both the number of employees that qualify for the ltcp and our future assessment of the expected attainment of pre established performance goals 
at december   accrued compensation expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive was based on an estimated payout for cycle a 
under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based cash incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of and no payout for performance that falls below of target results 
the following table provides examples of the performance based cash incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater if we had assumed that the company s cycle a goal achievement would be either or  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  however  our estimated accrual could either increase or decrease in the future dependent upon our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals 
during  fourteen members of our senior management voluntarily exchanged approximately  cycle time based rsus for an equal number of cycle performance based rsus 
the company ultimately satisfied these performance based rsus in early through the issuance of approximately  shares  based upon senior management s performance against specified goals 
during  the ltcp was amended such that  beginning with the january  grant  executives now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the amendment the company s managers now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based rsu incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of 
for performance that falls below of target  no share payout 
table of contents would occur 
the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater at december   we did not meet criteria specified by sfas no 
r to accrue performance based equity compensation associated with the cycle rsu grant 
if we had determined that we met such criteria  we would have accrued million of related compensation expense through december  we will establish an accrual for these performance rsus in the future if our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals meets certain criteria for performance based share compensation established by sfas no 
r 
in fourth quarter  we accelerated the vesting of all stock options which were scheduled to vest on or after january  as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock  which would otherwise have vested at various times over the next six years  became fully vested 
we recorded a charge of approximately million related to this acceleration 
the charge was based  in part  on our estimate that approximately of the accelerated options would have been forfeited had the acceleration not occurred 
the charge would have been approximately million if we had estimated that of the options would have been forfeited had the acceleration not occurred 
the acceleration eliminated a non cash charge of approximately million that would have been recognized under sfas no 
r share based payments between and we will continue to recognize expense for our remaining equity based incentive programs 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
effective january  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under fin the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as a result of the implementation  we recognized a million increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
this increase  related to federal tax credits  was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings on the balance sheet 
including this cumulative effect adjustment  on january  we had million of net federal tax benefits that  if recognized  would reduce our effective income tax rate in the period recognized 
prior to the adoption of fin  we accrued for tax contingencies that had met the probable and reasonably estimable criteria 
as of december  and  there are certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
based on judgments associated with determining the annual limitation applicable to us under internal revenue code section  we did not include all federal nol carryforwards in the computation of our gross deferred tax assets 
we also excluded a portion of the federal research and experimental credits that may be available to us from the computation of gross deferred tax assets based upon estimates of the final credit that may be realized 
had we included all federal nol carryforwards and research and experimental credits in the computation of gross deferred tax assets  the gross deferred tax assets at december  would have been approximately million greater and our income tax provision would have decreased by the same amount 
we recorded a fin reserve of approximately million during upon the utilization of these gross deferred tax assets 
in  we began to credit foreign source withholding tax payments against our us federal income tax liability 
prior to  we recognized deferred tax assets related to deferred revenue for both us federal income tax purposes and us jurisdictions that assess a source withholding tax on related royalty payments 
we expense these deferred tax assets as we recognize the revenue and the related temporary differences reverse 
between and we paid approximately million of foreign taxes 
during this period we were in a net operating loss position for us federal income tax purposes and elected to deduct these foreign tax payments as expenses on our us federal income tax returns rather than take them as foreign tax credits 
we elected this strategy because a we had no us cash tax obligations at the time and b net operating losses can be carried forward significantly longer than foreign tax credits 
we utilized most of our net operating losses in and began to generate u 
s cash tax obligations 
at that time  we began to treat our foreign tax payments as foreign tax credits on our us federal income tax return 
we are currently evaluating the possibility of amending our us federal income tax returns for the periods to determine if we are able to take the foreign tax payments we made during that period as foreign tax credits instead of deductions 
the process to amend these returns is complicated including aggregating information that was not previously required and may not be available and involves tax treaty competent authority procedures including both us and foreign tax authorities 
it is possible that we may be unable to establish a basis to support amending the returns  but it is estimated that a maximum benefit could be a refund claim of approximately million 
we can not yet predict the amount  if any  of potential refund and we do not anticipate being in a position to file any amended returns until  although it is possible that we could file amended returns sooner 
no benefit has been recorded for this contingent gain 

table of contents significant agreements and events repositioning in august  we announced plans to close our melbourne  florida design facility 
we ceased development activity at this facility in third quarter and relocated certain development efforts and personnel to other company locations 
we closed this facility in fourth quarter on the date of the announced closing  there were thirty three full or part time employees at this facility  of which five full time employees accepted offers of continued employment elsewhere within our organization 
we estimate the repositioning resulted in annual pre tax cost savings of approximately million 
in connection with the closure  we recognized repositioning charges totaling approximately million in  comprised of severance and relocation costs of million and facility closing costs of million 
the facility closing costs include lease termination costs  fixed asset writeoffs and costs to wind down the facility 
we believe that our financial obligations associated with this repositioning are complete 
acquisition of patents in  we acquired  for a purchase price of approximately million  selected patents  intellectual property blocks and related assets from an unrelated third party 
these assets are designed to improve the range  throughput and reliability of wireless lan and other wireless technology systems 
the purchase price was allocated almost entirely to patent assets with a nominal amount being allocated to other assets 
based on our assessment in connection with the asset acquisition  we are amortizing these patents over their expected useful lives of approximately years 
new accounting standards sfas no 
in september  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
for financial assets and liabilities  sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until january  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value in an attempt to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  we do not anticipate electing the sfas option for our existing financial assets and liabilities and therefore do not expect the adoption of sfas to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations which revised sfas no 
 business combinations 
this pronouncement is effective for us beginning january  under sfas no 
 organizations utilized the announcement date as the measurement date for the purchase price of the acquired entity 
sfas no 
r requires measurement at the date the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree  generally referred to as the acquisition date 
sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on the accounting for transaction costs  restructuring costs as well as the initial recognition of contingent assets and liabilities assumed during a business combination 
under sfas no 
r  adjustments to the acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position balances occurring outside the measurement period are recorded as a component of the income tax expense  rather than goodwill 
as the provisions of sfas no 
r are applied prospectively  the impact to the registrants cannot be determined until the transactions occur 

table of contents litigation and legal proceedings samsung and nokia us international trade commission proceedings and related delaware district court proceedings in march  interdigital  inc s wholly owned subsidiaries interdigital communications  llc and interdigital technology corporation collectively  the company  interdigital  we  or our filed a complaint against samsung electronics co 
ltd 
and certain of its affiliates collectively  samsung in the united states international trade commission usitc alleging that samsung engages in unfair trade practices by selling for importation  importing into the united states  and selling after importation certain g handsets and components that infringe three of interdigital s patents 
in may and december  a fourth patent and fifth patent  respectively  were added to our complaint against samsung 
the complaint against samsung seeks an exclusion order barring from entry into the us infringing g wcdma handsets and components that are imported by or on behalf of samsung 
our complaint also seeks a cease and desist order to bar sales of infringing nokia products that have already been imported into the united states 
in addition  on the same date as our filing of the samsung usitc action referenced above  we also filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware delaware district court alleging that samsung s g wcdma handsets infringe the same three interdigital patents identified in the original samsung usitc complaint 
the us trade laws provide for a mandatory stay of parallel district court proceedings at the request of a respondent 
in june  the delaware district court entered a stipulated order staying this delaware district court proceeding against samsung 
the stipulated order was agreed to by the parties 
the stipulated order stays the proceeding until the usitc s determination in this matter becomes final 
the delaware district court has permitted interdigital to add the fourth and fifth asserted patents asserted against samsung in the usitc action to this stayed delaware action 
in august  we filed a usitc complaint against nokia corporation and nokia  inc collectively  nokia alleging that nokia engaged in an unfair trade practice by making for importation into the united states  importing  and selling after importation certain g mobile handsets and components that infringe two of interdigital s patents 
in november and december  a third patent and fourth patent  respectively  were added to our complaint against nokia 
the complaint against nokia seeks an exclusion order barring from entry into the us infringing g mobile handsets and components that are imported by or on behalf of nokia 
our complaint also seeks a cease and desist order to bar further sales of infringing nokia products that have already been imported into the united states 
in addition  on the same date as our filing of the nokia usitc action referenced above  we also filed a complaint in the delaware district court alleging that nokia s g mobile handsets and components infringe the same two interdigital patents identified in the original nokia usitc complaint 
this delaware action was also stayed on january   pursuant to the mandatory  statutory stay of parallel district court proceedings at the request of a respondent in an itc investigation 
thus  this delaware action is stayed until the usitc s determination in this matter becomes final 
the delaware district court has permitted interdigital to add the third and fourth patents asserted against nokia in the usitc action to this stayed delaware action 
nokia  joined by samsung  moved to consolidate the samsung and nokia itc proceedings 
on october   the honorable paul j 
luckern  the administrative law judge overseeing the two usitc proceedings against samsung and nokia  respectively  issued an order to consolidate the two pending investigations 
pursuant to the order  the schedules for both investigations have been revised to consolidate proceedings and set a unified evidentiary hearing on april   the filing of a single initial determination by judge luckern by july   and a target date for the consolidated investigations of november   by which date the usitc should issue its final determination 
on december   nokia moved for an order terminating  or alternatively  staying the usitc investigation as to nokia  on the ground that nokia and interdigital must first arbitrate a dispute as to whether nokia is licensed under the patents asserted by interdigital against nokia in the usitc investigation 
on 
table of contents january   judge luckern issued an order denying nokia s motion and holding that nokia has waived its arbitration defense by instituting and participating in the investigation and other legal proceedings 
on february   nokia filed an action in the us district court for the southern district of new york  seeking to preliminarily enjoin interdigital from proceeding with the usitc action with respect to nokia  in spite of judge luckern s ruling denying nokia s motion to terminate the investigation 
nokia raises in this preliminary injunction action the same arguments it raised in its motion to terminate the itc investigation  namely that interdigital allegedly must first arbitrate its dispute with nokia and that nokia has not waived this defense 
the court has scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for march  on february   nokia filed a motion for summary determination that interdigital cannot show that a domestic industry exists in the united states as required to obtain relief 
samsung joined this motion 
interdigital has opposed this motion 
on february and   interdigital filed its own motions for summary determination regarding the domestic industry requirement

nokia ukii action in july  nokia filed a claim in the english high court of justice  chancery division  patents court english high court against itc seeking a declaration that thirty one of itc s umts european patents registered in the uk are not essential ipr for the gpp standard ukii 
on december   the english high court issued a judgment finding that european patent uk  the patent  owned by interdigital technology corporation  is essential to the g umts wcdma european standard promulgated by the european telecommunications standards institute etsi and that this patented invention is infringed by carrying out the method described in the standard 
the patent relates to open loop power control  a fundamental aspect of g technology 
foreign counterparts having identical or similar claim language to the patent have been issued in many parts of the world  including the united states  canada  germany  france  spain  italy  and sweden 
the judicial determination of essentiality is in addition to nokia s withdrawal of its challenge to the essentiality of another patent  european patent uk  relating to pilot codes  effectively conceding that that patent is essential as well 
in the judgment  the english high court ruled that one claim of the patent was essential 
the english high court ruled that a second claim of the patent  as well as three additional patents  were not essential 
a declaration of non essentiality is not a finding that a particular third party product does not infringe an interdigital patent  and no products were in issue in these proceedings 
the judgment is subject to appeal by either party if permission to appeal is granted 
there will be a further hearing in april to determine the form of order to be made as well as any orders relating to attorneys fees 
pursuant to uk law  it is customary for a party winning a motion or the overall outcome of a case to receive reimbursement of attorneys fees from the other party 
depending on the outcome of this hearing  this could result in a substantial amount for the company  nokia or neither party 
at december   we accrued million for the potential reimbursement of legal fees associated with this matter

table of contents samsung rd arbitration in october  samsung electronics filed a request for a new icc arbitration proceeding the samsung rd arbitration relating to the ongoing patent royalty dispute between samsung and interdigital 
in the samsung rd arbitration  samsung electronics seeks to have a new arbitration panel determine new royalty rates for samsung s g g gsm gprs edge product sales based on the april nokia settlement  which implemented a june nokia arbitration award 
samsung has purported to have elected the nokia settlement under the most favored licensee mfl clause in the samsung agreement 
samsung contends that it has the right to have a new rate  based on the nokia settlement  applied to its sales in the period from january  through december  in lieu of the royalty rates that have been determined by the tribunal in the samsung nd arbitration for that period 
in addition to seeking relief based on the nokia settlement  samsung has expressly reserved a purported right to make an mfl election of another specified license agreement between interdigital and a third party  and to add claims relating to that agreement 
in the samsung rd arbitration proceeding  we have denied that samsung is entitled to receive any new royalty rate adjustment based on the nokia settlement or the specified third party license agreement 
we have also counterclaimed  seeking an award of the royalties samsung owes for its g g sales in at the royalty rate specified in the august award in the samsung nd arbitration 
in february  the tribunal heard oral argument on the issue of whether samsung is entitled to elect the nokia settlement 
the tribunal has not indicated when it will render a decision on this issue 
the parties will need to present evidence and or argument in a further phase of this arbitration on the amount of royalties samsung owes for its g g sales in  and  depending on the tribunal s decision as to whether samsung is entitled to elect the nokia settlement  possibly for earlier periods of time 
other we have filed patent applications in the united states and in numerous foreign countries 
in the ordinary course of business  we currently are  and expect from time to time to be  subject to challenges with respect to the validity of our patents and with respect to our patent applications 
we intend to continue to vigorously defend the validity of our patents and defend against any such challenges 
however  if certain key patents are revoked or patent applications are denied  our patent licensing opportunities could be materially and adversely affected 
we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  may have disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable patent license agreement 
for example  we could have a disagreement with a licensee as to the amount of reported sales of covered products and royalties owed 
our patent license agreements typically provide for arbitration as the mechanism for resolving disputes 
arbitration proceedings can be resolved through an award rendered by an arbitration panel or through private settlement between the parties 
in addition to disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including the litigation and other proceedings described above  we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by us for insurance coverage involving the nokia delaware proceeding 
based upon information presently available to us  we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other disputes and legal actions will not have a material adverse affect on us 
among the types of legal proceedings we encounter in the normal course of business  we are engaged in the following action 
table of contents federal in may  the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding between interdigital communications corporation now interdigital communications  llc and interdigital technology corporation collectively  interdigital  we  or our and federal insurance company federal  and relating to a litigation expense and reimbursement agreement signed in february by the parties reimbursement agreement  refused to award the full amount of federal s claim which was in excess of million 
the arbitrator did award federal approximately million  pursuant to a formula set forth in the reimbursement agreement  for reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses previously paid to or on behalf of interdigital by federal  plus approximately million in interest 
as additional reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses  the arbitrator awarded million  without interest  as federal s share under the reimbursement agreement of additional value of the settlement between interdigital and ericsson inc further  the arbitrator ruled that interdigital must pay federal of any additional payments interdigital may receive as a result of an audit of sony ericsson s sales 
in june  we notified federal that we had received million from sony ericsson to resolve sony ericsson s payment obligations following an audit 
the approximately million portion of the award represents a percentage of the amounts interdigital has received since march from telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson and ericsson inc  and sony ericsson mobile communications ab under their respective patent license agreements 
in june  federal moved to confirm the award in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
also in june  we filed an opposition to federal s motion to confirm the arbitration award and a cross motion to vacate a portion of the award  totaling approximately million  on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority 
we also moved the court to stay confirmation of the award pending adjudication of our recoupment defense whereby we are seeking to recoup the full amount of the award based on federal s bad faith breach of its contractual and fiduciary duties to us 
in july  the court heard oral arguments on federal s motion to confirm the award  our opposition thereto  our cross motion to vacate the award  and to stay confirmation pending adjudication of our recoupment defense 
the court has not yet ruled on these pending motions 
at the time of judgment we recorded an expense of approximately million which represents the total amount of the award through third quarter  less the amount of a previously accrued liability of million 
we have also accrued post judgment interest of million and reported such interest expense within the interest and other income  net line item of our statement of income 
financial position  liquidity and capital requirements in and  we generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to g and g patent licensing agreements

in  we recorded gross increases in deferred revenue of million  million of which relates to a payment received from lg in first quarter  million related to new prepayments from existing licensees and million related to a prepayment and accrued receivable from a new licensee 
the gross increases in deferred revenue were offset  in part  by deferred revenue recognition of million related to the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments  million related to per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees and the recognition of deferred revenue related to technology solutions agreements 
in  based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances 
we used net cash in investing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
we sold million of short term marketable securities  net of purchases  in we purchased million of short term marketable securities  net of sales  in this change resulted from the investment of significant cash receipts from operating activities in offset in part by our activity under our share repurchase program 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in due to continued investment in both development tools and engineering related network infrastructure and systems 
we also paid million and million in and  respectively  toward technology licenses necessary for our slimchip product family 
investment costs associated with patents increased from million in to million in this increase reflects higher patent application activity over the past several years  combined with the lag effect between filing an initial patent application and the incurrence of costs to issue the patent in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
net cash used in financing activities in increased million to million from million
