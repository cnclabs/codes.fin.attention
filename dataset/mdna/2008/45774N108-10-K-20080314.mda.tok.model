overview innophos holdings  inc is the parent holding company for a number of other holding and operating companies shown below 
in august  for a total purchase of million  we completed the acquisition  referred to as the acquisition  of the assets and equity interests comprising the north america specialty phosphates business  referred to as the phosphates business  then being conducted by rhodia sa and its affiliates 
below is a summary chart of the corporate structure of our subsidiaries 
logo in november we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  or ipo  selling a total of  shares together with  shares sold by selling stockholders at per share for total net proceeds to innophos of million after underwriters discounts  commissions and expenses 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders 
we used the net offering proceeds to pay down approximately million in principal of floating rate senior notes due of a subsidiary  or the floating rate senior notes  in december  paying a call premium and accrued interest of approximately million and resulting in an approximate million charge to earnings for the acceleration of deferred financing charges 

table of contents overview our financial performance in was highlighted by a sales increase of from to million  with increases occurring across all segments of the business 
gross profit for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to  as selling prices and volume mix effects outpaced increases in raw material and other manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the same period in when the company incurred million in expenses related to the company s termination of a management advisory agreement with bain capital during the fourth quarter of the company lowered its net interest expense in primarily by completing a refinancing transaction where the floating rate senior notes  its highest cost debt  were replaced by our lower cost senior unsecured notes due  or senior unsecured notes 
net loss improved by million  or  compared to in addition  we paid dividends of 
per share of common stock 
refer to the company s results of operations and liquidity for the year ended december  for further details 
during  the company continued to implement its strategy  which is designed to grow with our markets  improve our cost structure  and reduce financial leverage and interest expense 
some of the actions taken during include expanding the markets we serve through geographic expansion of our proprietary products and new products 
we grew our export business in by approximately 
in sourcing the global sales and marketing functions of our pharma business by terminating an exclusive sales agency agreement with rhodia  thereby allowing us to draw closer to our pharmaceutical customers and grow that business 
focusing on high growth niches with targeted products and new market development to strengthen our position in the market 
implementing cost savings projects addressing energy consumption  yields and efficiencies in coatzacoalcos and the reorganization of our mexican workforce 
completing a refinancing transaction replacing the remainder of our floating rate senior notes with million of senior unsecured notes at a lower fixed rate 
making pre payments of million on our bank term loan indebtedness 
recent trends and outlook a tightening of supply became apparent in the us specialty phosphate market during the fourth quarter of during that quarter  imports from overseas competitors dropped by roughly from previous levels due to european and asian suppliers significantly reducing exports to the us market 
management believes the reduction can only be partially explained by anticipation of successful anti dumping actions and the resulting shmp duties levied on chinese producers 
globally  there are a number of producers experiencing difficulty with supply for various reasons 
we believe that the principal cause rests with demand for raw materials from the fertilizer industry that has continued to grow to levels that we have not seen in the past 
the factors that we believe are driving this demand  robust grain demand and prices  international demand for higher food crop yields and for biofuels  and continuing strong demand for metals  all remain in place  and they are creating a pricing environment that is truly dynamic 
market prices of phosphate rock and sulfur  two primary raw materials used in the production of specialty phosphates  have increased substantially over the last several quarters 
if current raw material market price levels for phosphate rock and sulfur are sustained throughout into early  we currently estimate that our annual raw material costs will increase by an amount equivalent to approximately of annual sales by early  as compared to our cost structure at year end historically  we have successfully recovered raw material  energy  and other cost increases through price increases 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented price increases in all our product lines  most of which became effective january  we also implemented additional price increases through february and have recently announced additional price increases for april 
our january and february price increases  together  are expected to fully recover the above estimated increases in raw material costs 
while there may be timing differences between raw material cost increases and our product price increases  management expects price increases will be achieved ahead of realized cost increases potentially 
table of contents by a material amount for the near term 
while we cannot guarantee that these measures will succeed  marketplace acceptance rates for these increases have to date been high 
in light of recent market volatility  it is possible that near term actual raw materials cost increases may exceed current estimates  and that additional price increases or employment of other measures may be necessary to recover additional cost increases 
finally  as we raise prices  it is possible that demand for our products may decline to the extent our customers reformulate their products or otherwise reduce purchases from us

segment reporting we report our operations in three business segments united states  mexico and canada  each of which sells the entire portfolio of products 
the primary performance indicators for the chief operating decision maker are sales and operating income  with sales on a ship from basis 
the following table sets forth the historical results of these indicators by segment segment net sales united states mexico canada total net sales growth united states mexico canada total segment operating income united states mexico canada total segment operating income of net sales united states mexico canada segment net sales in the united states net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared with selling prices increased sales with an increase in specialty salts and specialty acids being partially offset by a decrease in the other product lines 
volume and mix impact upon revenue was an increase of  with favorable variances in purified phosphoric acid and specialty salts and specialty acids 
shows a decrease in net sales of when compared with positive price increases across all product lines of did not compensate for the volume and mix impact upon revenue decrease of  primarily in specialty salts and specialty acids and stpp other products

volume and mix impact upon revenue was a decrease of  with a decrease in purified phosphoric acid being partially offset by an increase in specialty salts and specialty acids 
net sales increased when compared with selling prices increased primarily in purified phosphoric acid and stpp other products 
revenue increased due to the volume and mix impact upon revenue increases in stpp other products exceeding lower volume and mix impacts upon revenue in all other products 
in canada net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared with selling prices decreased sales  while volume and mix impact upon revenue was an increase of  primarily in specialty salts and specialty acids 
net sales in canada decreased when compared with volume and mix impacts upon revenue decreased  primarily in specialty salts and specialty acids  which exceeded increased prices of across all products 

table of contents segment operating income of net sales the increase in the united states for the year ended december  compared with was mainly due to decreased unusual costs between the two periods 
included in operating income were million of unusual items primarily related to for the early cancellation of the rhodia pharma sales agency arrangement and the transfer of business related assets and intellectual property to innophos 
included in operating income were million of unusual items related to the ipo 
favorable volume and mix effects upon revenue and slightly higher selling prices were more than offset by higher raw material and transportation costs  as well as higher manufacturing and operating expenses 
the decrease in the united states from to is mainly due to expenses related to the company s evaluation of strategic initiatives which ultimately resulted in the ipo and termination of the bain advisory agreement  all of which was paid by the united states 
increases in raw material prices  and freight costs  unfavorable mix  decreased sales volume and mix impacts upon revenue exceeding increased prices  and higher fixed costs due to planned inventory reductions added to the decline 
the increase in mexico for the year ended december  compared with was due to favorable selling prices which exceeded higher raw material and maintenance outage costs 
there were minimal volume and mix effects upon revenue 
there were also increased costs associated with the mexican workforce reorganization and expenses related to settlement of prior period mexican port facilities taxes 
the increase in mexico from to is due to favorable selling price and lower raw material costs exceeding higher fixed costs due to planned inventory reductions following our major non annual maintenance outage and related expenses 
the increase in canada for the year ended december  compared with was due to positive volume and mix impacts upon revenue  and lower manufacturing costs including depreciation and amortization expense 
selling prices were essentially flat 
the increase in canada from to is due to selling price improvements  which exceeded the margin losses from lower sales volume and mix impacts upon revenue 
the united states had depreciation and amortization of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
canada had depreciation and amortization of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
mexico had depreciation and amortization of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth a summary of the company s cash flows for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions year ended december  operating activities investing activities financing activities year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in operating activities cash resulted from a favorable change of million in net income  partially offset by unfavorable changes of million in non cash items affecting net income  million change in net working capital  and million change in non current accounts 
non cash items affecting net income were unfavorable by million in primarily due to our election to pay cash interest on the floating rate senior notes instead of making interest payments in kind  the april refinancing of those notes to solely cash paying notes  and lower deferred financing expense  partially offset by increased depreciation expense and decreased benefit from deferred taxes 
changes in non current accounts had an unfavorable impact on cash of million 
this was mainly due to increased long term liabilities in which were mostly pension related  partially offset by a favorable movement in other comprehensive income  and a reclassification of deferred taxes from long term to other current assets in the change in net working capital was a use of cash of million in compared to a source in of million  an increase in the use of cash of million 
increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and other current assets exceeded increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities in  leading to the million use of cash 
this is due in part to higher selling prices  increasing accounts receivable balances and high raw material costs increasing both inventory and accounts payable 
we expect working capital to continue to increase in as we raise prices and incur higher raw material costs 

table of contents total inventories increased million from december levels as the result of higher raw material costs 
days of inventory on hand increased days as a result 
the following chart shows its historical performance inventory days on hand the company and the union in mexico reached an agreement  which was ratified by the union on march  as a result  the company paid approximately million for the severance and benefits for the elimination of personnel and approximately million for benefit reductions for continuing employees  all in the second quarter of net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase in the use of cash of million 
this was mainly due to increased capital spending related to the cogeneration project in coatzacoalcos  mexico  and the purchase of assets from rhodia related to the early cancellation of the pharma sales agency agreement 
as of december   we expended for the cogeneration project which remained on budget and on schedule 
net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december   was a use of million  compared to a use of million in  a decrease of million 
this was primarily due to million less term loan principal payments made in versus  and million of regular quarterly dividends paid on the common stock during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in operating activities is primarily due to million lower net income as described earlier  offset by favorable changes of million in non cash items affecting net income  million in net working capital  and million in non current accounts 
non cash items affecting net income were favorable by million primarily due to the higher interest on our floating rate senior notes  and increased deferred financing resulting from our debt retirement 
these affects were partially offset by reduced deferred taxes 
the change in net working capital is a source of cash of million in compared to a source in of million  an increase of million 
the net source of million in is due to the following million higher accounts receivable  million lower net other current assets and other current liabilities primarily from lower interest payable due to the reduced level of debt and lower income taxes payable due to the offset of prepaid income tax in mexico  million higher accounts payable as the result of normal business operating activities and  million lower inventory described below total inventories decreased million from december levels as the result of planned reductions after completion of the major non annual maintenance outages at coatzacoalcos and geismar in the first half of days of inventory on hand decreased days as a result of this action 
the following chart shows its historical performance aggregated inventory days on hand changes in non current accounts had a favorable impact on cash of million 
this was due to increased long term liabilities  mostly pension related  a favorable change in deferred profit sharing in mexico in there was a million reduction in long term deferred profit sharing due to tax law changes 

table of contents we entered into management retention bonus agreements with certain executives which provided  upon the successful completion of our ipo  for a total bonus of million 
we expensed million of this amount in the fourth of quarter  the remainder to be expensed over  and the first quarter of net cash used for investing activities was million for  compared to million for  a reduction in cash of million 
this is due to increased capital spending  some of which is related to the cogeneration project in coatzacoalcos  the completion of the information technology separation from rhodia  and packaging and yield improvement projects at nashville and waterway facilities in the united states 
it was expected that capital spending will continue to run below depreciation levels  although will see a substantial increase compared to the last two years due to the cogeneration project 
net cash from financing activities for was a use million  compared to source of cash of million in  a decrease of million 
in there were net proceeds of million as a result of the ipo  after deducting for underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses 
the funds were used to call million principal of floating rate senior notes and pay related call premiums and penalties 
the company made principal payments on its term loan of million of which million was the excess cash flow payment required five days after issuance of the annual audited financial statements  as defined in our credit agreement  voluntary prepayments of million and required principal payments of million 
the financing activities during the year ended december  were attributable to the company electing to borrow the remaining million of our term loan under our senior credit facility to retire the million outstanding on our revolving credit facility  along with term loan principal payments of million 
in february we completed a private offering of million floating rate senior notes  the proceeds of which  less fees and expenses  were distributed to stockholders 
other liquidity in november  we successfully completed the ipo  selling million primary shares at per share 
net proceeds plus cash on hand were used for the following called in december million principal of floating rate senior notes due and paid related premiums of million and interest of million 
made million of voluntary repayments on our term loan in october and november of as a result  the company was not required to make an excess cash flow payment for full year paid bain capital million in november to terminate our advisory agreement as permitted under the agreement upon the consummation of an ipo 
paid ipo related expenses in november and december of  including management retention bonuses of million 
in and total debt was reduced million or and million or to million as of december  net debt short term and long term debt net of cash was million as of december  total debt comprised borrowings of million of term loan under our bank senior credit facility  million senior subordinated notes due  and million senior unsecured notes due in addition  as part of our bank senior credit facility  we also have a million revolving credit line  of which up to million may be used for letters of credit 
funds are available for continuous borrowing under our senior credit facility revolving credit line  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the absence of default 
we expect that our primary liquidity requirements will be for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
as of december   million remained available under the revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  as there were no amounts outstanding except for million issued under our letter of credit sub facility 
however  the company borrowed million on the revolving credit facility on january  for working capital purposes 
the commitments under the revolving credit line will expire on august  we will be able to repay revolving credit loans and reborrow amounts that are repaid up to the amount of the revolving credit commitment then in effect  subject to the debt agreement provisions 
the outstanding amount of the term loan at year end is repayable by its terms in quarterly installments of approximately million through september  and four quarterly installments of approximately million thereafter with final payment due august  in february  innophos mexicana  one of our subsidiaries  secured a million letter of credit facility for suppliers under contractual arrangements 
the interest rate on the borrowings under the senior credit facility is predicated upon the absence of any material adverse change in our financial condition as well as the absence of any financial covenants defaults as defined 
as of december   no material adverse change had occurred and we believe that we were in compliance with the facility s covenant requirements 

table of contents as indicated elsewhere  the current recommendation of management and the policy of our board of directors is to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of per share 
that policy may change and is subject to numerous conditions and variables 
see the section entitled dividends in item of this form k 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
subject to restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the notes  we may incur more debt for working capital  capital expenditures  and for other purposes 
capital expenditures we spent million in on projects that were capitalized 
additionally  we spent million in on maintenance projects that were expensed during the year 
of this million  million was related to planned major non annual maintenance expenses 
these amounts compare to million of capitalized projects and million of maintenance projects that were expensed during the year of which million was related to planned major non annual maintenance 
we expect our capital expenditures to continue to run below depreciation levels 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our long term contractual cash obligations as of december  dollars in thousands years ending december  contractual obligations total thereafter senior credit facility senior subordinated notes due future service pension benefits other operating leases senior unsecured notes due april total contractual cash obligations amounts do not include variable rate interest payments  any voluntary principal prepayments  and excess cash flow requirements as defined by the credit agreement 
estimated annual interest payments would be approximately million assuming a interest rate 
the company made payments of million on march   million on june   million on september  and million on december  amounts exclude the million revolving portion of the senior credit facility which has issued approximately million of letters of credit under the sub facility which reduces the available credit to million as of december  amounts include fixed rate interest payments at for years and thereafter

critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for bad debts  the recoverability of long term assets such as goodwill and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization periods  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for 
table of contents making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
claims and legal proceedings the categories of asserted or unasserted claims for which the company has estimated a probable liability and for which amounts are estimable are critical accounting estimates 
please refer to the section entitled commitments and contingencies contained in note for additional information about such estimates 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are accounted for by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are assessed for recoverability and a valuation allowance is considered necessary if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will continue to analyze our current and future profitability and probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods 
if we determine that we will be able to utilize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be reversed to income in the period such determination is made 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets of the businesses acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires periodic tests of the impairment of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires a comparison  at least annually  of the net book value of the assets and liabilities associated with a reporting unit  including goodwill  with the fair value of the reporting unit  which corresponds to the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit  in the absence of an active market 
when this comparison indicates that impairment must be recorded  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of these assets 
the annual goodwill impairment review for us is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year 
we use a discounted cash flow approach based on forward looking information of revenues and costs as well as appropriate discount rates for each reporting unit 
long lived assets including property  plant and equipment and amortized intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
when this comparison indicates that impairment must be recorded  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of these assets 
impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the determination whether or not these assets are impaired and the corresponding useful lives of these long lived assets requires significant judgment 
stock based compensation expense our compensation programs can include share based payments 
in  and  the primary share based awards and their general terms and conditions are as follows stock options  which entitle the holder to purchase  after the end of a vesting term  a specified number of shares of innophos common stock at an exercise price per share set equal to the market price of innophos common stock on the date of grant

the company accounts for the options granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r under the plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the valuation method that the company used under sfas no 
dictated the transition method that the company used under sfas no 
r 
as permitted under sfas no 
 the company valued its stock options at the grant date using the minimum value method 
because the company used the minimum value method under sfas no 
 we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method and therefore  prior periods were not restated and we have not recognized in the financial statements the remaining compensation cost calculated under the minimum value method 
the determination of the fair value of the underlying common stock used to determine the exercise prices for the stock options granted on april  was performed contemporaneously with the issuance of these common stock option grants 
under the prospective transition method  only new awards or awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the company will continue to account for the plan outstanding awards under apb until they are settled or modified 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r and through december  the company did not modify any existing stock option awards that were granted under sfas no 
in the third quarter of the company made a modification to the plan stock option awards granted under apb  however the modification did not result in any incremental fair value adjustment and  thus  no compensation expense 
the fair value of the options granted during was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model were as follows non qualified stock options year ended december  expected volatility dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term years weighted average grant date fair value of stock options performance shares year ended december  expected volatility dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term years weighted average grant date fair value of performance shares since innophos holdings  inc is a newly public entity and has limited historical data on the price of its publicly traded shares  the expected volatility for the valuation of its stock options and performance shares was based on peer group historical volatility data equaling the expected term 
the expected term for the stock options is based on the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
since the company has limited data on the exercises of stock options and these stock options qualify as plain vanilla stock options as outlined in sab no 
the expected term for the performance shares is a year cliff vesting 
the dividend yield is the expected annual dividend payments divided by the average stock price up to 
table of contents the date of grant 
the risk free interest rates are derived from the us treasury securities in effect on the date of grant whose maturity period equals the options expected term 
the company applies an expected forfeiture rate to stock based compensation expense 
the estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
as actual forfeitures become known  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
declared dividends will accrue on the performance shares and will vest over the same period 
on november   the company s board of directors awarded  shares of restricted stock with a fair value of million to directors and certain executive officers 
these awards are classified as equity awards and vest over nine quarters in equal installments of per quarter beginning january  declared dividends will accrue on the restricted stock and will vest over the same period 
upon vesting  the restricted stock will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock 
the related compensation expense is based on the date of grant share price of the compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the company recognized approximately million and million of compensation expense in and  respectively 
there were  unvested shares granted as of december  as of december   there are  unvested shares and  shares which have vested 
pension and post retirement costs the company maintains both noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that together cover all us and canadian employees 
in the united states  salaried and most hourly employees are covered by a defined contribution plan with a k feature 
the plan provides for employee contributions  company matching contributions  and an age weighted annual company contribution to eligible employees 
union represented hourly employees  at our nashville site  are covered by a traditional defined benefit plan providing benefits based on years of service and final average pay 
on april   the company and the union for the hourly employees at our nashville facility agreed that it would freeze its defined benefit pension plan the plan as of august  the accrual of additional benefits or increase in the current level of benefits under the plan ceased as of august   after which the nashville union employees now participate in the company s existing non contributory defined contribution benefit plan 
all plans were established by innophos in in canada  salaried employees are covered by defined contribution plans which provide for company contributions as a percent of pay  employee contributions  and company matching contributions 
union represented hourly employees are covered by a defined benefit plan providing benefits based on a negotiated benefit level and years of service 
our pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate on plan assets 
these assumptions require significant judgment and material changes in our pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in levels of benefits provided  and changes in asset levels 
such assumptions are based on benchmarks obtained from third party sources 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption would increase our net periodic benefit cost for our pension and post retirement plans by approximately a decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets would increase our pension plan expense by recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates  as borrowings under our senior credit facility will bear interest at floating rates based on libor or the base rate  in each case plus an applicable borrowing margin 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed rate and floating rate debt to the extent practicable consistent with our credit status 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do not affect earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally affect our earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt and a maximum of million of available floating rate debt  including million under our revolving credit facility 
based on million outstanding borrowings as floating rate debt under our senior credit facility  an immediate increase of one percentage point would cause an increase to cash interest expense of approximately million per year 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and other operating expenses and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
in addition  a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service debt  which may affect our ability to make future acquisitions or capital expenditures 
we may from time to time use interest rate protection agreements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuation 
regardless of hedges  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge our commodity or currency rate risks 
in april  we entered into two interest rate cap derivative instruments each with a notional amount of million with rate caps of  one with a referenced index that is based on a three month libor and that expires in april and one with a referenced index that is based on a one month libor and that expires in april we believe that our concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable is limited since these receivables are spread among a number of customers and are geographically dispersed 
no one customer accounted for more than of our sales in the last years 
we did purchase a forward natural gas contract which requires us to purchase approximately of our monthly natural gas usage requirements at a fixed price 
this contract is for and applies to our coatzacoalcos facility 
foreign currency exchange rates the us dollar is the functional currency of the canadian and mexican operations 
accordingly  these operations monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates  non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates  and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and at historical exchange rates for the related revenue and expenses of non monetary assets and liabilities 
all transaction gains and losses are included in net income 
our principal source of exchange rate exposure in our foreign operations consists of expenses  such as labor expenses  which are denominated in the foreign currency of the country in which we operate 
a decline in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency would generally cause our operational expenses particularly labor costs to increase conversely  a decline in the value of the foreign currency relative to the us dollar would cause these expenses to decrease 
we believe that normal exchange rate fluctuations consistent with recent historical trends would have a modest impact on our expenses  and would not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
nearly all of our sales are denominated in us dollars and our exchange rate exposure in terms of sales revenues is minimal 
inflation and changing prices our costs and expenses will be subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
significant price fluctuations in raw materials  freight  and energy costs  if not compensated for by cost savings from production efficiencies or price increases passed on to customers could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
refer to risk factors for further discussions on raw materials availability and pricing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
