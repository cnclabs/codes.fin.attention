item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through three basic segments or operations building  civil and management services 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  sports and entertainment  education  transportation  corrections  healthcare  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the u 
s 
military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
we have been chosen by the federal government for significant projects related to defense and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement and steel erection 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
for the year ended december   we achieved for the second consecutive year record revenues of billion and record income from construction operations of million 
we also achieved a record net income of million  led by our building and management services segments 
we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to contracts in place  during and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion 
our financial condition continued to strengthen during at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to 
our solid base of stockholders equity increased to million as of december   reflecting the outstanding operating results achieved in in addition  we have million available to borrow under our credit facility at december  recent developments management changes in september  we announced the appointment of kenneth r

backlog analysis for we received billion of new contract awards and additions to contracts in place during resulting in a year end backlog of billion at december  the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenue backlog at december  awarded recognized december  in thousands building civil management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our balance sheet as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings relating to unapproved change orders and claims included in our balance sheet at december  and is summarized below december  in thousands unapproved change orders claims of the balance of unapproved change orders and claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings at december  and december   approximately million and million respectively  are amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings as described in item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
these amounts are management s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to reduce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against earnings in the relevant future period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period such amounts are resolved 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation and general liability coverage 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation and general liability coverage is generally  per occurrence and our maximum self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program is  per occurrence 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transitions 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  there was no impact on our total liabilities or stockholders equity 
as of december   we identified and reviewed potential uncertainties related to taxes upon the adoption of fin and determined that the exposure to those uncertainties did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity and fixed income 
we plan to continue to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity and bond market performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and accordingly  we adjusted our pension liability by decreases of million in and million in  and an increase of million in  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an increase reduction in stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the current vested benefits will be preserved 
due to the expected change in the discount rate assumption for noted above and to decreased amortization of prior years investment losses in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we anticipate that pension expense will decrease from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment 
results of operations compared to revenues increased by  million to a record  million  gross profit increased by million  income from construction operations increased by million  and net income increased by million or to a record million in our strong performance in was led by our building and management services segments 
the increase in revenues and profit primarily reflects the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues and profit as expected 
in addition  our management services segment also made a significant contribution to our operating results 
basic earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  diluted earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues increased by  million or  from  million in to  million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of  million or  from  million in to  million in  primarily as a result of the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues as expected  led by an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of and in  which are now well into the construction phase 
civil construction revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the timing of the start up of new work 
management services revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the completion of our nuclear power plant maintenance and modification contract with exelon as of december  and to a lower volume of work in iraq 
income loss from construction operations for the increase year ended december  decrease in income change in millions building civil management services subtotal less corporate total building construction income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the significant increase in revenues discussed above 
partly offsetting the increase in gross profit resulting from the increase in revenues was an million increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses related to the significant increase in the volume of work put in place  as well as to a million increased provision for incentive compensation due to the significantly improved building construction operating results  and a million increased charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in the second quarter of civil construction income from operations decreased by million  from a profit of million in to a loss of million in civil construction income from operations in reflected downward profit adjustments recorded on several projects in the mid atlantic and southeast regions  including a roadway project in maryland  while the loss in was due primarily to recording a charge with respect to the matter discussed in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
had that charge in not been recorded  the civil construction segment would still have experienced a loss from operations of approximately million due primarily to i downward profit adjustments recorded on a bridge rehabilitation project and on two mass transit projects in metropolitan new york  and ii an increase in civil construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a decrease in the number of active projects  as well as an increase in legal fees relating to open legal matters 
despite the decrease in revenues discussed above  management services income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to favorable performance on work in iraq which more than offset the decreased profit contribution resulting from the completion of our contract with exelon as of december  overall income from construction operations was favorably impacted by a million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million decrease in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in  and partly offsetting this decrease were increases in certain outside consulting fees and a million increase in the provision for corporate incentive compensation due to the significantly improved operating results 
other income increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in interest income as a result of the positive cash flow we generated from operating activities in the latter half of and throughout also  we realized a gain of million in resulting from the sale of a parcel of land used in operations 
in addition  the net gain on sales of parcels of developed land held for sale increased by million in due to higher sales activity 
based on our limited remaining inventory of developed land held for sale and the anticipated selling prices for those parcels  we believe that the net gain recorded in is not indicative of future results 
interest expense decreased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the february  repayment of our term loan in full in conjunction with the closing of our new credit agreement 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in pretax income in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is due primarily to a decrease in disallowed tax deductions 
results of operations compared to revenues increased by billion  gross profit increased by million  income from construction operations increased by million  and net income increased by million or in these increases primarily reflect the addition of rudolph and sletten which we acquired in october  an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of  and an increased profit contribution from our management services segment 
moreover  the operating results were severely impacted by an after tax charge of million relating to the judgment against two company joint ventures in the matter of mergentime corporation  et al 
vs 
washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata 
without the impact of the wmata charge in  net income would have been million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the operating results for the year ended december  were reduced by a million pretax charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from restricted stock units granted in basic earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  diluted earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues increased by billion or  from billion in to billion in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of  million or  from  million in to  million in  due to the addition of rudolph and sletten  and to an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of without the addition of rudolph and sletten  building construction revenues would have increased by million or in civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the higher backlog of civil construction work entering compared to partly offsetting these increases was a decrease in management services revenues of million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to a decreased volume of work in afghanistan 
income loss from construction operations for the increase year ended december  decrease in income change in millions building civil management services subtotal less corporate total building construction income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increased revenues discussed above 
without the addition of rudolph and sletten  building construction income from operations would have increased by million or due primarily to the increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of building construction income from operations was reduced by a million charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in civil construction income from operations increased by million  from a loss of million in to income of million in  due primarily to the adverse impact of the wmata charge in without the wmata charge  civil construction income from operations would have decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to downward profit adjustments on several projects in the mid atlantic and southeast regions  including a roadway project in maryland 
civil construction income from operations was reduced in by a million charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in despite the decrease in revenues discussed above  management services income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to favorable performance on work in iraq 
in addition  management services income from operations benefited from a million decrease in management services related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of certain restricted stock awards granted in and overall income from construction operations was reduced by a million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of certain restricted stock units granted in and  as well as the recognition of million of expenses related to our decision to not proceed with our debt offering in the second quarter of other income increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in interest income as a result of an increase in cash available for short term investment due largely to the cash and investments obtained in the acquisition of rudolph and sletten and to the positive cash flow we generated from operating activities in the latter half of partly offsetting this increase was a million decrease in net gain recorded from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale 
interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to increased borrowings related to the million term loan received as part of the credit agreement in october  which we used to refinance a portion of the purchase price for the rudolph and sletten acquisition 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in pretax income in the effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate for was 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash and cash equivalents as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with their percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and  cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was million and million  respectively  and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively 
the company s cash balance at december  includes million which represents an advance received from a project owner to be used to fund subcontract work on a specific project under certain circumstances 
the company has included this amount in its contract billings and it is included as a component of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in the consolidated balance sheets at december  from time to time  we have invested a portion of our available cash in auction rate securities of varying maturities 
as of february   our investment portfolio included a total of million face value of these securities 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate some of our investments in auction rate securities that we classify as short term investments on our balance sheet 
we typically hold a variety of highly rated aaa or aa interest bearing auction rate securities that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
we believe that these unsuccessful auctions are a short term market issue  and that based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our anticipated operating cash flows  and our available revolving credit facility  we do not expect that the short term lack of liquidity of some of our auction rate security investments will materially affect our overall liquidity position 
billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors on a particular project after we receive payment from our customer 
a summary of cash flows for each of the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  in millions cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities compared to is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities was partly used to fund million in financing activities  primarily to pay in full the remaining million balance outstanding on our term loan in conjunction with the closing of our new revolving credit facility in february  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill  and to partly fund million in investing activities  principally for the purchase of construction equipment and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to purchase a net million of auction rate securities for short term investment purposes 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities compared to was primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues  including the acquisition of rudolph and sletten  as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities increased substantially even though included payment of the million wmata judgment recorded in cash flow from operating activities was partly used to fund million in investing activities  principally to fund the purchase of construction equipment to support our substantial backlog and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to fund million in financing activities  primarily to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities and million in cash flow from financing activities to fund million in investing activities and to increase our cash balance by million 
cash flow from financing activities primarily reflected million in proceeds received from a new secured term loan established in conjunction with a new credit agreement that we entered into on october  cash flow from financing activities also included a million reduction in debt  primarily to pay down a portion of the debt we assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill  and a million expenditure for the purchase of our preferred stock pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the lawsuit brought by certain holders of our preferred stock 
cash flow used by investing activities primarily reflected the funding of the acquisitions of cherry hill in january and rudolph and sletten in october for million and million  respectively  net of the cash balances acquired  as well as the purchase of construction equipment used in our operations 
proceeds from investing activities included million from the sale of certain marketable securities acquired in the purchases of cherry hill and rudolph and sletten  and million from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale 
working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  working capital requirements in included the funding of our acquisitions of cherry hill and rudolph and sletten 
the current ratio increased from x to x during the same period 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and three participant lenders the amended agreement 
the amended agreement amends and restates in its entirety the company s previously existing credit agreement dated as of october   as amended through april  the prior agreement 
the amended agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility of up to million  which can be expanded to million in the future with the consent of the lenders 
this represents an increased borrowing capacity from the prior agreement  which provided for a revolving credit facility of million  plus a term loan in the original amount of million  of which million was outstanding at december  the term loan was paid in full on february  in conjunction with the closing of the amended agreement 
we have not borrowed under our revolving credit facilities during and  but we have utilized them for letters of credit 
accordingly  at december   we have million available to borrow under the revolving facility 
we can choose from interest rate alternatives including a prime based rate  as well as eurodollar rate based options 
while the amended agreement also provides for an increase in the aggregate amount of letters of credit that may be issued under the agreement from million to million  any outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under the revolving facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
the termination date of the revolving facility was extended from june  to february  the amended agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter  including a consolidated net worth of at least million  increased on a cumulative basis commencing with the fiscal quarter ending december   by an amount equal to of consolidated net income with no deductions for net losses for the fiscal quarter then ended plus of the amount of all equity issuances as defined in the amended agreement after february  that increase our consolidated shareholders equity  a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to  a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda over covered charges which includes interest expense  cash taxes and scheduled payments of principal and interest of at least to  and a consolidated asset coverage ratio of at least to the amended agreement also includes operational covenants customary for facilities of this type  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens  as well as restrictions on types of investments and the purchase and sale of assets outside of the normal course of business 
our obligations under the amended agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our current and future subsidiaries  and secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
long term debt long term debt at december  was million  a decrease of million from december   due primarily to payment in full of the remaining million balance outstanding on our term loan in conjunction with the closing of our new revolving credit facility in february in addition  the decrease reflects a reduction in the long term debt we assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill 
accordingly  the long term debt to equity ratio was 
x at december   compared to 
x at december  contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years total debt  excluding interest a interest payments on debt operating leases  net purchase obligations unfunded pension liability b b tutor saliba management agreement total contractual obligations a includes capital leases in the amount of b assumes annual pension fund contributions equal to the contribution amount anticipated in stockholders equity our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the major factors impacting stockholders equity during the three year period were the net income recorded in all three years  the funding of the redemption of the preferred stock in may  the funding of the settlement of the preferred stock lawsuit in november  including the reversal of dividends million previously accrued related to the preferred stock purchased  preferred stock dividends accrued  the annual amortization of restricted stock compensation expense  common stock options and stock purchase warrants exercised  and the income tax benefit attributable to stock based compensation 
also  we were required to adjust our pension liability by decreases of million and million in and  respectively  and increases of million in and million in prior years  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which resulted in an aggregate million accumulated other comprehensive loss reduction in stockholders equity at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to the amount of this additional minimum pension liability will be recorded in future years based upon periodic re evaluation of the funded status of our pension plans 
dividends common stock there were no cash dividends declared or paid on our outstanding common stock during the three years ended december  preferred stock in november  an agreement was reached to settle a class action lawsuit filed by the holders of our preferred stock 
under the terms of the settlement  effective november   we purchased all of the  participating depositary shares that were submitted 
as a result of this transaction  approximately million of previously accrued and unpaid dividends was reversed and approximately million of that amount of previously accrued and unpaid dividends was restored to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets 
on may   we redeemed all remaining outstanding depositary shares in accordance with the terms of our preferred stock at a price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to that date  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
related party transactions we are party to an agreement with tutor saliba corporation  or tutor saliba  a construction company based in california  and ronald n 
tutor  chief executive officer and primary beneficial owner of tutor saliba  to provide certain management services 
mr 
tutor has been our chairman and chief executive officer since march tutor saliba participated in joint ventures with us before the agreement and continues to participate in joint ventures with us after the agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and our short term investment portfolio 
our revolving credit agreement is available for us to borrow  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
during  we did not borrow under our revolving credit facility and the million balance outstanding on our million term loan was repaid in february  in conjunction with the establishment of our new credit facility 
in addition  we had approximately million of short term investments classified as cash equivalents as of december  our short term investment portfolio consists primarily of highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less  all classified as cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we also had million invested in auction rate securities as of december  this investment is classified as available for sale and is included in short term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
from time to time  we have invested a portion of our available cash in highly rated aaa or aa auction rate securities of varying maturities 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  we are not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our anticipated operating cash flows  and our available revolving credit facility  we do not expect that the short term lack of liquidity of some of our auction rate security investments will materially affect our overall liquidity position
