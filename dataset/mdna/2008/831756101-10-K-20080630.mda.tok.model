item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
highlights our fiscal net product and services sales of approximately million represented an increase of over fiscal levels 
sales in our firearms core business increased by to approximately million 
net income for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal net income 
net income was affected by numerous factors  including the following the domestic consumer firearms market experienced a decline in demand commencing during our second fiscal quarter 
the timing of this decline was coincident with an escalation of the sub prime loan crisis  a tightening in the credit markets  the continued worsening of the housing market  increasing fuel prices  less than robust employment growth  and generally weak economic conditions 
these factors contributed to a general slowdown of consumer spending across a wide variety of industry and product lines 
against this environment  unseasonably warm weather throughout most of the united states adversely affected the retail traffic in the sporting goods channel 
at the same time  significant distribution channel purchases in anticipation of a strong hunting season resulted in unexpectedly high inventory levels  which limited the ability of the distribution channel to purchase additional products 
because of the sudden downturn in the firearms market  our inventory levels grew significantly 
in order to bring them more in line with demand  we implemented a three week shutdown of our springfield facility in the third quarter and a one week shutdown of our rochester facility in the fourth quarter 
the resulting unabsorbed overhead caused a decrease in gross profit and net income of million 
in order to stimulate movement in dealer and distributor inventory in the third and fourth quarters  we implemented several consumer driven promotional programs  which cumulatively cost million 
the impact of owning thompson center arms for a full year in fiscal resulted in a million increase in net product sales and a million increase in gross profit 
our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms 
we manufacture a wide array of pistols  revolvers  tactical rifles  hunting rifles  black powder firearms  handcuffs  and firearm related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers  including gun enthusiasts  collectors  hunters  sportsmen  competitive shooters  protection focused individuals  law enforcement agencies and officers  and military agencies in the united states and throughout the world 
we are the largest manufacturer of handguns and handcuffs in the united states  the largest us exporter of handguns  and a growing participant in the tactical and hunting rifle markets that we recently entered 
we manufacture these products at our facilities in springfield  massachusetts  houlton  maine  and rochester  new hampshire 
we also market shotguns  which are manufactured to our specifications in dedicated facilities through a strategic alliance 
in addition  we pursue opportunities to license our name and trademarks to third parties for use in association with their products and services 
we plan to substantially increase our product offerings and our licensing program to leverage the plus year old smith wesson brand and capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic american tradition by expanding consumer awareness of products we produce or license in the safety  security  protection  and sport markets 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use ebitdas earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense to 
table of contents evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data the handgun market in the united states has remained relatively constant over the past years 
handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels then returned to pre levels and have remained relatively unchanged 
within the us handgun market  we estimate that approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we also estimate that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share

table of contents as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between the book value and tax bases in assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  we establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
a valuation allowance of approximately  was provided on our deferred federal tax assets for a capital loss carryforward  which we do not anticipate using prior to its expiration 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april    or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
in addition  we maintained a valuation allowance of approximately  against our state deferred tax assets as of april  and related to state net operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  we determined that this reserve was no longer necessary 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to   and  as of april    and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforward at april  expires in fiscal years and internal revenue code section limits utilization of these losses to  per year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in additional ownership changes pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized 
federal net operating losses account for  of the total net deferred tax liability of  and  of the total net deferred tax liability of  as of april  and  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards amounted to  as of april  there were no state net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of fiscal or on october   the american jobs creation act  or ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity  or qpa  which will be phased in from through pursuant to the financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
 application of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activity provided by the ajca of  the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa benefit for us was approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal and resulted in the reduction of tax expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the annual deduction for the remaining federal net operating loss carryforward is so limited by internal revenue code section that the unfavorable impact on the future benefits of the qpa should be negligible 
in return for the qpa  the ajca provides for a two year transition from the existing extraterritorial income exclusion  or eti  tax benefit for foreign sales  which the world trade organization  or wto  ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
the eti benefit will be fully phased out for us after fiscal the eti benefit for us was approximately  for fiscal 
table of contents net income the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and change change net income net income per share basic diluted the decrease in net income and net income per share for fiscal was primarily attributable to a weak consumer market that prompted increased promotion costs and two unscheduled plant shutdowns leading to unabsorbed overhead 
the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal was attributable to a increase in sales as well as improvements in gross profit and operating income margins resulting from controlled spending 
the net income and net income per share for fiscal included a  pre tax benefit from the reduction in environmental reserves 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our firearms and other operations  including acquisitions  and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total excluding the cash activity relating to the thompson center arms acquisition  operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities decreased by  for fiscal from fiscal levels 
the reduction in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to lower net income offset by higher non cash items included in net income such as depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  and stock based compensation expense as well as a  increase in inventory 
the negative cash flow was partially offset by  in increased accruals over fiscal  caused primarily by accrued promotion costs for the fourth quarter promotions 
cash flow from operating activities increased by  for fiscal over fiscal levels 
the improvement in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to improved profitability  partially offset by a larger increase in working capital in fiscal than in fiscal accounts receivable increased  in fiscal  of which  related to increased activity at thompson center arms since the january  acquisition date and the remaining  due to record fourth quarter sales in the springfield and houlton facilities 
sales for the quarter  excluding thompson center arms  were   higher than for the similar period last year 
non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes  had a significant impact on fiscal results 
depreciation and amortization increased by  as a result of increased capital spending and acquisition related intangible assets while net deferred taxes liability decreased by  primarily resulting from the book deduction of acquisition related assets that are not tax deductible and significant changes in reserves that represent timing difference for tax purposes 

table of contents cash used for investing activities in fiscal of  was significantly lower than in fiscal due to the  used to acquire thompson center arms in january capital spending of  was  lower in fiscal than in fiscal fiscal spending was partially offset by  in cash received from the springfield redevelopment authority as part of the final payment on acres of land sold to them in fiscal excluding the  used to acquire thompson center arms  cash used for investing activities in fiscal totaled  a  reduction in cash used from fiscal usage  primarily due to the  received on the sale of land 
capital expenditures for fiscal were  cash generated by financing activities in fiscal of  was  lower than in fiscal due to  in debt incurred related to the acquisition of thompson center arms in january  partially offset by  in payments to acquire treasury stock in that same fiscal year 
the remaining increase in of  was due to  in increased revolving credit line borrowings to cover current cash requirements offset by  in lower debt issue costs 
at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with toronto dominion texas llc with  outstanding as of april  in may  we completed a stock offering of  shares of common stock  which yielded net proceeds of approximately  and allowed us to repay million in debt that had been incurred to finance a portion of the thompson center arms acquisition 
in conjunction with this repayment  we retired the  million acquisition line of credit we had with toronto dominion texas llc 
based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
our significant estimates include accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our revenue 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or 
table of contents material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenue for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments but instead record such revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately  valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  customer relationships  patents  and trademarks and tradenames 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of customer relationships 
with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of sfas with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review  we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit 
based on this assessment  we have not had any impairment charges as a result of our impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal   or based on the review of long lived assets under sfas 
table of contents significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist  and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including technological advances  increased competition  and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
goodwill and acquired intangibles we completed a significant business acquisition in fiscal  which resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our business strategy contemplates that we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  including the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives  and as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  our market value declines dramatically  or we determine we have more than one reporting unit we may be required to complete the second step  which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of products and services sold 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs as a result of this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  is zero

warranty we generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser of our new firearm products 
we provide for estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and the current repair costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual claims and repair costs that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used to calculate the 
table of contents provision  our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize would be adversely impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our domestic customers and some foreign distributors based on their financial condition

when we believe the extension of credit is not advisable  we rely on either a prepayment or a letter of credit 
we place past due balances for collection with an outside agency after days

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts through current past due balances  knowledge of our customers financial situations  and past payment history 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
we measure these deferred taxes by applying tax rates expected to be in place when the deferred items become subject to income tax or deductible for income tax purposes 
workers compensation we are self insured through retentions or deductibles for our workers compensation 
our liability for estimated premiums and incurred losses are actuarially determined and recorded on an undiscounted basis

restatement sec inquiry in august  we amended various reports previously filed with the sec to modify certain accounting matters related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
we restated our form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  as well as our form qsb reports for the quarters ended july  and  october  and  and january  and the form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  was filed in december and included restated financial statements for fiscal the amended form qsb reports for the july and october quarters were filed in january  and the amended form qsb reports for the january quarters were filed in march the sec is conducting an informal inquiry regarding the 
table of contents circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we are cooperating fully with the sec in this inquiry 
the inquiry is still ongoing 
on may   we received notice that it is the intent of the division of enforcement staff of the sec to recommend that the sec authorize administrative cease and desist proceedings against us to prohibit any future violations of the periodic reporting  record keeping  and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws 
the staff is not recommending the imposition of any monetary sanctions or remedies against us 
the purported violations arose from accounting adjustments made by us for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  which resulted in our restatement of our quarterly and fiscal year end financial statements  and our quarterly report for the period ended january  we do not believe that the staff s current recommendation  if ultimately authorized by the sec  will have any material impact on our financial position

this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we periodically enter into euro participating forward options under which we purchase euros to be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april   our outstanding contracts had a remaining balance of million euros 
the contracts are for  euros per month with the last expiring on june  participating forward options provide full protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar to the euro and partial benefit from the appreciation of the us dollar to the euro 
if the euro strengthens above the average rate  we will not pay more than the average rate 
if the euro weakens below the average rate  of the euros are at the average rate and the remaining of the euros are paid for at the spot rate 
each option  unless used on the first day  will be converted to a forward contract  due when needed during the month at a slight up charge in rate 
during the three and months ended april   we experienced a net gain of  and  respectively  on foreign exchange transactions that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate 
the foreign exchange loss of  for fiscal was the result of unfavorable agreed upon exchange rates with one supplier and is reported net of the gain experienced from our forward contracts 
as of april   we had participating forward options totaling million euros remaining  which were reported as an asset of
