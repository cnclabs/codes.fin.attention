index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of data driven and transaction based marketing and customer loyalty solutions 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions  including customer loyalty programs  database marketing services  marketing strategy consulting  analytics and creative services  permission based email marketing and private label retail credit card programs 
we focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through a variety of consumer marketing channels  including in store  catalog  mail  telephone and on line 
we capture data created during each customer interaction  analyze the data and leverage the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers  as well as to enhance customer loyalty 
we believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as companies continue to shift their marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing campaigns toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments 
we operate in three business segments marketing services  credit services and transaction services 
marketing services 
the marketing services segment generates revenue from our coalition loyalty program in canada and targeted marketing services programs run by epsilon 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and  in limited circumstances  the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyalty services revenue and indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors  who pay us a fee per air miles reward mile issued 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us 
the revenue related to the service element of the air miles reward miles which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors is initially deferred and amortized over a period of months  which is the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption 
air miles reward miles redeemed redemptions show that collectors are redeeming air miles reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs  which is an indicator of the success of the program 
we also recognize revenue from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
the revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
we currently estimate breakage to be one third of air miles reward miles issued 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of a mile or breakage in the periods presented 
our air miles reward program tends not to be significantly impacted by economic swings  because many of our sponsors are in non discretionary retail categories such as grocery stores  gas stations and pharmacies 
additionally  we target the sponsors most loyal customers  who we believe are unlikely to significantly change their spending patterns 
we are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
epsilon is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services 
epsilon has over clients  primarily in the financial services  specialty retail  hospitality and pharmaceutical end markets 
in  we continued our expansion of the services we provide with the acquisition of doubleclick email solutions  which strengthened

index to financial statements our presence in email communication solutions 
with the acquisitions of icom information communications  inc icom  a leading provider of consumer surveys  in early  and cpc associates  inc cpc  a leading provider of new mover data  in the third quarter of  epsilon has also begun to expand its data product and services offerings 
in addition  on february   we completed the acquisition of abacus  which is a leading provider of data  data management and analytical services for the retail and catalog industry  as well as other sectors 
as a result of these acquisitions  we can offer our clients full end to end solutions  including marketing strategy consulting  data services  database development and management  marketing analytics  creative design and delivery services such as email communications 
credit services 
the credit services segment provides risk management solutions  account origination and funding services for our more than private label retail card programs 
credit services primarily generates revenue from securitization income  servicing fees from our securitization trusts and merchant discount fees 
private label credit sales and average managed receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this business unit 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label retail card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average managed receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances  such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
generally we securitize our receivables  which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes the receivables from our balance sheet to one of the securitization trusts 
during the fourth quarter of  the lane bryant portfolio was taken in house by lane bryant s parent company 
the loss of this client will impact our private label sales and our average managed receivables 
it is expected that the loss of the lane bryant portfolio will reduce overall revenue growth to mid to high single digits for in the credit services segment  after which time  it is expected to return to normal levels 
the credit services segment is affected by increased outsourcing in targeted industries 
the growing trend of outsourcing private label retail card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for the securitization trusts 
over the last three years we have experienced a historically low interest rate environment 
however  interest rates in and were slightly higher than rates in during the fourth quarter of  congress enacted bankruptcy legislation which had a two fold impact 
first  an acceleration of bankruptcies occurred in late as the result of an increased number of cardholders filing for bankruptcy protection who would otherwise not have been eligible to file for protection under the new legislation 
second  under the new legislation it became more difficult for cardholders filing for bankruptcy to dispose of their obligations to creditors 
the enactment of the bankruptcy laws had a positive impact in to our net charge off rate  which was approximately for as compared to for the net charge off rate for the year ended december  was and we expect that the net charge off rate for will be in the range with costs of funds expected to remain consistent with

index to financial statements transaction services 
the transaction services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated  customer calls handled and transactions processed 
statements generated is the primary driver of revenue for this segment and represents the majority of revenue 
statements generated this represents the number of statements generated for our credit card and utility clients 
the number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active account holders during that period 
in addition to receiving payment for each statement generated  we also are paid for other services such as remittance processing  customer care and various marketing and consulting services 
the transaction services segment is primarily affected by industry trends similar to credit services 
companies are increasingly outsourcing their non core processes such as customer information systems  billing and customer care 
we are impacted by this trend with our clients in utility services and issuer services 
when there are areas in our business units that no longer align with our strategy  we may explore the sale of those assets

index to financial statements discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance a majority of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
we use our off balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our credit services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an equity interest in the trust and an interest in the receivables 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under gaap and are appropriately not included in our financial statements 
our interest in our securitization program is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller s interest our interest in the receivables and due from securitizations our retained interests and credit enhancement components 
the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the bonds and other debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income 
our retained interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we will receive over the estimated life of the receivables  which is months 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond and note holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimate the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the fair value of the interest only strip  and the corresponding gain or loss  will be impacted by the estimated excess spread over the following two or three quarters 
the excess spread is impacted primarily by finance and late fees collected  net charge offs and interest rates 
changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes of our residual interest 
in recording and accounting for interest only strips  we make assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of principal payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings 
further sensitivity information is provided in note of our audited consolidated financial statements 
we recognize the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale 
the implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus  its initial measure is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements zero at inception 
in addition  we do not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization because management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material 
we believe that servicing fees received represent adequate compensation based on the amount currently demanded by the marketplace 
additionally  these fees are the same as would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required and  thus  we neither record a servicing asset nor servicing liability 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile of months and breakage of one third has remained constant for all periods presented 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile is based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent analysis 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
these influences will primarily affect the average life of an air miles reward mile 
we do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time  consistent with historical trends 
the shortening of the life of an air miles reward mile would accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future

stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using an implied volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense  the future periods may differ from what we have recorded in the current period and could affect our operating income  net income and net income per share

the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of  and guidance surrounding  income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income

inter segment sales our transaction services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our credit services segment 
for this  our transaction services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current estimated market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the credit services segment and corresponding revenue for our transaction services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
revenues earned by our transaction services segment from servicing our credit services segment  and consequently paid by our credit services segment to our transaction services segment  are set forth opposite other eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our results of operations

operating ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to adjusted ebitda plus the change in deferred revenue plus the change in redemption settlement assets 
we have presented operating ebitda because we use the financial measure to monitor compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and our senior note agreement 
for the year ended december   senior debt to operating ebitda was x compared to a maximum ratio of x permitted in our credit facilities and in our senior note agreements 
operating ebitda to interest expense was x compared to a minimum ratio of x permitted in our credit facilities and x permitted in our senior note agreement 
as discussed in more detail in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our credit facilities and cash flows from operations are the two main sources of funding for our acquisition strategy and for our future working

index to financial statements capital needs and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facilities  million under our senior notes and had million in unused borrowing capacity 
we were in compliance with our covenants at december   and we expect to be in compliance with these covenants during the year ended december  we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
the adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda measures presented in this annual report on form k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies  and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements

operating expenses  as defined  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in  and adjusted ebitda margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period in the increased adjusted ebitda margin is the result of favorable revenue trends from an increase in our average managed receivables and an increase in collected yield

delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond days  except in limited circumstances  until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off  typically at days delinquent 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
delinquency rates subsequent to the bankruptcy reform legislation have generally risen as it has become more difficult to file for bankruptcy protection under the law

there is typically a several month lag between the purchase and sale of credit card portfolios 
merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period 
for these purposes  float means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us 
merchant settlement activity fluctuates significantly depending on the day in which the period ends

the bridge loan included an uncommitted accordion feature of up to million allowing for future borrowings  subject to certain conditions 
on july   we entered into a first amendment to the bridge loan to extend the maturity date from july  to december  on december   we entered into a second amendment to the bridge loan which extended the maturity date from december  to march  and eliminated the uncommitted accordion feature  which had allowed for future borrowings up to million  subject to certain conditions 
in addition  the second amendment adjusts the margin applicable to base rate loans and eurodollar loans to those set forth below 
we anticipate renewing or refinancing the bridge loan prior to march  if we are not able to refinance the bridge loan  we would expect to repay the amounts from available cash and borrowings under our consolidated credit facility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program 
we sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to the wfn trusts  qualifying special purpose entities 
the trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total interest incurred was approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   we had billion of debt  including billion of off balance sheet debt from our securitization program 
as of december  fixed rate variable rate total in millions off balance sheet on balance sheet total at december   our fixed rate off balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   our fixed rate on balance sheet debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pretax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pretax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits  as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
a increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pretax income of million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pretax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward 
a increase in the cost of redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pretax income of million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in the cost of redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pretax income
