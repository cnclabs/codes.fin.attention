item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item a 
risk factors and our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we develop  produce and market pharmaceutical delivery products  including transdermal gels  oral disintegrating tablets and reusable needle free and disposable pressure assisted auto injector and pen injector systems 
in addition  we have several products and compound formulations under development 
we have operating facilities in the us and switzerland 
our us operation manufactures and markets reusable needle free injection devices and related disposables  and develops disposable pressure assisted auto injector and pen injector systems 
these operations  including all development and some us administrative activities  are located in minneapolis  minnesota 
we also have operations located in basel  switzerland  which consist of administration and facilities for the development of transdermal gels and oral disintegrating tablet products 
our swiss operations focus principally on research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and include a number of license agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the application of its drug delivery systems 
our corporate offices are located in ewing  new jersey 
we operate as a specialty pharmaceutical company in the broader pharmaceutical industry 
companies in this sector generally bring technology and know how in the area of drug formulation and or delivery to pharmaceutical product marketers through licensing and development agreements while actively pursuing development of their own products 
we currently view pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as our primary customers 
we have negotiated and executed licensing relationships in the growth hormone segment reusable needle free devices in europe and asia  the transdermal gels segment several development programs in place worldwide  including the united states and europe and the oral disintegrating tablet segment 
in addition  we continue to market reusable needle free devices for the home or alternate site administration of insulin in the us market through distributors and have licensed both disposable and reusable injection devices to teva pharmaceuticals for use in undisclosed fields and territories 
we are reporting a net loss of  for the year ended december  and expect to report a net loss for the year ending december   as marketing and development costs related to bringing future generations of products to market continue 
long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the status of collaborative arrangements and payments received under such arrangements  the progress of research and development programs  the receipt of revenues from sales of products and royalties and the ability to control costs 
included in the current year net loss is a net charge to earnings of  recorded in the fourth quarter after we determined eli lilly was no longer committed to development of our product on the previously agreed upon timeline under a development and license agreement  resulting in our conclusion that the carrying value of the prepaid license discount associated with the agreement was impaired 
during we raised net proceeds of  in a private placement of our common stock and received proceeds of  from debt financings 
we believe that the combination of the recent equity and debt financings and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide sufficient funds to support operations beyond additionally  we believe we have the funds required for capital expenditures that may exceed million in in connection with tooling and production equipment related to commercial device deals  and have the funds necessary for the pivotal safety and efficacy trial of anturol tm for overactive bladder which began in critical accounting policies and use of estimates in preparing the financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make decisions that impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
we also enter into license arrangements that are often complex as they may involve a license  development and manufacturing components 
licensing revenue recognition requires significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of revenue recognition for arrangements that include multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
our ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for the deliverable portions of the contracts may significantly impact the time period over which revenues will be recognized 
for instance  if there is no objective fair value of undelivered elements of a contract  then we may be required to treat a multi deliverable contract as one unit of accounting  resulting in all revenue being deferred and recognized over the entire contract period 
eitf does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
for major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of significant revenue amounts  at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
subsequent factors affecting the initial estimate of the effective terms of agreements could either increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
due to the requirement to defer significant amounts of revenue and the extended period over which the revenue will be recognized  along with the requirement to amortize certain deferred development costs over an extended period of time  revenue recognized and cost of revenue may be materially different from cash flows 
in connection with a license agreement entered into with eli lilly and company in  we issued to lilly a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the time of issue  we determined that the fair value of the warrant was  using the black scholes option pricing model 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  requires that the value of the warrants be treated as a reduction in revenue 
the fair value of the warrant was recorded to additional paid in capital and to prepaid license discount  a contra equity account 
the prepaid license discount was being reduced on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  offsetting revenue generated under the agreement 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  the agreement with lilly was amended in march of considering the renegotiations with lilly and drafts of the then pending amendment  we evaluated the prepaid license discount related to the original agreement recorded as contra equity in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet for potential impairment in connection with our preparation and review of the financial statements 
given that lilly was no longer committed to development of our product on the previously agreed upon timeline under the agreement  we determined it was unlikely that future cash flows would be received by us that would exceed the unamortized carrying value  indicating that the recorded prepaid license discount was impaired 
in addition  we determined that capitalized patent costs associated with the agreement had been impaired 
we also recognized related deferred revenue and deferred costs related to the agreement 
accordingly  we recorded a net non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter totaling  consisting principally of the patent impairment charge of  and the impairment of prepaid license discount and related charges of  the patent impairment charge was recorded in general and administrative expense  while the impairment of prepaid license discount and recognition of deferred revenue and deferred costs was recorded in cost of revenue 
the net impact to stockholders equity was an increase of approximately  as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue in excess of deferred costs and patent impairment charges 
on an overall basis  our reported revenues can differ significantly from billings and or accrued billings based on terms in agreements with customers 
the table below is presented to help explain the impact of the deferral of revenue and amortization of prepaid license discount on reported revenues  and is not meant to be a substitute for accounting or presentation requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles 
product sales development fees licensing fees and milestone payments royalties billings received and or accrued per contract terms deferred billings received and or accrued deferred revenue recognized amortization of prepaid license discount total revenue as reported valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets  including patent rights  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this analysis can be very subjective as we rely upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of long lived assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in the fourth quarter of each year we update our long range business plan 
we then review patent costs for impairment and identify patents related to products for which there are no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenues or cash flows were included in the business plan 
in and we recognized impairment charges of  and  respectively  in general and administrative expenses  which represented the gross carrying amount  net of accumulated amortization  for the identified patents 
no impairment charges were recognized in the impairment charge relates to the eli lilly amendment discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
after the impairment charge  the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of patents  which are our only intangible assets subject to amortization  were  and  respectively  at december  and were  and  respectively  at december  the company s estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is  in each of  and   in and  in we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or a sustained significant drop in our stock price 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the minnesota operations to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the minnesota operations exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the minnesota operations would be allocated to all of its other assets and liabilities based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of the minnesota operations over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during  and resulted in no impairment losses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and were primarily due to increases in licensing revenue and product sales 
the licensing revenue increase was mainly due to  and  received in and  respectively  under a sublicense arrangement related to an existing license agreement with biosante pharmaceuticals  inc the increase in product sales in each year was mainly due to an increase in sales to our major customer  ferring 
product sales include sales of reusable needle free injector devices  related parts  disposable components  and repairs 
in  and  revenue from sales of needle free injector devices totaled   and  respectively 
sales of disposable components in  and totaled   and  respectively 
the increases in device and disposable revenue in and were due mainly to increases in sales to ferring 
the increases were primarily due to increases in product quantities sold to ferring in each year 
however  in  a portion of the increase was attributable to a renegotiated contract with ferring in which selling prices were increased 
in addition  as the selling prices of certain products sold to ferring are denominated in euros  the decreasing value of the us dollar against the euro in resulted in an increase in revenue compared to the increases in product sales to ferring in and followed two years of decreasing sales that occurred while ferring was working down high inventory levels they had accumulated in prior years 
development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue in was attributable primarily to an agreement related to our oral disintegrating tablet technology  along with recognized revenue in connection with our proprietary atd gel technology 
the revenue in was attributable to projects related to injector systems and transdermal gel technologies  but resulted primarily from one agreement related to use of our proprietary atd gel technology 
in we also generated development fees of approximately  in connection with an agreement related to our oral disintegrating tablet technology  all of which was deferred and was recognized as revenue in in approximately half of the development revenue was generated from projects related to injector devices  with most of this coming from one time projects 
the remainder of the recognized development revenue in was generated under licensing and development agreements related to use of our transdermal gel technology 
licensing revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the licensing revenue in and was primarily due to  and  respectively  received under a sublicense arrangement related to an existing license agreement with biosante pharmaceuticals  inc in november biosante entered into a marketing agreement with bradley pharmaceuticals  inc for elestrin formerly bio e gel 
biosante received an upfront payment from bradley which triggered a payment to us of  in december the fda approved for marketing elestrin in the united states triggering the payments of  received in in addition  we have begun to receive royalties on sales of elestrin and may receive potential sales based milestone payments in the future 
royalty revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
nearly all royalty revenue has been related to the vision reusable needle free injection device  and has been generated primarily under the license agreement with ferring dated january   described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
royalties from ferring are earned on device sales and under a provision in the ferring agreement in which royalties are triggered by the achievement of certain quality standards 
the increase in was primarily related to the increase in the number of injector devices sold to ferring  as well as a renegotiated increased royalty rate with ferring 
the increase in was due to increases both in royalties earned from device sales and in the royalty earned under the quality standards provision 
cost of revenues the costs of product sales are primarily related to reusable injection devices and disposable components 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in was mainly the result of an increase in selling prices to ferring 
the decrease in was due to a combination of factors including a change in the mix of products sold and a higher sales volume absorbing a slightly decreased level of fixed overhead costs 
the cost of development revenue consists of labor costs  direct external costs and an allocation of certain overhead expenses based on actual costs and time spent in these revenue generating activities 
cost of development revenue as a percentage of development revenue can fluctuate considerably between periods depending on the development projects in process 
in some cases development projects are substantially labor based  resulting in relatively high margins  while in other cases development projects include a significant amount of external cost passed through to the customer at little or no markup  resulting in lower margins 
cost of development revenue as a percentage of development revenue was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to an increased average hourly billing rate  due primarily to one project which was the source of the majority of the development revenue for the year 
the percentage decrease in was primarily due to projects having fewer external costs that were billed to customers with little or no markup 
impairment of prepaid license discount of  partially offset by recognizing deferred revenue net of deferred costs  resulted in a net non cash impairment charge of  in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we determined it was unlikely that future cash flows from the lilly agreement would exceed the unamortized prepaid license discount recorded as contra equity in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
in addition  we determined that the carrying value of related capitalized patent costs of  was impaired  and is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations 
research and development the majority of research and development expenses consist of external costs for studies and analysis activities  design work and prototype development 
while we are typically engaged in research and development activities involving each of our drug delivery platforms  over of the total research and development expenses in each year were generated in connection with projects related to transdermal gels and oral disintegrating tablet products 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the initiation of a phase iii study of anturol tm oxybutynin gel for the treatment of overactive bladder 
the overall increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  sales  marketing and business development sales  marketing and business development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to increases in payroll and legal fees 
the payroll increases were partially due to the addition of personnel and the legal fees increases were due to increased activity as a result of new license  development and or supply agreements that were completed or in process at year end 
the increase in compared to was due mainly to an increase in professional services in connection with business development projects related to transdermal gels and oral disintegrating tablets  along with an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due mainly to the patent impairment charge of  related to the lilly agreement  along with increases in other patent related expenses 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  along with an increase in patent impairment charges of  the patent impairment charges were recognized after we determined it was unlikely that future cash flows would exceed the net carrying value of the capitalized patent costs 
the impairment charges represented the gross carrying amount net of accumulated amortization for the identified patent costs 
other income expense other income expense  net  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  interest income increased to  from  in due mainly to investment of the net proceeds from issuance of common stock of  the exercise of warrants and options of  and the debt financing of  the debt financing resulted in an increase in interest expense and was the primary reason interest expense increased by  which offset the increase in interest income and resulted in an overall decrease in other income 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from investment of the proceeds from the private placement of common stock in the first quarter of  partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange losses related mainly to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on liabilities due in foreign currencies 
liquidity and capital resources we have not historically generated  and do not currently generate  enough revenue to provide the cash needed to support our operations  and have continued to operate primarily by raising capital and incurring debt 
in order to better position ourselves to take advantage of potential growth opportunities and to fund future operations  during we raised additional capital and received proceeds from debt financings 
in july of we received net proceeds of  in a private placement of our common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
in connection with the private placement  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
in we also received proceeds of  in connection with warrant and stock option exercises which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in february of  we received gross proceeds of  upon closing of the first tranche of a  credit facility  to help fund working capital needs 
in december of we received gross proceeds of  after we amended the credit facility agreement to reduce the amount available to draw down in the second tranche from  to  the per annum interest rate is in the case of the first tranche and in the case of the second tranche 
the maturity date i with respect to the first tranche is forty two months from the first funding date and ii with respect to the second tranche is thirty six months from the second funding date 
the credit agreement is secured by all personal property of the company  including all intellectual property 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants and provisions  including  without limitation  covenants and provisions that restrict our ability to create or incur indebtedness subject to enumerated exceptions  restrict our ability to create or incur certain liens on our property subject to enumerated exceptions  in certain circumstances  require us to maintain  on a consolidated basis  unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least  in certain circumstances  restrict our ability to declare or pay any dividends on any shares of our capital stock  purchase or redeem any shares of our capital stock  return any capital to any holder of our equity securities or payment of certain bonuses  restrict our ability to make certain investments 
in connection with the credit facility  we issued warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of we believe that the combination of the recent debt and equity financings and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide sufficient funds to support operations beyond we anticipate that capital expenditures may increase to over million in  primarily in connection with tooling and production equipment related to commercial device deals 
we do not currently have any bank credit lines 
if we do need additional financing and are unable to obtain such financing when needed  or obtain it on favorable terms  we may be required to curtail development of new drug technologies  limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as we may desire 
net cash used in operating activities operating cash inflows are generated primarily from product sales  license and development fees and royalties 
operating cash outflows consist principally of expenditures for manufacturing costs  general and administrative costs  research and development projects and sales  marketing and business development activities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this was primarily the result of net losses of   and  in  and  respectively  adjusted by noncash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash expenses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was mainly due to the impairment charges related to the lilly agreement  including the prepaid license discount impairment and amortization charge of  and the patent rights impairment charge of  in addition  noncash expenses increased in due to amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of  which began in as a result of the debt financing during the year 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in noncash stock based compensation expense of nearly million  which was principally due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in in  the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of  this was due primarily to a decrease in deferred revenue of  which was mainly the result of eliminating the deferred revenue related to the lilly agreement 
other changes included increases in prepaid expenses of  and other assets of  which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  the increases in prepaid expenses and other assets were the result of costs incurred in connection with development projects related mainly to injector devices and anturol tm 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to compensation related accruals such as vacation and bonuses  along with accruals for project costs and certain professional fees 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of  this was primarily the net result of increases in accounts receivable of  and deferred revenue of  both increases reflect the increase in revenue generating activity in compared to the accounts receivable increase was due to an increase in product sales activity  royalties and development revenue near the end of as compared to in the amount received from license fees  development fees and milestone payments increased compared to  as did the portion of these payments that was deferred and is being recognized as revenue over various periods 
the change in operating assets and liabilities in generated cash of  this resulted mainly from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased research and development activities near the end of the year  particularly in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels  and increased accruals related to executive bonuses 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  which utilized cash of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was almost entirely due to payments made in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels 
the reduction in deferred revenue was the result of recognizing as revenue amounts that had previously been deferred  which exceeded amounts deferred during the year totaling approximately  net cash provided by used in investing activities investing activities are comprised primarily of short term investment purchases and maturities 
all short term investments are commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that mature within six to twelve months of purchase and are classified as held to maturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
in and the use of cash to purchase securities exceeded cash generated from maturities by  and  respectively  due primarily to the investment of excess funds from the private placements in each of those years and in the debt financing provided additional funds for investment 
in  maturities exceeded purchases by  as cash was required to fund operations and was not available for reinvestment 
investing activities in  and also included additions to patent rights of   and  respectively  and purchases of equipment  furniture and fixtures of   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in we received net proceeds of  from the private placement of common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
in addition  in we received proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants and stock options and received proceeds of  from debt financings 
in cash was used for debt principal payments and debt issuance costs  which totaled  and  respectively 
in  we received  from the exercise of warrants and stock options and received net proceeds of  from the private placement of common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
in  we received  from the sale of common stock and  from the exercise of warrants  which was partially offset by the payment of preferred stock dividends of  our contractual cash obligations at december  are associated with long term debt  capital and operating leases and are summarized in the following table payment due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt  including interest capital leases  including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including any arrangements with any structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the provisions of sfas r are effective beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in june  eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf was issued 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf will be effective beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
furthermore  sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the swiss franc to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of our subsidiaries in switzerland are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to our swiss subsidiaries in swiss francs 
in addition  we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the licensing agreement entered into in january with ferring  which established pricing in euros for products sold under the supply agreement and for all royalties 
in march we amended the agreement with ferring  establishing prices in us dollars rather than euros for certain products  reducing the exchange rate risk 
most of our sales and licensing fees are denominated in us dollars  thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
because exposure increases as intercompany balances grow  we will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results for the years ended december   and was not material 
typically  our short term investments are commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that mature within six to twelve months of purchase 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument is expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio
