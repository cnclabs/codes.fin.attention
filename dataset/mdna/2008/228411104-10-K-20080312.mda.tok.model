item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information regarding subscriber fees 
for the years ended december    and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
an additional form of television advertising is direct response advertising  which is designed to elicit a specific and quantifiable response from the viewer 
unlike spot advertising  fees payable for this form of advertising are measured by viewer response to advertising  such as product purchases  rather than the viewer ratings which measures success in programming 
hallmark channel advertising revenue is comprised primarily of spot advertising  while the hallmark movie channel has no measured ratings  and therefore its revenue is comprised primarily of direct response revenue 
we will begin to receive ratings for the hallmark movie channel in april the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our channel typically sells approximately of its advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units adus  essentially deferring revenue  and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for advertising purchased in programs which did not deliver the ratings which the advertisers had been guaranteed 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for information on a new ratings based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
throughout the fourth quarter  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately to under the new ratings 
as pay television channels draw audience share  audience demographics ie viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  sex and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products  by buying advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we have advertising sales offices in new york  los angeles  chicago  and atlanta 
in addition  we have made significant investments in programming  research  marketing and promotions  all specifically designed to support the sale of advertising time on our channels 
for the years ended december    and revenue from the sale of advertising time on our channels were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market in  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day viewership with an average household rating for the year and th for prime time with an average household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day viewership with an average household rating and th for prime time with an average household rating  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to the average median age of a viewer of the hallmark channel in was and in licensing revenue until we sold our domestic library to rhi entertainment llc on december   we licensed our film assets to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who paid a license fee for the right to exhibit or distribute the programming over a certain period of time 
programming our channels offer a range of high quality entertainment programming for adults and families including popular television series  movies  miniseries  theatricals  romances  literary classics  and contemporary stories

we benefit from original productions  whether they have aired on other networks or are premiered on our channel 
examples of other third party programming shown on our channel include the popular drama series m a s h  little house on the prairie  th heaven  matlock  walker texas ranger  and murder she wrote 
other examples of our third party programming include acquired movies and miniseries such as miss congeniality  troy  willy wonka and the chocolate factory  and the bridges of madison county 
our license agreements with third parties typically provide for a license fee paid out over the term of the license for the right to exhibit a program in the united states within a specified period of time 
our channels air and benefit from programming previously shown as hallmark hall of fame such as john grisham s painted house  the magic of ordinary days  back when we were grownups  sarah  plain and tall and what the deaf man heard 
we have rights to a number of original movies and mini series under our programming agreement with rhi entertainment distribution 
see hallmark entertainment distribution rhi entertainment distribution programming agreement in item certain relationships and related transactions 
we have sublicensed exhibition rights to several programs for through in order to save on programming costs

for over fifty years hallmark has been a leader in high quality original television production 
the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel are the only major cable television channels which broadcast the movies previously shown as hallmark hall of fame  a selection of movies from an award winning entertainment series 
the power of the hallmark brand and the quality of our programming combine to provide our viewers with tangible evidence of our commitment to the best in entertainment for the entire family  enhance our ability to attract advertising commitments and higher cost per thousands cpm from the largest advertisers  and provide a competitive advantage in negotiating long term distribution agreements with pay television distributors 
crown media holdings currently uses the websites www 
hallmarkchannel 
com and www 
hallmarkmoviechannel 
com to promote the channels and their programs  and to provide information to potential viewers 
these websites support major programming events such as original movie premieres and major acquisitions as well as contain information regarding the channel s program schedule  detailed information on the channel s programs and their stars 
further  the sites provide platforms for viewer participation in the channels sweepstakes promotions and community areas 
the sites have advertiser imaging including banner messages and video content 
channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically created by the company s employees  but are occasionally outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the channels 
occasionally  these interstitials are sponsored by advertisers  resulting in additional advertising revenue 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscribers of the channels 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes of the hallmark channel s programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in denver  colorado  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to an uplink facility in littleton  colorado 
the hallmark movie channel has the daily log and digital tapes of commercials and promotional messages delivered to a third party network operations center in los angeles  california for hd  and in denver  colorado for sd  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to an uplink facility in littleton  colorado 
the uplink facility combines the hallmark channel s programming with hallmark movie channel hd and sd 
the uplink facility then transmits the combined signals to a satellite transponder that covers the united states 
the transponder transmits the signal back to cable head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channels to their subscribers

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels have competed for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  oxygen  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees at december   we had distribution agreements with charter  comcast  cox  directv  echostar  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber fee increases over time 
see risk factors relating to our business below 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as court tv  abc  cbs sports  fox family  discovery channel  amc and usa networks 
competitive risks one primary channel distributed domestically we operate only two channels  one of which  the hallmark movie channel  has been in operation for only a short period of time 
many of our competitors have more than two channels and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 
entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings are a significant positive factor 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affect rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channels to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel 
employees we had employees at december   and employees at december  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
our channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve an operating profit or sustain a positive cash flow 
if we are not able to do so  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable before interest expense and to have a positive cash flow  we will need to increase our advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  maintaining the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to maintain subscriber levels and enhance our programming  which may result in increased costs for programming 
over the last five years  these actions have contributed to increased net losses for crown media holdings 
to achieve the positive net income  we would also need to decrease our interest expense by reducing our outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was billion  and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility subject to the approval of our board of directors to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek equity or debt financing from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
information concerning our liquidity may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  increased over the past year 
the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due in part to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures  but primarily from interest accretion on the outstanding indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
because we currently operate at a loss  we may have a negative cash flow and any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
we have no arrangements for any such additional external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing creditors 
further  as discussed in this report under liquidity and capital resources below  we need to extend  refinance or replace our credit facility on or prior to may   or to extend or replace borrowings from hallmark cards by may   that would result from the banks drawing upon the irrevocable letter of credit supporting the bank credit facility or from hallmark cards purchasing the loans under that facility see note to our consolidated financial statements  and extend or refinance outstanding notes payables to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries on or prior to their due dates december  for three obligations  july for the tax note and august in the case of the note  as described later in this report 
upon maturity of the credit facility on may   jp morgan chase bank has the right to elect to forego the receipt of cash to pay the principal amount of the credit facility in full  which is provided for under the terms of an irrevocable letter of credit provided by hallmark cards described in note but instead can elect to initiate a process to foreclose on the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings  which we view as a remote possibility  would affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company would consider various alternatives 
in the alternative  the company would cause hallmark cards  pursuant to the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement  to exercise its option to purchase the bank s interest in the credit facility and the bank credit facility would then be payable to hallmark cards upon demand after march  most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or increased cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve improved results 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  ii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  iii our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  iv the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording which may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or v we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity deficit could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are not held by affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
additionally  the national interfaith cable coalition nicc owns approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock 
prior to entering into a new agreement on january   certain programming and other commitments in then existing agreements with nicc would have terminated upon the sale of or more of the shares of class a common stock owned by nicc 
on january   we and nicc entered into a new agreement superseding prior agreements and terminating most programming relationships with nicc 
as a result  nicc may feel more free to sell its class a common stock  which could have an adverse impact on the share price of our class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the proposed change in television ratings in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
in  nielsen has modified its ratings system by increasing its household sample size and plans to institute other changes in its audience measurement systems 
these modifications have not negatively impacted our ratings to date 
in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
as the impact of the changes continue to take effect  our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the nature of the changes in the measurement systems 
nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels with lower viewership  such as our channels  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channels without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and operating results  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect our distribution and thus our revenue 
the federal communications commission or congress may enact requirements that cable program services be offered to subscribers on an a la carte basis  ie be made available for purchase separately and not as part of a package of services or that the services be offered in specific packages such as a so called family tier 
such requirements could result in a reduction in the total number of subscribers to our program services and adversely affect advertising revenue

with million subscribers as provided by nielsen research in the united states at december   the hallmark channel is the th most widely distributed advertising supported cable channel in the united states 
for the fourth quarter of  the hallmark channel finished the quarter as the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel for total day ratings and the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel in prime time as measured by nielsen research 
we launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of programming on the hallmark movie channel consists of movies and mini series  including programming from rhi films  programming from the hallmark hall of fame collection  hallmark channel original movies  and other programming acquired from third parties 
the hallmark movie channel generated advertising revenue in  and as distribution continues to expand  the financial contribution of the hallmark movie channel may grow  including increases in advertising and subscription revenue 
the hallmark movie channel is operated through crown media holdings existing infrastructure at a small incremental cost 
in april  we will begin distributing the hallmark movie channel hd in high definition format  which will result in additional costs  but is expected to result in incremental subscriber growth

current challenges and developments the hallmark channel faces numerous operating challenges 
among them are maintaining and expanding the distribution of the channels  broadening viewership demographics  increasing viewership ratings  and increasing advertising sales revenue 
distribution agreements are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and the rates charged for advertising 
the current and long term distribution challenges are renewing our distribution arrangements with the multiple system operators as they expire on favorable terms 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from december   and with options to renew through december since january   through the date of this report  the company has renewed its agreements with five major distributors  accounting for of our subscriber base at december  each renewal agreement has a multi year term 
one of those renewal agreements in march  is with echostar communication corporation 
it provided for a repositioning of the hallmark channel on the dish network  resulting in an addition of approximately million nielsen subscribers in may  and for carrying the hallmark movie channel on a package of the dish network  increasing distribution of that channel by more than million subscribers 
we executed in may  a renewal of our distribution agreement with the national cable television cooperative nctc 
under the terms of the renewal  we continue to be available to nctc s  member companies 
in november   we executed a renewal agreement with comcast corporation  providing comcast with rights to distribute the hallmark channel  the hallmark movie channel and the hallmark movie channel hd 
in february and march  we renewed distribution agreements for the hallmark channel with time warner cable and directv for multi year terms 
an agreement with a distributor  representing of our subscribers  remains in negotiations 
our agreements with major distributors contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor  subject to various exceptions and conditions 
these clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees  launch support  local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions 
we take these provisions into account when renewing agreements 
domestic telephone companies have entered the business of distributing television channels to households through their wire lines 
we have agreements with several telephone companies and cooperatives of telephone companies  which permit the carriage of the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel  and are negotiating with others 
we believe that subscribers to these telephone services are in large part customers previously served by cable and satellite television companies  which continue to carry our programming 
the universe of cable tv subscribers in the united states is approximately million homes 
the top cable tv networks in the united states have million or more subscribers 
our goal is to reach million subscribers in the next one to two years 
three factors have contributed to the ratings of the hallmark channel acquired series and movies  original productions and marketing 
certain acquired series have consistently delivered strong ratings across all day parts 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the channel s highest ratings 
original productions are significant in helping our distribution and advertising sales teams sell the channel 
prior to  substantially all of our original programming has been provided by rhi entertainment 
in  we started to acquire original programming from a broad range of producers and expect to continue in the future 
the company typically incurs additional marketing expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies 
we sold approximately of our inventory for advertising on our channels in the upfront market generally sales in june  july and august for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  compared to sold in the upfront market 
we were able to achieve significant increases in our cpms in the upfront market compared to the upfront market 
the balance of advertising inventory has been made available in the scatter market  which in the past and in has yielded higher advertising rates than the upfront market 
historically  nielsen cable television ratings were based on viewing of networks programming content 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
the new ratings information also includes data on viewing of program content through digital recording devices dvr s  if that viewing occurs within three days of the program s air date 
throughout the fourth quarter  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately to under the new ratings 
we have factored the new rating information into our advertising rates  and at this time we do not expect a significant impact from the new rating information on our net advertising rates 
at december   the hallmark movie channel was distributed to nearly million subscribers  an increase of nearly million subscribers in this increase in distribution will improve the company s ability to generate advertising revenue from the hallmark movie channel in the company expects the hallmark movie channel to become a more significant component of its advertising revenue in international business please see note in our consolidated financial statements sale of the international business of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
sale of membership interests in crown media distribution please see note in our consolidated financial statements sale of membership interests in crown media distribution of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
impairment of assets please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on impairment charges for and revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees and advertising fees  and until december  included film asset license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
in the past  we have paid certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
rates we receive per subscriber vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms and length of the contract term 
we are in continuous negotiations with our existing distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising results 
we have been subject in the past to requests by major distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees our channels are usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and are not generally offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which one of our channels is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channels alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead  we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the channels 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying one of our channels and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
the level of subscribers could also be affected by a distributor repositioning our channels from one tier to another tier 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenue and costs 
based upon these analyses  if subscriber acquisition fees are needed  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees 
advertising our advertising rates are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
film asset license fees crown media distribution generated revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to third parties to exhibit the films in the united states 
we also used the films as programming for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
customers for our film assets consisted of other television channels  home video distributors and brokers who resold rights to our film assets 
license fees for our film assets were generally negotiated based upon  among other things  the size of the potential audience who were to be viewing the programming and the term of the license 
the market for our film library was typically seasonal  with over half of the annual sales occurring in the fourth quarter in past years 
this seasonality was generally due to the timing of our customers program scheduling activities 
in  film licensing activities and revenue were negatively affected by the sale process of the company s film library  which sale closed in december due to the sale of the company s film library  we no longer have film licensing activities 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the amortization of program license fees  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  administration  distribution and  until we sold our film assets  amortization of and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future due to the amortization of programming to support our advertising strategy 
we expect this increase to be offset in part by a decrease in subscriber acquisition fee expense as we continue to renew our distribution deals 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenue 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenue and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis blocks of time during the day as it pertains to programming licensed to a channel 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenue are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs are recognized 
subscriber acquisition fees subscriber acquisition fees have been generally required to be paid to obtain initial carriage on domestic pay distributors systems 
under certain of these agreements with pay distributors  crown media united states was obligated to pay subscriber acquisition fees if defined subscriber levels were met or in order to obtain additional carriage of the hallmark channel by those pay distributors 
such costs were accrued when crown media united states received notice from the distributors that they have met the contractual penetration percentage or subscriber count 
subscriber acquisition fees are amortized over the contractual life of the distribution agreements as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the cumulative subscriber fee revenue recognized  or to be recognized  on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
crown media holdings assesses the recoverability of these costs periodically by comparing the net carrying amount to the estimates of future subscriber fee and advertising revenue 
it also assesses the recoverability when events such as changes in distributor relationships occur or other indicators suggest impairment 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on november or whenever an event occurs or there is a change in circumstances that indicates fair value might be below carrying value 
goodwill is carried at historical cost if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amounts 
however  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is reduced to estimated fair value through an impairment charge to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition subscriber revenue from pay television distributors is recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recorded net of amortization of subscriber acquisition costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
advertising revenue  net of agency commissions  is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for the company s broadcasting operations 
customers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue 
audience deficiency unit liability audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for the inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
an audience deficiency liability results when impressions delivered on guaranteed ratings are less than the impressions guaranteed to advertisers 
such liability arises as a matter of industry practice rather than as a matter of written contract 
the liability is reduced when the company airs the advertisement during another program to make good on the under delivery of impressions 
the company typically does not remit cash to advertisers in satisfaction of such deficiencies 
effects of transactions with related and certain other parties hallmark transactions in to date and in prior years  we entered into a number of significant transactions with hallmark cards and its subsidiaries 
these transactions include  among other things  trademark licenses  administrative services  a tax sharing agreement  the issuance of a million senior note  notes payable and a debt waiver agreement

to date  hallmark cards has been paying of such tax benefits in cash and  from time to time  applying the balance to amounts owed by the company to a hallmark member 
in  the internal revenue service completed its examination of hallmark cards consolidated tax returns filed for fiscal years and and determined that  with respect to a portion of the losses attributable to the company for fiscal years and  hallmark cards should not have carried back such losses to its consolidated federal tax returns filed for fiscal years and these losses are now available as carry forwards in the consolidated federal tax return beginning in and later years 
since hallmark card s tax benefits realized from such losses were either paid to the company in cash or applied as an offset against amounts owed to a hallmark member as described above  the company now has to reimburse hallmark cards for the portion of the tax benefits received by the company attributable to its losses for fiscal years and  along with any interest related thereto  which amount is approximately million

primetime is defined as pm in the united states 
these nielsen ratings are for the time period january through december results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations  which is primarily comprised of subscriber fees and advertising  increased to million for the year ended december  our increase to million in subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   was a result of higher net effective rates on average  primarily due to a decrease in subscriber acquisition fees applied against revenue  and an increase in the number of paying subscribers 
subscriber acquisition fee expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in  primarily due to the renewal of distribution agreements and the resulting reversal of certain subscriber acquisition fees associated with the previous agreements during the first quarter of subscriber fees were also positively impacted by the expiration of free carriage periods during and subscribers have increased as a result of the echostar distribution agreement signed in march and as a result of internal growth pursuant to previously amended distribution agreements 
net subscriber rates in distribution agreements renewed during and to date should significantly increase subscriber fees in the increase in advertising revenue to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   reflects the growth in subscribers and an increase in advertising rates  offset in part by lower than expected delivery of viewers in certain demographic categories 
generally  as we have expanded our subscribers  provided higher rated programming  and increased our advertising rates  our advertising revenue has increased 
the number of advertisers on our channel rose from at december   to at december  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day viewership with a household rating for the year ended december  and th for primetime with a household rating for the same period based on nielsen ratings 
this ratings performance is significant  particularly because the hallmark channel is not a fully distributed network and most of the channels that rate above the hallmark channel have higher levels of distribution 
revenue from the licensing of our film assets totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to for the year 
the company sold its film assets in december the company recorded  of sublicense fees and other revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to in the prior year s period 
this decrease was primarily related to the million impairment of our film assets recorded in explained below 
total programming costs for the year ended december   increased due to continued increases in the market cost of program licenses and expensing certain related party programming after the one airing instead of over a period of or years 
significant nicc programming expenses are eliminated in  and we plan to use these savings for other programming 
amortization of film assets decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same periods in  because there was no licensing of film assets in in addition  during the second quarter of  the company reduced its estimate of a residual and participation liability for  less than it had originally accrued for it in conjunction with the sale of its film library 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded million negative amortization of film assets related to a change in estimate of the company s residual and participation liability resulting from an analysis of the company s third party licenses and use of the film assets prior to the sale to rhi using information that became available during the third quarter of non cash impairment charges were million related to our film assets for the year ended december  subscriber acquisition fee amortization expense results when subscriber acquisition costs previously incurred are amortized over the remaining life of the relevant distribution agreement 
we expect this expense to decline in  as we renewed our agreements in and without committing to additional subscriber acquisition fees 
operating costs for the year ended december   decreased  primarily due to decreases in expenses associated with the library  such as outside sales commission and tape duplication 
the decrease also resulted from the full year benefit in of expense reduction efforts made in the first and second quarter of this decrease was offset by the company s negative bad debt expense meaning a credit  which is a part of operating costs and causes a decrease in such costs  of  for the year ended december   as compared to the company s bad debt expense of  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense increased due to a million increase and a million increase in compensation expense related to the obligations of restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights  respectively  a million increase in commissions expense  a million increase in legal expense  a million increase in bonus expense  a  increase in research expense and other miscellaneous increases 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to assets becoming fully depreciated and a million decrease in severance expense 
our closing stock prices are used to value both our restricted stock units and our stock appreciation rights  and increases decreases in our closing stock price cause increases decreases in our compensation expense 
our closing stock price was at december   and at december  marketing expense 
for the year ended december   our marketing expense increased 
usually  the company has five marketing promotions per year 
during  there were only four marketing promotions due to management s cost savings efforts 
the four marketing promotions were mystery movies in january  desolation canyon in july  march of the penguins in november and the christmas card in december during  there were five marketing promotions 
the five marketing promotions were love is a four letter word in february  a stranger s heart in may  avenging angel in july  all i want for christmas in december and the note in december interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased for the year ended december   compared to december   by million 
this increase relates primarily to the million of interest expense recorded in the second quarter of in connection with the million of tax benefits received earlier from hallmark cards under the tax sharing agreement

see bank credit facility and hallmark notes below 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash generated by operations and amounts available under the company s revolving bank credit facility through may  in addition  in march  the company and hallmark cards entered into an amended and restated waiver agreement which changes the maturity date of three obligations and defers payments under certain obligations 
see note previously  the company s tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards has also been a source of cash 
however  we do not expect to receive or pay any cash related to this agreement in the next twelve months 
the company expects to continue making investments in programming  marketing and distribution during however  the company s recurring loss situation has demanded that all areas of expenses  including programming  marketing and distribution be closely monitored and controlled 
the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and borrowing availability under its bank credit facility through may   when combined with the deferral of any required payments on related party debt and related interest mentioned below  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and meet its liquidity needs through march  the company anticipates that its principal uses of cash during the next twelve months will continue to include the payment of operating expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses  license fees for programming  interest and repayment of principal under its bank credit facility and interest under certain notes payable to hallmark cards affiliates 
the sufficiency of the existing sources of liquidity to fund the company s operations is dependent upon continued growth in subscriber revenue and advertising revenue 
a significant decline in the popularity of the hallmark channel  an adverse modification of any of the company s significant distribution agreements  an economic decline in the advertising market  an increase in program acquisition costs  an increase in competition or other adverse changes in operating conditions could negatively impact the company s liquidity and its ability to fund the current level of operations 
the company will endeavor to extend or refinance the bank credit facility prior to or upon its maturity 
any such extension or refinancing could require a continuation of a letter of credit from hallmark cards in support of the bank credit facility or other steps by the company and  thus  is not assured 
if the company is not able to arrange for the extension  refinancing or replacement of the bank credit facility prior to its maturity and either the bank draws down on hallmark cards irrevocable letter of credit or hallmark cards purchases the interests of the lending bank  hallmark cards would have all obligations and rights of the lending banks under the bank credit facility 
in that event  hallmark cards could demand payment of outstanding amounts at any time after march   under the terms of the waiver agreement described below 
upon maturity of the credit facility on may   without renewal or replacement  jp morgan chase bank  na  will have the right to forego a call on hallmark cardsf irrevocable letter of credit provided and instead initiate foreclosure against the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings would adversely affect our ability to continue our operations 
however  prior to any such possible foreclosure  if the company had not secured a refunding of the credit facility or alternative financing  the company would require hallmark cards to exercise its option pursuant to the terms of the waiver agreement to purchase all of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility 
the credit facility would then be subject to terms of the waiver agreement 
because of the company s possible inability to meet its obligations when they come due on march  and later dates in through december   the company anticipates that prior to march  it will be necessary to either extend or refinance i the bank credit facility and ii the promissory notes payable to affiliates of hallmark cards described in the notes below 
as part of a combination of actions and in order to obtain additional funding  the company may consider various alternatives  including refinancing the bank credit facility  raising additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities  or other strategic alternatives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations or can be used to reduce borrowings under our credit facility based on the maturity schedule of loans under that agreement 
consequently  the size of this portfolio is nominal and fluctuates as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
if we use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or less than of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of our bank credit facility  our line of credit and interest payable to hc crown  our line of credit and interest payable to hallmark cards affiliate  our note and interest payable to hallmark cards affiliate  and our tax note and interest payable to hallmark cards 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by from levels as of december   our interest expense would increase or decrease by million
