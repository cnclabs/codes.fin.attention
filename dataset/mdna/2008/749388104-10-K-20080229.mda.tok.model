sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of infant and toddler products  preschool products and youth and adult products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers

our products are marketed and distributed primarily in north america  europe  australia and asia pacific 
international sales  defined as sales outside of north america  constituted  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to increase as we expand our geographic reach 
net sales in our international segment increased for the year ended december   which includes a benefit in changes from currency exchange rates 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers 
our top three customers combined accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales to each of the company s largest customers for the years ended december   and  as a percentage of the company s total net sales in each of the respective years is as follows year ended december  wal mart target toys r us babies r us no other customers accounted for more than of the company s net sales in any of the years ended december   or we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany  with credit terms generally ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually

our purchases of finished products from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
as a result  any material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar or the renminbi relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses and  therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
additionally  if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
for example  increases in the price of zinc  a key component in die cast products  and increased costs in china  primarily for labor  reduced our gross margins in and and may continue to reduce our gross margins in our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
our infant and toddler products category has higher sales of non licensed products that carry lower selling prices and gross margins than our preschool products and youth and adult products categories 
additionally  individual product lines within each category carry gross margins that vary significantly and cause quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of these individual shipments throughout the year
