item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global manufacturing service provider of technologically advanced printed circuit boards pcbs for original equipment manufacturer oem customers and their electronic manufacturing service ems providers 
our principal products are complex multi layer rigid pcbs  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
the market segments we serve are primarily in commercial equipment in the communications and networking  computing and peripherals  test  industrial and medical  defense and aerospace and automotive markets 
our markets are generally characterized by rapid technological change  high levels of complexity and short product life cycles  as new and technologically superior electronic equipment is continually being developed 
electronic equipment progresses through a product life cycle with stages that require differing manufacturing capabilities 
in the design phase  the customer requires very compressed lead times to shorten their products time to market 
ramping to volume  the customer requires flexibility and high quality production and as the product matures the customer requires high quality  reliable  low cost manufacturing 
historically  manufacturers procured pcbs from multiple vendors in various geographies to meet the requirements of a product s life cycle 
each pcb vendor transition introduces incremental time  cost and risk 
today  our strategy is to offer global pcb manufacturing to our customers with quick turn and volume high technology production in the united states as well as lower cost production solutions in asia 
this capability is the foundation of our unique value proposition that provides a seamless interface for our customers as their products transition life cycles which minimizes their risk and cost and reduces time to market 
we fulfill our value proposition by leveraging the following manufacturing facilities merix oregon our oregon manufacturing facility provides quality quick turn and volume manufacturing services for mid to high technology pcbs 
merix san jose our san jose manufacturing facility is ideally located in silicon valley to provide quick turn manufacturing services for design and prototype applications of mid to high technology pcbs 
merix asia our asian manufacturing facilities give us access to the growing lower cost asian manufacturing environments 
we have two facilities located in china 
our factory in huizhou provides high quality lower technology pcbs primarily to automotive customers  while our huiyang facility is targeted at mid to high technology production and is more closely aligned with our capabilities in the united states 
in order to more closely align our manufacturing facilities with our strategic objectives  in fiscal we undertook certain restructuring programs more fully described under the heading severance  impairment and restructuring charges below 
in fiscal we also commenced an expansion of our huiyang facility in china which when complete will significantly increase the technological capabilities to better match the technology requirements of our north american and european customer bases and will more than double our production capacity in china 

table of contents operating segments today  our business has three operating segments merix oregon  merix san jose and merix asia 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly reviewed by senior management 
each operating segment operates predominately in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for our global customers 
the chief decision maker for all of our operating segments is our chief executive officer 
markets and customers the following table presents the percentage of net sales  by segment  for significant customers comprising greater than of total net sales cisco motorola merix oregon merix san jose merix asia consolidated less than approximately  and  respectively  of our oem sales in fiscal  and were made to ems providers 
although our contractual relationship is with the ems provider  most of our shipments to ems providers are directed by oems that negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us 
in addition  we are on the approved vendor list of several ems providers and are awarded incremental discretionary orders directly from some of them 
we expect these discretionary orders to increase in the future as we strengthen our direct relationships with these ems providers 
backlog backlog comprises purchase orders received and  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
backlog shippable within the next days totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in backlog was driven primarily by an increase in lead times for merix oregon as a result of the closure of our wood village facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal customers may cancel or postpone all scheduled orders  in most cases without penalty 
therefore  backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future financial results 

table of contents results of operations fiscal consisted of weeks  whereas fiscal and fiscal each consisted of weeks 
accordingly  the results of operations for fiscal contain one additional week of activity as compared to fiscal and fiscal the following table sets forth our results of operations in thousands

our results of operations in fiscal reflect the impact of a number of challenges faced during the year 
net sales of million decreased million  or compared to fiscal  primarily due to the impact of the cyclicality experienced in the pcb markets and the closure of our wood village  oregon factory in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in sales volumes affected factory utilization rates and as a result gross margin decreased from of net sales in fiscal to in fiscal operating expenses  exclusive of severance and impairment charges  have decreased by million  or 
we have taken steps to restructure our business  including the closure of our hong kong and wood village  oregon facilities as well as made significant investments in our huiyang  china facility and a global erp system 
in addition  we have streamlined many of our administrative processes resulting in the previously mentioned operating expense reductions 
we believe that these and other 
table of contents actions  assuming improved markets  will enable us to return to profitability on a quarterly basis in fiscal net sales net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased million  or in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net sales in fiscal were negatively affected by cyclicality in the north american pcb industry 
the north american pcb industry is highly cyclical and has cycles that generally last between and months 
further  the variations between peak and trough demand often fluctuate by to  thus causing revenues to vary significantly depending on the market cycle 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal primarily reflected changes in the macro business cycles and  to a lesser extent  the impacts related to the closure of our wood village facility 
during fiscal  market demand for pcbs was viewed by most industry analysts as being at or near the top of the last business cycle 
in contrast  the fiscal overall pcb demand was much lower  particularly for north american produced products 
our oregon and san jose segments were affected most by the decrease in demand for north american full lead time production 
partially offsetting the decrease in demand in north american production was an increase at our asia segment  as described in more detail below 
during fiscal  we acquired merix asia on september  the timing of the acquisition  combined with the one month lag in accounting for this segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  means that these operations were only included in fiscal for weeks  whereas in fiscal and fiscal  the results of merix asia s operations were included in our results of operations for the entire year 
this is the primary reason for the variation in revenue  cost of sales  gross profit and operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal revenues also reflected improvements in unit sales and pricing at certain segments as detailed below  as well as increases in quick turn and premium service revenues as compared to fiscal quick turn and premium revenues include revenues from products that sell at a premium over our standard base price as a result of rapid prototype manufacturing or the request by our customers to compress lead time for higher volume orders 
segment information net sales by segment were as follows in thousands merix oregon merix san jose merix asia 
table of contents per unit information selected statistical information is summarized below 
we define unit as the number of panels 
percentage increases decreases in unit volume and pricing were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal merix oregon unit volume average unit pricing merix san jose unit volume average unit pricing merix asia unit volume average unit pricing overall unit volume average unit pricing merix oregon the decrease in unit volume at merix oregon in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower north american demand caused by the cyclicality that is inherent in the pcb industry 
in addition  net sales in fiscal were reduced due to lower capacity resulting from the closure of our wood village facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal to a lesser extent  unit volume declined in fiscal due to north american production transitioning to either merix asia or to other lower cost offshore competitors 
the decrease in average unit pricing in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a number of factors including a decrease in the average panel layer count as well as a decrease in the volume of quick turn and premium services revenue that typically carries a higher market price when compared to full lead time 
the reduction in compressed lead time volume is accelerated in the softer periods of market cyclicality along with oregon factory constraints in the latter half of the fiscal year resulting from the temporary capacity restraints coming from the wood village closure 
the decrease in unit volume at merix oregon in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the effect in the second half of fiscal of the cyclicality that is inherent in the pcb industry 
merix san jose unit volumes at merix san jose decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to market cyclicality 
the effect of the market downturn was partially offset by an increase in average unit pricing 
the increase in average unit pricing was due primarily to our efforts to grow the volume of less than day lead time products  which inherently carry a higher price premium compared to longer lead time work 
we intend to continue to shorten average san jose lead times to drive increased panel prices 
unit volume at merix san jose decreased while average pricing increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase in higher technology high density interconnect hdi panel shipments  which garner higher pricing and utilize higher capacity when compared to standard panels 
merix asia the increase in net sales at merix asia in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the average unit price 
average unit prices increased primarily as a result of targeted growth in sales of higher priced  higher technology  higher layer count panels that were enabled by successfully increasing the technological capabilities of our asia factories and the increased awareness 
table of contents of our customer base about our manufacturing capabilities 
to a lesser extent  price increases on certain legacy products to improve the overall profitability of the book of business also increased our average unit pricing 
unit volume decreased as growth in sales of the higher technology parts were offset by targeted decreases of lower layer count parts 
this strategy reduced panel shipments while increasing the average layer count  resulting in higher value  higher profit parts shipments 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  we closed our outer layer portion of the hong kong facility and shifted that work to our china facilities 
we did not lose any significant business as a result of this closure 
the full closure of the hong kong factory occurred on march  the improvement in unit volume in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that we only had weeks of activity reported in fiscal compared to a full year in fiscal see also the discussion regarding discontinued operations below 
the increase in unit volume was partially offset by management s decision during the last three quarters of fiscal to disengage from unprofitable products  primarily related to higher laminate costs  or products that it believed would not reach acceptable profitability in a reasonable period of time 
the orders existing at the time of purchasing merix asia were heavily weighted to the automotive industry and computing and peripherals market  which are generally lower technology and or lower margin businesses 
we purposely began shifting the merix asia order mix to higher technology  higher gross margin customers  which contributed to the increase in average unit pricing in asia in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in the second half of fiscal  we were able to increase prices for a portion of our book of business to help absorb a portion of the increased copper laminate costs  which occurred primarily in the first two quarters of fiscal net sales by end market the following table shows  for the periods indicated  the amount of net sales to each of our principal end user markets and their percentage of our consolidated net sales dollars in thousands communications networking automotive computing peripherals test  industrial and medical defense aerospace other the million or decrease in communications networking in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the cyclicality of the north american market discussed above  the ultimate demand for our customers products  lower average selling prices  as well as the loss of certain north american business to asian competitors 
our business plans anticipate regaining some of the lost business once our china factories increase their capacity and capabilities  which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal the million or increase in automotive in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to management s fiscal decision to disengage from certain unprofitable automotive programs and parts that reduced revenue in fiscal these unprofitable programs have since been replaced by additional automotive revenue that is more profitable 
the million or decrease in computing peripherals during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to similar factors as discussed for the decrease in communications networking  but were also negatively affected by management s fiscal decision to disengage from certain unprofitable 
table of contents business that was being produced by merix asia  coupled with a temporary sharp increase in demand from one customer in the first half of fiscal that has not since been repeated 
the increases in test  industrial medical and defense aerospace of million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal were due primarily to our deliberate efforts to penetrate these markets both to diversify our customer base and grow revenue  as well as overall market growth in the defense aerospace segment 
the million or decrease in net sales to other end markets in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the cyclicality of the pcb market 
the growth in the automotive  computing peripherals and other markets in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from the addition of merix asia on september  we also targeted the higher technology defense aerospace markets as a platform for merix north america s growth  which contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal communications networking net sales in fiscal grew by compared to fiscal as fiscal represented a peak in the demand cycle for pcbs 
net sales to that market decreased as a percentage of total net sales due to the diversification of our markets and customers that resulted from the merix asia acquisition in fiscal net sales by geographic region in fiscal  and  net sales to customers outside the united states totaled  and of net sales  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead 
a number of costs  including those for labor  utilities and manufacturing supplies  incurred by our plants in china are denominated in chinese renminbi 
strengthening or weakening of the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar affects our cost of sales and profitability 
recent increases in the value of the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar have caused the costs of our chinese operations to increase as stated in us dollars 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit by segment was as follows in thousands merix oregon merix san jose merix asia our gross margin as a percentage of net sales by segment was as follows merix oregon merix san jose merix asia overall 
table of contents merix oregon our gross margin both in whole dollars and as a percentage of net sales at merix oregon decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower demand and pricing referenced earlier 
these factors affected the factory utilization rates which  along with lower average selling prices  contributed to the decrease in gross profit 
factory margins are heavily influenced by factory utilization rates because the cost structure needed to produce pcbs is heavily weighted to fixed or step variable costs 
thus  lower demand resulted in lower utilization rates and decreases in gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
our fixed cost levels were somewhat mitigated within the year as a result of our fourth quarter closure of our wood village  oregon inner layer production facility which reduced our fixed costs base by approximately million on an annualized basis 
the increase in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales for merix oregon compared to fiscal primarily related to improved market demand and increased unit prices  as well as a shift in mix to sales of more profitable products as discussed above 
we also increased our mix of hdi products  which are more difficult to manufacture and command higher prices than our more traditional pcb business 
these increases were partially offset by increases in raw material prices  primarily copper laminate 
the effect on merix oregon due to the increases in copper laminate prices was not as significant as it was for merix asia as copper laminate is a smaller percentage of the overall product cost at merix oregon than at merix asia 
in addition  merix oregon was more successful in the passing along of the increases in copper costs through higher unit pricing 
merix san jose our gross margins at merix san jose decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to lower demand impacting the factory utilization rates 
the downturn in the business cycle discussed above also negatively affected both selling prices and gross margins at merix san jose in fiscal additionally  labor costs increased by million due to primarily to labor rate increases associated with adjustments to compensation and benefit levels in north america to align with local markets 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales at merix san jose in fiscal compared to fiscal was consistent with the reasons discussed for merix oregon above 
merix asia our gross margin at merix asia increased primarily as a result of improvements in the product mix  as well as better factory utilization rates at the china based facilities 
in addition  we have been able to adjust our unit pricing in fiscal to reflect the increased copper pricing  which occurred during the first half of fiscal one of the primary strategies in acquiring merix asia was to eliminate lower margin and unprofitable business while growing higher margin  higher technology business in asia that was enabled by merix north america business and manufacturing process knowledge 
this new business has been termed synergy business 
synergy business as a percentage of total merix asia sales increased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal synergy business represents sales of products that were not sold by merix asia prior to our acquisition and that are enabled by our north america sales force 
we anticipate that synergy business will continue to grow as a percentage of merix asia s total net sales  even with the closure of our hong kong facility 
we estimate that approximately of the synergy revenue was from products previously manufactured at our oregon factories  with the remainder being incremental business from new or existing north american customers 
we also gained efficiencies in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the closing of the outer layer portion of our hong kong facility and the transfer of that work to our china facilities that will have a more significant impact on our fiscal results 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for merix asia in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to higher raw material costs  principally copper laminate  which was affected by a sharp rise in copper prices 
merix asia also incurred increased outsourcing costs in fiscal in order to meet demand from its growing revenue base 

table of contents engineering costs engineering costs include indirect labor  materials and overhead to support customer design and the development of new manufacturing processes required to meet our customers technology requirements  as well as to support our current manufacturing processes 
engineering costs increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in headcount as we refilled positions that were left open from turnover in previous periods 
additionally  as fiscal consisted of weeks  the results include an additional week of expense 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to having a full year of activity at merix asia in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative sg a costs include indirect labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the combination of restructuring efforts completed during fiscal and our planned focus on consolidation and centralization of shared functional services across our segments 
we also undertook a realignment of our arrangements with outside sales representatives  which decreased our commission expense in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily related to the addition of merix asia  increased salaries and related costs due to an increase in corporate headcount to support global operations  a million signing bonus for our new ceo and increased share based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  fiscal included increased sarbanes oxley sox compliance fees due to the initial implementation of sox in merix asia and increased legal fees related to securities litigation 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the million decrease in both fiscal and fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily because merix san jose customer intangibles were fully amortized midway through fiscal our identifiable intangible assets balance at may  was million and current amortization is approximately million per quarter 

table of contents severance  impairment and restructuring charges total severance  impairment and restructuring charges were as follows in thousands merix oregon impairment charges fixed assets and other merix oregon severance charges merix asia impairment charges fixed assets and other merix asia impairment charges goodwill merix asia severance charges merix san jose impairment charges goodwill ceo and other executive severance and related costs fiscal charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the closure of our hong kong facility in a restructuring action undertaken to consolidate our asian operations at our lower cost facilities in china 
in connection with this restructuring action  we recorded approximately million in asset impairment charges and million in severance and related costs  excluding amounts to be paid out to certain employees employed under a continuous contract for not less than five years the long service payment plan 
additionally  we incurred severance costs totaling million due to other restructuring actions at merix asia in fiscal we paid approximately million in severance and related costs by the end of fiscal remaining severance costs totaling million are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at may  and are expected to be paid in the first half of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also completed the closure of our manufacturing facility located in wood village  oregon under a plan to transition production from the wood village facility to our manufacturing facilities located in forest grove  oregon and huiyang  china 
overall oregon inner layer production capacity was reduced by approximately and panel capacity was reduced by approximately 
the decision to close the facility was brought about by a number of factors including continued migration of traditional merix business to merix asia as well as other asian based competitors  and continued erosion of merix north american gross margins over the past two fiscal years  believed to result in part from the cyclicality of the pcb industry 
the closure of the facility and other restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately positions 
we recorded approximately million in restructuring charges related to the closure of the of the wood village facility  as well as other restructuring actions  comprising million in asset impairments and other costs  including lease termination costs and adjustments to the asset retirement obligation accrual for the wood village lease  and million related to severance 
in april  we entered into an agreement to sublease the facility commencing in the first quarter of fiscal except for the million asset retirement obligation included as a component of other current liabilities  all other cash expenses related to this restructuring have been paid 
with the sublease in place  we do not expect to incur material charges in future quarters related to the closure of this facility 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we terminated our executive vice president of global operations 
in accordance with the executive employment agreement related to this termination  we recorded million of severance and related costs which were paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to continuing and forecasted future operating losses  we performed an impairment analysis pursuant to sfas no 
we primarily utilized market value analyses to determine the fair value of the assets 
pursuant to this analysis  we recorded a million impairment charge of which million related primarily to the property  plant and equipment and land use rights for our hong kong facility 

table of contents based on our fiscal review of the fair value of our merix san jose and merix asia operating segment net assets and their related book value  charges totaling million for goodwill impairment were recorded as indicated in the above table 
in estimating the fair value of the operating segments net assets  we utilized a present value of cash flow projections methodology 
the declines in the estimated fair values of the operating segments resulted from lower historical operating results than previously anticipated and lower future estimated cash flows 
ceo and other executive severance and related costs totaling million in fiscal comprised the following a lump sum cash payment of million and non cash share based compensation of million related to the issuance of share based awards upon the resignation of our former chief executive officer  million for fees related to recruiting a new chief executive officer  million of cash severance related to the resignation of merix asia s chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million of cash severance related to the termination of a merix asia senior manager 
fiscal charges during the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented cost reduction actions that included the elimination of approximately employee positions across our company s manufacturing and support organizations  predominantly in oregon 
we recorded a charge of million related to severance costs and million for the impairment of certain fixed assets 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income interest income decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances due to cash used for the expansion of our facility in huiyang  china and  to a lesser extent  the impact of the decrease in market interest rates in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the reduction in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower average cash and investment balances due to cash used for the acquisition of merix asia in september  as well as cash used for the repayment of million of principal on our outstanding debt in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the repayment of million of debt in the first three quarters of fiscal  as well as a million reduction in our million subordinated promissory note in connection with the reduction in the purchase price of merix asia in the second quarter of fiscal also  in the third quarter of fiscal  we repaid million on the subordinated promissory note and the remaining million of outstanding principal was eliminated in exchange for us settling all past and any future claims against the note holder in relation to our merix asia acquisition 

table of contents the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower overall borrowing costs resulting from the refinancing of a portion of the merix asia acquisition debt with the lower cost convertible bond offering in may borrowing levels were also reduced in part by cash generated from operations  which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings 
interest expense in fiscal also included the reversal of million of previously accrued interest due to a reduction in the principal amount of our subordinated promissory note from million to million upon the reduction in the purchase price of merix asia  which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal debt extinguishment costs debt extinguishment costs of million in fiscal related to the replacement of our million revolving line of credit facility 
debt extinguishment costs of million in fiscal related to the early redemption of our million  convertible debenture due may  the prepayment of our million asia term loan and the prepayment of our million asia revolving loan 
gain on settlement of debt under the terms of the subordinated note payable related to the merix asia acquisition  a principal payment of approximately million would ordinarily have been due december  however  we exercised our rights under the subordinated note not to make this payment due to merix claims against the seller 
on january   we settled these claims and made a payment of million to settle all remaining obligations under the subordinated promissory note 
the remaining balance of million outstanding on the subordinated note payable was eliminated in exchange for us releasing the seller from all past and any future claims relating to the merix asia acquisition 
we do not expect any of the other settlement terms to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
other income expense  net net other expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to increased loss on foreign currency transactions related to the devaluation of the us dollar compared to the chinese renminbi 
net other expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the recording of several miscellaneous income items in asia in fiscal income tax expense our provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profit and loss earned in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our provision for income taxes based on our projected consolidated results of operations for the full year and we record an adjustment during the current quarter accordingly 
in fiscal  and  our effective income tax rate was  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal differs from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of our mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions  the diversity in income tax rates  interest accrued on the potential liability for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fin  and our continuous assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate reflects current taxes expected to be paid in profitable jurisdictions and maintenance of valuation allowances in jurisdictions with cumulative losses or profitability risks 
in fiscal  we reversed a net million of valuation allowance against certain merix asia deferred tax assets 
this reversal is reflected on our financial statements as a million increase in deferred tax assets  a million decrease to goodwill and a million decrease to tax expense 
in addition  we recorded million in potential liability for uncertain tax positions related to the adoption of fin this is reflected as a million increase to goodwill  a million charge to beginning accumulated deficit  and a million increase to income tax expense 

table of contents our effective income tax rate in fiscal differed from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to various nondeductible charges relating to foreign activities  specifically the impairment of goodwill  certain interest and intercompany transactions and tax losses incurred by some foreign entities for which no benefit has been realized due to increasing the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal differed from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of our mix of profit and loss earned in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
we indefinitely reinvest the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we will provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent foreign subsidiaries have positive taxable earnings and they are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us at may   the cumulative earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries was a taxable deficit and there were no dividends from foreign subsidiaries during fiscal accordingly  no us income tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries was provided 
china passed a unified enterprise income tax law in march the new law took effect on january  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the newly enacted rates were applied to the existing deferred tax balance and the related valuation allowance 
as a result  the deferred tax balance increased by million with an offsetting increase in the valuation allowance 
discontinued operations on september   merix holding hong kong limited merix hong kong entered into an agreement with citi power investment limited citi power to sell merix hong kong s shareholding interest in the lomber single sided manufacturing facility located in huizhou city in the prc the lomber facility for a nominal amount

in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we recorded the related assets and liabilities as current assets and liabilities on our balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  upon being classified as discontinued operations 
the combined net book value of the dongguan and lomber facilities was approximately million upon their classification as discontinued operations and their fair value  less selling costs  was determined to be approximately  accordingly  during the quarter ended november   we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a component of loss from discontinued operations and a reversal of a portion of this impairment charge of  and  respectively  were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal upon final disposition of the dongguan and lomber facilities 
the sale was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the results of operations for the dongguan and lomber facilities have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
certain financial information related to discontinued operations was as follows in thousands revenue net impairment related to assets of discontinued operations pre tax loss 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of may  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving bank credit agreement  described below 
we expect our capital resources to be sufficient to fund our operations and known capital requirements for at least one year from may   although we may seek additional sources of funds 
we have a loan and security agreement with bank of america  na the credit agreement which provides a revolving line of credit of up to million based on a borrowing base calculated with respect to the value of accounts receivable  equipment  and real property 
the credit agreement expires in february the obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our us assets 
the borrowings bear interest based  at the company s election  on either the prime rate announced by bank of america or libor plus an applicable margin 
as of may   no amounts were outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement contains usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  all of which we were in compliance with as of may  in fiscal  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million as of may  from million as of may  primarily as a result of the use of million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and the use of million for the repayment of long term borrowings and capital leases  offset by million provided by operations as described in more detail below 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million 
cash totaling million was provided by net loss of million  adjusted for million in non cash charges  primarily million for depreciation and amortization and million for impairment and non cash restructuring charges 
as discussed in more detail below  other significant changes in working capital generating million in cash from operations in fiscal include million from reductions in accounts receivable and million from net increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by consumption of million in cash for an increase in other assets 
note that changes in working capital balances vary from cash flows from operations due to the impact of non cash transactions on amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
accounts receivable  net of allowances for bad debts  decreased million to million as of may  from million as of may   due primarily to reduced net sales volumes 
our days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  was days at may  and days at may  prepaid and other current assets increased million to million as of may  compared to million as of may  this was primarily due to a million increase in prepaid value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions due to the timing difference of receiving a tax refund from the prc local government for taxes paid to prc local vendors for the purchase of materials 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected a net increase of million to million as of may  compared to million as of may  this was primarily due to increased focus on improving the management of working capital  including an effort to purchase products and services on more favorable payment terms from our vendors 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal primarily consisted of expenditures for the expansion and improvement of the process technology at our china based facilities  improvement of the process technology and increasing the process speed of our north american facility and the continuing implementation of a company wide erp system 
planned capital expenditures in fiscal are approximately to million 
additional capital expenditures may be approved in fiscal  but are dependent upon achievement of financial objectives 
a significant portion of this spending is related to a project for expanding both the capacity and the technological capabilities of our huiyang  china based factory 
we anticipate that this investment will allow us to expand margins and profitably

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
it is reasonable possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
significant accounting policies and estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of excess and obsolete inventories and idle facilities  the valuation and impairment of long lived assets  the valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation  warranty liabilities  legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no further customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
provisions for estimated sales returns and adjustments are made at the point of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
sales adjustments are charged against consolidated net sales 
consignment sales are recognized at the time the consignee uses the consignment goods and all criteria of revenue recognition described above have been satisfied by the consignee 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of the accounts receivable balance and we maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical bad debt experience  ongoing credit evaluations of customers and changes in our customers businesses 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify uncollectible receivables  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventories and idle facilities provisions for inventories are made to reduce excess inventories to their estimated net realizable values  as necessary 
a change in customer demand for inventory is the primary indicator for reductions in inventory carrying values 
we record inventory provisions based on historical experiences with customers  the ability to utilize inventory in other programs  the ability to redistribute inventory back to the suppliers and current and forecasted demand for the inventory 
on may   we adopted sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we are required to estimate the amount of idle capacity and allocate and expense amounts in the current period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expensed million related to abnormally low production volumes 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be our primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify indicators of impairment and to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 

table of contents see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges to long lived assets in fiscal  and valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  they are measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by sfas no 
 in our impairment test of goodwill  we compare the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting entity exceeds the estimate of fair value  we record an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its estimated fair value 
in the impairment tests for other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over the estimate of fair value 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding goodwill impairment charges in fiscal intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 as discussed above 
share based compensation on may   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
under this method  the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption over the remainder of the requisite service period 
our deferred share based compensation balance of million as of may   which was accounted for under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  was reclassified to common stock upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards  which requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
therefore  we have reduced the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures 
forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns 
we update our forfeiture estimates as warranted and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our share based compensation 

table of contents warranty liabilities we generally warrant our products for a period of up to twelve months from the time of sale 
however  in selected circumstances  merix asia grants longer warranty periods to certain customers of up to three years 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of the warranty upon transfer of ownership of the products to the customer 
the warranty liability is calculated based on historical experience of expenses resulting from the warranty program for the twelve preceding months for merix oregon and merix san jose and for the preceding three year period for merix asia 
we also accrue warranty liability for certain specifically identified items that are not covered by our assessment of historical experience 
legal contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  all legal contingencies  which are judged to be both probable and estimable  are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on our best estimates of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claims 
we regularly monitor our estimates in light of current developments and changes in circumstances and we adjust our legal reserves accordingly 
if no particular amount is determined to constitute our best estimate of a particular legal contingency  a range of our estimate of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claim is disclosed and we will accrue for the low end of the range of costs  unless otherwise disclosed 
legal costs are expensed in the period in which they occur 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate legal contingency reserves 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in addition  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a transition adjustment of a million increase to goodwill  a million charge to beginning accumulated deficit and million increase to income tax expense in fiscal as of may   we had million in potential liability for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our funds available for investment and interest expense on our debt obligations 
we seek to mitigate our exposure by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk on our investment portfolio 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates would have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our domestic credit facility agreement  which bears interest based at our election on either the prime rate or libor  plus an additional margin based on our use of the credit facility 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility at may  foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international operations 
our primary foreign currency exposure stems from operating costs relating to manufacturing operations in the prc 
substantially all of our consolidated net sales are denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in derivative activities to hedge against foreign currency risk 
however  we regularly evaluate our risk management options 
net foreign currency transaction losses were million during fiscal and million during both fiscal and fair value of fixed rate debt the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise  however  the quoted market price of our debt is currently reflecting a significant risk premium 
at may   the book value of our fixed rate debt and the fair value based upon open market trades was as follows in thousands book value of fixed rate debt fair value of fixed rate debt
