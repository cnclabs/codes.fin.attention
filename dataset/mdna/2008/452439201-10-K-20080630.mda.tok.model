overview revenue sources

revenues derived from digital distribution of our exclusive content rights are beginning to grow 
net revenues generated by egami totaled   and  in fiscal  and  egami s first full year of operation  respectively 
revenues derived outside the us and canada are considered international and primarily represent proceeds from sublicenses with sony bmg  warner music and digital site from the distribution of our exclusive dvd content 
cost structure 
our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution and  less recently  the funding of content production or co production for exclusive distribution 
additionally  we incurred substantial legal  investment banking and other expenses during this fiscal year related to the final negotiations  related disputes and the eventual termination of the proposed merger agreement between us and btp acquisition company llc  as further set forth in item legal proceedings above 
acquisition of exclusive rights 
we are now acquiring primarily north american distribution rights to completed feature films while maintaining our core content rights acquisition focus on genres that have been successful in the past 
we continue to seek out early trend opportunities in advance of mainstream acceptance in an effort to keep acquisition costs lower by bringing titles to market before spikes in demand drive up acquisition costs  especially in growing genres such as urban and latin where we possess significant expertise 
we obtain our content from a variety of sources  including  but not limited to  content rights holders  producers  business management firms  law firms  talent agencies  independent film studios and record labels  the artists themselves and content finders 
agreements to acquire programming typically come in the form of an exclusive license agreement  where we either pay royalties or alternatively we receive distribution fees and pay net profits after recoupment of our upfront costs 
we generally base our offers of advances against future royalties or  for distribution agreements  advances against future net profit payments and in many cases production funding on the expected success of a title s performance at retail  actual cost of the production  and competition for the title s exclusive distribution rights

table of contents recent events maturation of dvd marketplace  resulting acceleration of amortization and fair value writedown of film costs at march  as noted in item business industry trends above  the dvd marketplace experienced the first noticeable year over year decline for the category since the format debuted in home media magazine reported in our fourth quarter that nielson videoscan scan showed a noticeable decline in dvd units actually sold through to consumers in image  with its catalog of more than  dvd titles and rights to hundreds of high definition masters which will be released in the new blu ray disc blu ray format  is primarily a non hits exclusive dvd distributor 
our sales of previously released catalogue titles continue to be negatively impacted by the maturation of the dvd marketplace and with it  declining shelf space dedicated to previously released programming 
we are extremely optimistic about our new release business  especially now that we are adding cast driven feature film distribution for the first time in fiscal as described in feature film division infrastructure additions fiscal expansion initiative below 
we are also optimistic that we can maintain and even grow revenues from our established brands like the criterion collection and discovery channel 
we are optimistic that we can grow our digital and worldwide broadcast revenues generated by our exclusive titles as well 
with retail shelf space continuing to decline and more space being allocated for major studio releases and now  the high definition format winner  blu ray  we are relying on growing sales to our internet retailers  with virtual shelf space and sophisticated search engines  to replace declining catalogue sales from our traditional brick and mortar retail customers 
we are additionally relying on growing digital revenues to replace declining catalogue sales as well 
while our revenues from internet retailers are growing  they are not yet replacing declining sales of catalogue programming to our brick and mortar retail customers 
while our digital revenues are growing extremely fast  they have not grown fast enough in terms of absolute dollar growth to replace declining catalogue sales to our brick and mortar customers 
given the immaturity of the digital industry  we cannot use significantly higher forecasts of our expected digital revenue growth to offset what we now see to be permanent declines in our packaged goods catalogue revenues 
shelf space allocated to cd titles continues to shrink as full album cd sales are negatively impacted by less expensive direct digital downloading on a song by song basis 
management believes it s prudent at this time  with the first time decline in dvd growth the marketplace maturation point as reported in our fiscal fourth quarter  the changing retail landscape and the continuing non temporary overall decline in image s catalogue revenues to more significantly adjust estimates of ultimate revenues by re evaluating the lifecycle of our dvd and cd content 
while we are optimistic regarding growth in revenues derived from blu ray distribution  we don t currently believe that the format will grow quickly enough to offset the decline experienced with revenues derived from older previously released titles 
sop requires that management re evaluate ultimate revenue projections on a periodic basis  which we have done for every past publicly reported period end 
such re evaluation has resulted in fair value writedowns of cd and dvd carrying costs as well as accelerated amortization and fair value writedown of other film costs  such as unrecouped advance royalties and distribution fees  production costs and music publishing 
these accelerated amortization and fair value writedowns have significantly contributed to image s losses over the last several years 
for fiscal  image recorded million in accelerated amortization and fair value writedown of its film costs  representing million in accelerated amortization and fair value writedowns of advance royalty and distribution fees and million in fair value writedowns of inventory 
of those amounts million and million were recorded in the fourth quarter  respectively 
for fiscal  image recorded  in accelerated amortization and fair value writedowns of advance royalty and distribution fees and  in fair value writedowns of inventories 
the sales lifecycle of a title  on average  follows a curve that begins at new release peak levels  followed by phases in which velocity diminishes  ultimately tailing off as the title approaches the end of its agreement term 
the decreases in velocity after the first year are significantly less than after initial release  resulting in what is often called the long tail of the entertainment lifecycle 
as the majority of image s catalogue of more than  dvd titles were released over a year ago  most fall into the category of catalogue or long tail product 
while we experience continuing tail sales  with shelf space becoming continually more constrained  we must reflect a much thinner tail 

table of contents accordingly  as a result of this re evaluation of ultimate revenues  image has recorded additional charges to cost of sales during the quarter ended march  of million  representing accelerated amortization and fair value writedown of its film costs  including inventories million and advance royalties and distribution fees million 
much of the adjustment was for deeper catalogue titles which inventory and unrecouped advance royalties and distribution fees were paid for in prior fiscal years 
termination of definitive agreement to sell image to btp  output distribution agreement with btp affiliate ct holdings  llc  and related disputes btp related expenses increased to million for fiscal the expenses consisted of legal  investment banking and other related expenses associated with the negotiations  related disputes and the eventual termination of the proposed merger agreement between us and btp

amendment to revolving credit facility 
at march   we had million borrowed under our revolving line of credit with wachovia 
in april  we amended our may three year loan and security agreement with wachovia to increase our maximum borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit to million  up from million and reduce minimum financial covenant levels on a going forward basis 
borrowings under the line are based upon our level of eligible accounts receivable 

table of contents the amendment increased interest on outstanding borrowings to either the prime rate plus up to up from prime plus up to or at our option the eurodollar rate plus up to up from eurodollar plus up to  subject to minimum borrowing levels 
the level of interest rate margin to prime or eurodollar is dependent upon our future financial performance as measured by ebitda  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the agreement 
actual borrowing availability is based on eligible trade accounts receivable levels 
in addition to increasing our borrowing availability  the amendment reduces the required minimum fixed charge coverage ratios on a going forward basis 
the measurement is for each three month period on or after march   
to september   
to december   to and each six month period on or after march   to june   to if we maintain minimum borrowing availability equal to  or greater than  million when the required fixed charge coverage ratio is less to and million when the required ratio is greater than  or equal to  to  this financial covenant will not be tested for compliance 
at march  we were not tested for covenant compliance because we had availability in excess of the required million minimum 
had we been tested  our negative ebitda  as defined  would have resulted in a fixed charge coverage ratio less than the required 
to accordingly  at march   our borrowing availability was million million availability based upon eligible accounts receivable less the million minimum requirement 
the wachovia agreement is subject to early termination fees  based upon the maximum facility amount of million  of if terminated within the end of the three year term 
the agreement also imposes restrictions on such items as encumbrances and liens  payment of dividends  other indebtedness  stock repurchases and capital expenditures and requires us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
any outstanding borrowings are secured by our assets 
private placement of senior convertible note and warrant 
on august   we issued to portside growth and opportunity fund portside  in a private placement  a senior convertible note in the principal amount of  and a related warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  and on november   we entered into an amendment and exchange agreement with portside  which agreement modified the transaction documents and provided for a replacement warrant to be issued in exchange for the warrant previously issued to portside 
the note accrues interest at a rate of per annum with accrued interest payable quarterly in arrears in either cash or stock 
the note has a term of five years and is convertible into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to antidilution adjustments 
the related warrant is exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to antidilution adjustments 
the warrant has a term of five years from the issuance date 
portside has a security interest in all of our assets in third position behind wachovia and arvato 
beginning in february  portside may require bi annual payments  each in the amount of  principal plus interest  subject to wachovia s approval based upon our then borrowing availability levels 
should the weighted average trading price of our common stock be greater than per share for the twenty trading days immediately prior to the due date for the first payment  then we could delay the first payment until august we have classified the potential february  principal payment as current in the accompanying balance sheet at march  
table of contents disc replication advance 
arvato exclusively manufactures our dvds and manufactures the majority of our cds 
on june   we received an interest free million advance against future dvd manufacturing from arvato  to be repaid at per dvd manufactured  plus payment of a administrative fee per dvd manufactured until the advance is repaid 
arvato has a security interest in all of our assets in second position behind wachovia 
as the obligation is non interest bearing  we initially imputed and recorded a debt discount of  to the million face amount of the advance based upon our then borrowing rate with our bank and recorded a deferred manufacturing credit  classified in other long term liabilities 
we are amortizing the debt discount  using the effective interest method  to interest expense 
at march   we have  remaining outstanding under the advance  exclusive of the debt discount

at march   we have accrued  of the fiscal licensing and exclusive distribution obligations above as the content suppliers have met their related contractual requirements 
as we have historically  we expect to fund these commitments through recoupment of existing advances  our existing bank line of credit  and other working capital 
now that we have closed our distribution facility and moved fulfillment over to arvato  we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including information technology related expenditures  to exceed million per year

off balance sheet arrangements 
we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
conclusion 
we believe that projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
see amendment to revolving credit facility above 
additionally  should we be in a position to acquire significantly higher profile content or libraries of content for exclusive distribution  or should we find an attractive  synergistic corporate acquisition  we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to fund the transaction 
we believe any such financing could come in the form of additional corporate debt  convertible debt  convertible preferred stock or straight equity issuance of our registered shares through a private investment in public equity investor  however  there are no assurances that such financing would be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant uncertainties  require judgments or estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  or that may produce materially different results when using different assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon meeting the recognition requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from home video distribution are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns  as well as related costs  in the period in which the product is available for sale by our customers at the point that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is generally upon receipt by the customer  and in the case of new releases  after street date restrictions lapse 
we recognize revenues from domestic and international broadcast licensing and home video sublicensing  as well as associated costs  when the titles are available to the licensee and other recognition requirements of sop are met 
we defer fees received in advance of availability  usually in the case of advances received from sony bmg  digital site  warner music group and other international home video sublicensees  and for broadcast  until other revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided at the time of sale 
as of march   deferred revenue totaled  up from  at march   primarily as a result of deferring revenues for titles with street dates subsequent to march  
table of contents royalty and distribution fees 
for each reporting period  we estimate the ultimate total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive distribution term from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while we charge royalty and distribution fee advances to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether we should record additional royalty and distribution fee expense as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
we amortize royalty and distribution fee advances to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  in circumstances required by sop  we recognize additional amortization to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
we base our estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title  similar titles and specific genre performance 
we attempt to reflect in our estimates the most current available information on the title 
we update such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s revenue performance 
estimates of ultimate revenues on a title by title basis are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting future actual performance include focus from the sales and marketing department including advertising  promotions and price reductions  availability of retail shelf space  retail customer product placement and advertising  maintenance of adequate inventory levels  concert touring by the artist in the case of music related dvds and cds  retail sell through  and ultimately continued end user consumer demand 
any of the above factors can contribute to a title s actual performance exceeding our expectations prior to release or failure to meet pre release expectations 
overestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized at a slower rate or a delay in adjusting costs to their fair value until such time estimates are reduced  causing unamortized costs to be overstated and increased amortization of costs in a later period 
underestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized more quickly until ultimate revenue estimates are increased  causing unamortized costs to be understated and decreased amortization of costs in a later period 
see 
maturation of dvd marketplace  resulting acceleration of amortization and fair value writedown of film costs at march  above under recent events 
inventory valuation 
for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title  format and genre  and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write down inventories that are considered obsolete or overstocked 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value  and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
future demand will be dependent upon the continued retail customer acceptance of our content  future demand by end user consumer  advertising  promotions and price reductions  market conditions either favorable or unfavorable and future warehouse storage limitations 
should projections of future inventory demand be overstated  the value of inventory would be overstated and current cost of sales understated  with future cost of sales overstated 
conversely  should projections of future demand be understated  the value of inventory would be understated and the current cost of sales overstated  with future cost of sales understated

table of contents allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable 
for each reporting period  we evaluate product sales and accounts receivable to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns  sales allowances and other credits given and delinquent accounts 
our estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected require the exercise of judgment and affect reported revenues and net earnings 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  we analyze historical returns quantity of returns and time to receive returned product  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  including reorder activity 
based on this information  we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product sales where the customer has the right to return such product and receive a credit memo 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
estimates of future sales returns and other credits are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting actual returns include retailer financial difficulties  the perception of comparatively poor retail performance in one or several retailer locations  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  inadequate advertising or promotions  retail prices being too high for the perceived quality of the content or other comparable content  the near term release of similar titles  and poor responses to package designs 
underestimation of product sales returns and other credits would result in an overstatement of current revenues and lower revenues in future periods 
conversely  overestimation of product sales returns would result in an understatement of current revenues and higher revenues in future periods 
similarly  we evaluate accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on this information  we reserve an amount that we believe to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions were to worsen  additional allowances might be required in the future 
underestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be overstated and current period expenses to be understated 
overestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be understated and current period expenses to be overstated 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
we have a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
even though we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carryforwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carryforward periods 
as of march   we had nol carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of  and  respectively  which are available to offset taxable income through and  respectively

revenues generated by digital distribution  though our wholly owned subsidiary egami  increased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal fiscal digital revenues increased from  for fiscal egami s first full year of operations  reflecting our participation in the dynamic growth of the digital distribution marketplace 
audio segment growth was driven by continued consumer adoption of downloading  especially of single tracks 
video segment growth is most directly attributed to video on demand rental retailer launches during the period 
electronic sell through growth for video was slower  but still encouraging 
international revenues 
our internationally generated revenues have significantly decreased over the last several years due to lower royalty revenues reported by our international sublicensees 
because of language barriers and cultural differences  much of our successful new release programming particularly urban and comedy titles has not been released internationally or has not sold as well as in north america 
we continue our efforts to acquire programming that sells well not only domestically  but also internationally 
music related dvds have done well internationally and we believe the urban music and documentary genres have revenue growth potential overseas

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations at march   approximately million of our outstanding borrowings were subject to changes in interest rates  however  we do not use derivatives to manage this risk 
this exposure is linked to the prime rate and libor 
management believes that moderate changes in the prime rate or libor would not materially impact our operating results or financial condition 
for example  a change in interest rates would result in an approximate  annual impact on pretax loss based upon our outstanding borrowings at march  management believes that moderate changes in the prime rate would not materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations at march   our accounts receivable related to international distribution and denominated in foreign currencies were minimal 
they are subject to future foreign exchange rate risk and could become significant in the future 
we distribute some of our licensed dvd programming for which we hold international distribution rights internationally through sublicensees 
additionally  we exploit international broadcast rights to some of our exclusive entertainment programming for which we hold international broadcast rights 
management believes that moderate changes in foreign exchange rates will not materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
to date  we have not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts
