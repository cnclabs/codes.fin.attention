table of contents overview we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world 
each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity 
we manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated  proprietary  continuous process 
in and  we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany 
currently  we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg  ohio and frankfurt oder  germany manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our perrysburg  ohio manufacturing facility 
we completed the qualification of the first production line at our perrysburg  ohio plant for high volume production in november during  the first full year this production line operated at high volume production  we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to  from in our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to in and to in  when we had both plants operating at high volume production 
we define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period divided by the total watts produced during the period 
by continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt 
our objective is to become  by  the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that generates electricity on a non subsidized basis at a price equal to the price of retail electricity in key markets in north america  europe and asia 
first solar was founded in to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research  development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in january from january to the end of  we sold approximately mw of solar modules 
during and  we sold approximately mw and mw of solar modules  respectively 
on february   we were incorporated as a delaware corporation 
prior to that date  we operated as a delaware limited liability company 
on november   we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc  a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and fortune companies in the united states 
starting in december  we operate this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of first solar electric  llc 
we believe the acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc will enable us to develop solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements 
the total consideration for the transaction was million excluding exit and transaction costs of million  consisting of million in common stock and million in cash see note 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   and all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december  we use a week fiscal quarter 
manufacturing capacity we commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in perrysburg  ohio in january during and  while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line  we designed and built our first replicable  high throughput production line at the ohio plant 
we ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into this first production line  completing its qualification for full volume production in november in february  we commenced construction of two additional production lines at our ohio plant 
we completed the qualification of these two additional production lines for full volume production in august during the construction of these two production lines  we improved certain aspects of our first production line  including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment 
our two line ohio expansion represents a standard building block 
table of contents for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities 
our ohio plant currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of mw based on the fourth quarter of average run rate 
in february  we commenced construction of our german plant  a new manufacturing facility located in frankfurt oder in the state of brandenburg that houses four production lines 
we completed the qualification of these four additional production lines for full volume production in the third quarter of in addition  on january  we entered into a land lease agreement for a manufacturing center site in the kulim hi tech park in the state of kadah  malaysia 
the malaysia site can accommodate two four line plants 
on november   we exercised an option to lease an adjacent land site that can accommodate an additional two four line plants 
as of december   we do not have any more options to lease more land in malaysia 
in april  we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we began construction of plants two and three  respectively  and in the first quarter of  we began construction of plant four 
we expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of  plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of  and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second half of after plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity  we will have production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately mw based on the fourth quarter of run rate at our existing plants 
the following table summarizes our current and in process production capacity annual production date qualification number of capacity of completed for production manufacturing full volume manufacturing facility lines facility production ohio plant mw august german plant mw third quarter of malaysia plant i mw second half of malaysia plant ii mw first half of malaysia plant iii mw second half of malaysia plant iv mw second half of total current and planned mw we completed the qualification for full volume production of the first production line at our ohio plant in november and the second and third production lines in august we completed the qualification for full volume production of all four production lines at our german plant in the third quarter of anticipated date for full volume production 
based on the fourth quarter of run rate at our existing plants 
financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
net sales we generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules 
over the past four years  the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce 
we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power 
for example  during our average sales price was per watt based on a weighted annual average foreign exchange of 
as a result  our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts 
we currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany  france and spain  which then resell our solar modules to end users who receive government subsidies 
the majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currency and subject to the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

table of contents for example  the strengthening of the euro contributed million to our net sales during fiscal compared to fiscal our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in europe  north america or asia or if interest rates increase  which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects 
in april  we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european project developers and system integrators  and in  we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects collectively  the long term supply contracts 
these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from through and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance 
our long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately billion billion at an assumed exchange rate of in sales from to for the sale of a total of gw of solar modules 
our long term supply contracts entered into in require us to deliver solar modules each year that  in total  meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year 
under these long term supply contracts  we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately annually from to and then by for modules delivered in if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year  we will be in breach of the applicable agreements  entitling our customers to certain remedies  potentially including the right to terminate their long term supply contracts 
our long term supply contracts entered into in do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases annually from to  and then remains fixed through  and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module 
all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in because the sales prices under our long term supply contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year  we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers 
although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term supply contracts  our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin 
the annual decline in the sales price under the long term supply contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately each year  assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat  and will impact our cash flow accordingly 
as a result  our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease 
furthermore  the sales prices under the long term supply contracts are denominated in euros  exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
under our customer contracts  starting in april  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
under our customer contracts in effect prior to april   we did not transfer title or risk of loss  or recognize revenue  until the solar modules were received by our customers 
our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 
under our long term supply contracts we have the right to terminate certain long term supply contracts upon months notice  and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred  including  depending on the contract one or more of the following new laws  rules or regulations with respect to our production  distribution  installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business  unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread  persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels  or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor  materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput 
the average termination fee under those agreements is million million at an assumed exchange rate of 
our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume 
these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the long term supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers 
in the 
table of contents case of a late delivery  certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue 
if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments  our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 
the information about our long term supply contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the long term supply contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results  including revenues or profitability 
with our acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc on november   a small portion of our revenues have been accounted for using the percent of completion method of accounting 
revenues for first solar electric  llc for fiscal december were million and not material to our consolidated results of operations 
no single customer accounted for more than of our net sales in cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components  such as tempered back glass  tco coated front glass  cadmium telluride  laminate  connector assemblies and laminate edge seal and others 
our total material cost per solar module has been stable over the past three years  even though the cost of tellurium  a component of cadmium telluride  increased by approximately three times from to the increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs 
historically  we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials 
starting in  however  we entered into multi year tellurium and cadtel supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies 
we expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase 
other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety  quality and production control and procurement 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue warranty and end of life collection and recycling expenses to our cost of sales 
we implemented a program in to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use 
under our collection and recycling program  we enter into an agreement with the end users of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules 
in the agreement  we commit  at our expense  to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials 
in return  the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our collection and recycling program or another program that we approve  and the photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide 
at the time we sell a solar module  we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation 
we record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling  general and administrative expense 
overall  we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per line  geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities 
for example  our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines approximately at the beginning of each year 
another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached 
as a result  gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 

table of contents research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products  materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities 
we continuously add equipment for further process developments and record the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense 
we may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the ohio expansion to research and development expense 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes 
we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy  brookhaven national laboratory and several universities 
we report our research and development expense net of grant funding 
during the past three years  we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs 
we received million during each of the fiscal years and and million during we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity 
over time  we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
deferred project costs deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials relating to customer contracts 
these costs are recognized as deferred assets until installed 
deferred project costs as of december  were million 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expense and other selling expenses 
we expect these expenses to increase in the near term  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company 
over time  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we incurred production start up expenses of million during fiscal year in connection with the qualification of the ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the german plant 
we incurred production start up expenses of million during in connection with the qualification of the german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center 
we expect to incur significant production start up expenses in fiscal year in connection with our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center 
in general  we expect production start up expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
over time  we expect production start up expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 

table of contents interest expense interest expense is incurred on various debt financings 
see description of certain indebtedness 
foreign currency gain loss foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  the us dollar 
income taxes we were incorporated as a delaware corporation on february  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
prior to february   we operated as a delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes 
as a result  the annual historical financial data included in this annual report on form k does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been  had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year 
at december  we had us federal  state  and us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our ability to use these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws 
certain of our non us subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions 
we expect the tax consequences of our non us subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our non us production capacity 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill  property  plant and equipment  economic development funding and share based compensation 
during the year ended december   we reversed valuation allowances in the amount of million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million before valuation allowances  consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill  property  plant and equipment  economic development funding and share based compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results 
we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience  on our forecasts and on other available information  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting policies and estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are as follows revenue recognition 
we sell our products directly to system integrators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
this policy is in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revision of topic revenue recognition 
under this policy  we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce 
table of contents inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts 
during  we changed the terms of our sales contracts with all of our significant customers to provide that delivery occurs when we deliver our products to the carrier  rather than when the products are received by our customer  as had been our terms under our prior contracts 
this change in the terms of our sales contracts resulted in a one time increase to our net sales of million during the year ended december  we do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products 
with our acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc on november   a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
accordingly  we will record long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
if we identify any losses on contracts  we will recognize those losses immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
furthermore  contract change orders  claims and similar items  require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
we only include contract change orders  claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable 
incurred costs include all direct material  labor  subcontractor cost  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
we include job material costs when the job materials have been installed 
where contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design 
as of december   our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  which is part of the balance sheet caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities  was million 
this liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts  which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies 
we also have a limited number of arrangements that include multiple deliverables 
these are contracts under which we both provide design and consulting services for and supply parts and equipment for solar electricity generation systems 
we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when accounting for these arrangements in order to determine whether they have more than one unit of accounting 
according to eitf  deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer  if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available  and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items 
we determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting  the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar electricity generation system parts and equipment 
we apply the same revenue recognition principles from sab as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements 
we recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop end of life collection and recycling 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives 
we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module s installation site to a recycling center and the material  labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk rate for such services 
we based this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled 
in the periods between the time of 
table of contents our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement 
we charged million and million to cost of sales for the fair value of our collection and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the fiscal year ended december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december  the accretion expense on our collection and recycling obligations was insignificant  and during the year ended december  the accretion expense was million 
an increase of or a decrease of in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling each solar module would result in a increase or decrease  respectively  in our annual collection and recycling cost accrual  a increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a decrease in our estimated costs  and a decrease in the rate would result in a increase in the cost 
product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions 
we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their initial power output rating within the first years following their installation and at least of their initial power output rating within the following years 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser 
we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales  using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing 
during the fiscal year ended december   we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty 
during the fiscal years ended december  and december   this estimate did not require further significant adjustments 
share based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards  and we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended december  using the modified retrospective method of transition 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the implementation of sfas r 
in particular  sab provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models  the classification of share based compensation expense  the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis in filings with the sec 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options  which is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes merton formula  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
because our stock has only recently become publicly traded  we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility  therefore  we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price 
we estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards  even if the critical terms of the awards are similar 
higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest 
quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation 
increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters 
decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the 
table of contents quarter of the change and future quarters 
these adjustments affect our cost of sales  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative and production start up expenses 
the adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest reduced our share based compensation expense by million in the fiscal year ended december  and increased our share based compensation expense by million in the fiscal year ended december  adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year 
the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities 
our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules 
we account for our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  we assess long lived assets classified as held and used including our property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms 
as a result  we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of us and us tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases  including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations 
determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events  including the following the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law  and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions  or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets  liabilities  expenses and benefits that we record during any given period 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the future periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 
we determine the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which require us to weigh both positive and negative evidence in order to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence  including the existence of cumulative net losses  benefits that could be realized from available tax strategies and forecasts of future taxable income  in determining the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
certain effects of the acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc 
the turner renewable energy  llc tre acquisition is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  tre s results of operations and the impact of the completion of the acquisition will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis 
fiscal december financial results for first solar electric  llc formerly turner renewable energy  llc were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and  if necessary  would record any impairment in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we will perform the first annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal or earlier if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
in the process of our annual 
table of contents impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our goodwill 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
marketable securities 
we have classified our marketable securities as available for sale 
such marketable securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized 
realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings  computed using the specific identification cost method 
all of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we consider our marketable debt securities impaired  when a significant decline in the issuer s credit quality is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as being impaired are subject to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established

as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  one of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines  such as the recently completed german plant and the plants currently under construction at our malaysia manufacturing center 
we expect that each four line manufacturing plant that we are building in malaysia will require a capital expenditure of approximately million to complete 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flows from operating activities  government grants and low interest debt financings for our german plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next months 
however  if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions  we may not have sufficient resources to support our expansion strategy 
we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future  which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms  we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy 
see item a risk factors our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner  both of which are subject risks and uncertainties 
we spent million in capital expenditures for the ohio expansion through in addition  we spent approximately million for the build out of our german plant through we expect to spend approximately million to build each of the four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center 
we spent million toward the build out of each of these plants at our malaysian manufacturing center in and we expect to spend approximately million in and an additional million in a majority of our capital expenditures for and will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements filed with this annual report on form k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk our international operations accounted for approximately of our net sales in and of our net sales in  all of which were denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate  affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses 
historically  most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts 
for example  our long term supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
in  a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by million 
with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and the current expansion into malaysia  our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  cash flow and translation transaction exposure we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 

table of contents as of december   we had a single outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contract with a notional value equivalent to million million at a fixed exchange rate of  maturing in february  to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure 
cash flow exposure we have forecasted future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments 
changes in the relevant entity s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified this into earnings when the transaction is settled 
the notional amount of our cash flow hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment was million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of and the losses  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  were million 
earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income  net 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our end users depend on debt financing to purchase and install a solar electricity generation system 
although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately years  end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation 
as a result  many of our end users rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure and final project 
an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system on favorable terms  or at all  and thus lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar electricity generation systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar electricity generation systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
during july  we entered into the ikb credit facility  which bears interest at euribor plus for the term loan  euribor plus for the bridge loan and euribor plus for the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we hedged our exposure to changes in euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 
in addition  we invest some of our cash in debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of three months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by
