we do not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources  including known trends and uncertainties identified by management  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
in  we reclassified our geographical net sales and segment reporting to reflect changes in our internal management and oversight structure as well as growth of the international distributor business 
net sales to international distributors  previously included as part of other international  have been regrouped into either the new europe  middle east and africa emea or latin america and asia pacific laap region  in accordance with the markets in which each respective distributor operates 
previously reported geographical net sales information for fiscal years and has been reclassified to reflect this change 
all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december of the particular year 
overview since our initial public offering in  our net sales have steadily increased from million in to  million in  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of for this period 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty  our long term goal is to capitalize on global market opportunities for each of our key product categories 
we are committed to our growth strategies of enhancing the channel productivity of our existing customers  leveraging our brands internationally  further developing our existing merchandise categories  increasing our penetration into the department store and specialty footwear channels and expanding the global awareness of our brands through license agreements 
with our well developed sourcing and distribution infrastructure and proven design and product development team  we believe that we are well positioned for future long term growth 
highlights for the year ended december  include the following net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with contributed two percentage points of consolidated net sales growth 
our sales growth was largely attributable to increased sales in laap  followed by the united states  emea and canada 
from a product category perspective  our sales growth was predominantly attributable to increased sales of sportswear 
sportswear sales continued to outpace outerwear sales as our largest product category representing million  or  of net sales 
our backlog for the spring selling season remained constant at million as of september  compared to million for the comparable period in changes in currency exchange rates compared with contributed three percentage points of consolidated backlog 
accordingly  without these currency exchange rates changes backlog would have declined 
geographically  spring orders 
table of contents increased in our asia direct and international distributor markets  and decreased in the united states and europe direct 
global spring apparel orders remained flat  spring footwear orders decreased modestly and spring accessories and equipment orders increased modestly 
although we cannot predict with certainty any future results  our reported backlog is one indicator of our anticipated sales for the spring selling season 
many factors  however  could cause actual sales to differ materially from reported future order backlog 
moreover  our spring backlog is not indicative of  and should not be used in forecasting sales beyond the spring selling season 
for the year  gross profit increased basis points to in from in this expansion was primarily due to several factors  including modest increases in our average selling prices on spring products  lower freight costs and favorable hedged currency rates 
the favorable gross profit effect of these items was partially offset by increased sales of spring and fall close out product and higher international distributor shipments  both at lower gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel related costs to support our long term growth strategies and higher depreciation expense related to major distribution projects partially offset by lower commission expense in the united states 
net income increased to million in from million in  and diluted earnings per share increased to in from in net income was favorably affected by a lower effective tax rate in compared to our effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower rate in was primarily the result of the favorable conclusion of various united states and european tax examinations and the geographic mix of taxable income 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our common stock 
through december   we have repurchased approximately million shares  at an aggregate purchase price of million 
the repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time

sales by product category net sales from sportswear increased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of continued strength in our sportswear business  it remained our largest product category  representing of total sales 
we primarily attribute the increase in sportswear sales to higher sales in the united states  followed by emea  laap and canada 
the increase in sportswear sales was driven by a broader assortment of products  competitive pricing and related consumer demand  particularly fleece sweaters  knitted and woven tops and pants 
net sales from outerwear increased million  or less than  to million in from million in we primarily attribute the increase in outerwear sales to an increase in sales in laap  followed by canada  while sales of outerwear decreased in emea and the united states 
outerwear sales growth was driven by increased sales of our columbia and mountain hardwear brands across all regions  except emea direct 
growth in columbia brand outerwear sales in the united states was largely offset by a significant decrease in pacific trail outerwear sales 
the decrease in outerwear sales in emea direct was primarily due to the extended periods of unseasonably warm weather conditions throughout western europe during the fall and winter seasons of  which resulted in lower pre season orders from retailers for the fall season 
net sales from footwear increased million  or  to million in from million in footwear sales growth was led by laap  followed by emea and canada  while sales of footwear decreased in the united states 
we primarily attribute the increase in international footwear sales to higher sales of men s and women s spring footwear to key international distributor markets in the laap and emea regions 
the decrease in footwear sales in the united states was primarily due to higher than average volumes of fall columbia and sorel cold weather footwear product remaining in inventories at retailers resulting in lower orders from those retailers for fall products 
net sales from accessories and equipment increased million  or  to million in from million in accessories and equipment sales growth was led by laap  followed by the united states and emea  partially offset by a decrease in net sales in canada 
the increase in sales of accessories and equipment in our laap region was primarily related to expanded distribution and increased consumer demand

sportswear sales growth was primarily attributable to strong sales of fleece and sweaters 
growth in sales of columbia brand outerwear was largely offset by a significant decrease in pacific trail outerwear sales 
the decrease in footwear sales was primarily due to higher than average volumes of fall columbia and sorel cold weather footwear product remaining in inventories at retailers resulting in lower orders from those retailers for fall products and to a lesser degree  a decrease in montrail footwear sales 

table of contents net sales in the emea region increased million  or  to million in from million in changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with contributed six percentage points of emea net sales growth 
the increase in net sales in the emea region was led by sportswear  followed by footwear and accessories and equipment  partially offset by a decrease in outerwear sales 
our emea direct business was negatively affected by extended periods of unseasonably warm weather conditions throughout western europe during the fall and winter seasons of  which resulted in lower pre season orders from retailers buying less outerwear for the fall season 
emea direct net sales decreased as the result of decreased sales in the united kingdom  italy and spain 
in response to business challenges in emea direct  we reorganized our european management team in the second half of and reestablished strong connections between our european and us product teams to ensure more direction and interaction as we realign our european product assortments with consumers expectations 
our emea distributor business growth was largely the result of increased sales of outerwear  sportswear and footwear by our distributor in russia 
net sales in the laap region increased million  or  to million in from million in changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with contributed one percentage point of laap net sales growth 
sales growth in the laap region was led by our laap distributor business  followed by our korea and japan businesses 
sales growth was led by footwear  followed by sportswear  outerwear and accessories and equipment 
sales growth by our laap distributors was largely the result of increased sales by our distributor in china  primarily due to increased sales of footwear 
the increase in korea sales resulted from the opening of new stores and continued growth of columbia outerwear sales

sales growth was led by sportswear  followed by outerwear and footwear  while sales of accessories and equipment decreased 
cold weather conditions during the fourth quarter of resulted in a higher volume of close out product sales compared to the same period in gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in we primarily attribute the increase in gross profit margin to modest increases in our average selling prices on spring products  lower freight costs and favorable hedged currency rates 
the favorable gross profit effect of these items was partially offset by increased sales of spring and fall close out product and higher international distributor shipments  both at lower gross margins 
improvement in foreign currency hedge rates for our spring and fall selling seasons favorably affected our gross profit 
since our global supply of inventory is generally purchased with us dollars  the gross profit of our direct international businesses is partially dependent on the valuation of the us dollar 
for our spring and fall selling seasons  the hedge rates for our european and canadian direct businesses improved from our spring and fall selling seasons 
an increase in close out product sales at lower gross margins compared to had a negative effect on our consolidated gross profits 
we primarily attribute this increase to elevated close out sales levels in  due to unseasonably cool weather conditions in the early part of the spring season in the united states and earlier shipments of fall close outs compared to our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
we  like others  have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense

the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from an increase in depreciation expense and personnel related costs 
depreciation and amortization included in general and administrative expenses totaled million for compared to million for the increase in depreciation expense is primarily related to the portland and cambrai distribution center projects

net sales from outerwear increased million  or  to million in from million in we primarily attribute the increase in outerwear sales to an increase in sales in the united states  followed by emea  laap and canada 
outerwear unit sales growth in the united states was the result of an expanded line of outerwear styles for the columbia brand as well as sales resulting from our acquisition of the pacific trail brand 
we expanded our fall columbia outerwear product line due to increased global competition 
international outerwear sales growth was attributable to continued strength in certain key international distributor markets and our ability to capitalize on our expanded fall product line 
net sales from footwear increased million  or  to million in from million in footwear sales growth was led by emea  followed by laap  while sales of footwear decreased in canada and the united states 
our footwear unit sales growth was driven by incremental sales of montrail branded footwear

net sales from accessories and equipment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in accessories and equipment sales was the result of increased sales in all major geographic regions

net sales in the emea region increased million  or  to million in from million in the percentage increase in emea sales was not affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
sales growth in the emea region was led by our emea direct business followed by our emea distributor business

emea direct sales increased primarily as the result of increased sales in switzerland  france and italy while sales in other key markets including spain  germany and the united kingdom decreased 
sales growth in switzerland was partially attributable to the acquisition of our distributor in switzerland  tecnisport sa  in july partially offsetting that growth  our emea direct business was negatively affected by competitive pressures coupled with a key customer s decision to expand its private label program  which resulted in reduced outerwear and footwear orders from that key customer 
warm weather conditions throughout europe during the third and fourth quarters also affected europe sales unfavorably

warm weather conditions  primarily in eastern canada  during the third and fourth quarters negatively affected cold weather apparel and footwear shipments 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in we primarily attribute the decrease in gross profit margin to increased competition and inefficiencies in our fall product line  lower gross margins on pacific trail and montrail shipments and various other less significant items  including stock based compensation expense  european anti dumping duties imposed on chinese and vietnamese footwear imports and certain international promotional campaigns 
the negative gross margin effect of these items was partially offset by a reduction in sales of close out products 
the most significant factor that adversely affected our gross profit margins was increased competition in the united states and emea direct 
as a result of these competitive pressures  we broadened our product assortment  resulting in sourcing inefficiencies  and more competitively priced our fall products  both of which negatively affected our gross profit margins 
a decrease in close out sales at higher gross margins compared to had a favorable effect on our consolidated gross profits

business strategy and outlook our business  like other branded consumer product companies  is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns 
our net sales volumes are affected in the near term by macro economic forces that cause fluctuations in those patterns and the resulting actions of our wholesale customers 
in the second half of  several macro economic trends emerged in the us that appear to be causing a general slowing of retail sales  particularly in the department and specialty store channels that represent the largest proportion of our sales 
a growing number of leading economists are predicting a us recession commencing sometime in us recessions have sometimes triggered or worsened recessions in other key european and asian markets in which we operate 
in the past  economic trends of this nature have often resulted in our wholesale customers taking a more cautious approach when placing advance orders for seasonal products 
although we cannot yet predict how the current economic environment will affect our wholesale customers orders for fall  the bulk of which we will receive by march   we have chosen to invest in two strategies a demand creation strategy and a retail expansion strategy 
our demand creation strategy is designed to stimulate increased consumer demand 
this strategy includes increased levels of integrated marketing activities  including expanded print  television  outdoor and internet advertising  enhanced in store displays and merchandising techniques executed in partnership with various wholesale customers  and increased public relations and other brand communications focusing on what we believe are our superior apparel and footwear technologies  performance features and styling 
we can  to some degree  adjust the amount of our demand creation spending in response to the volume of fall bookings we receive from our wholesale customers 
we believe however  that increasing this spending over prior year levels will stimulate consumer demand  enhance our brand equity  grow our market share and be accretive to earnings in the long term 
our retail expansion strategy is designed to improve inventory management and distribution of excess and end of season products in the us with minimal disruption to our wholesale distribution channels 
this strategy involves opening approximately new outlet stores in key us outlet centers in each of the next few years  building on our base of existing outlet stores 
in addition  we plan to open several new first line retail stores for our brands in key metropolitan markets in order to provide a comprehensive environment to communicate key marketing initiatives  breadth of assortments and expert service levels expected from demanding consumers 
we have signed leases for several new outlet locations and we are in various stages of negotiations on the remaining new outlet locations for we expect to open all new outlet locations by mid november in anticipation of the holiday shopping season 
we have not signed any leases for new first line stores but we are in various stages of exploration and negotiation on several locations 
the timing of opening our new first line stores is dependent upon successfully concluding our explorations and negotiations 

table of contents we expect our expanded retail initiative  coupled with our planned increases in marketing and advertising during a period of uncertain consumer trends  will negatively affect our operating income and may preclude us from achieving operating margin leverage or increased profitability in compared with however  we expect these investments to establish sustainable platforms that will support improved long term growth and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and for the continued growth of the business 
we financed our operations for the year ended december  primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of a higher level of inventory to support our outlet store expansion plan  higher levels of carryover  core and replenishment inventory  and to early spring inventory receipts to support our product marketing initiatives 
our primary capital requirements are for working capital  investing activities associated with the expansion of our global operations and general corporate needs 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in in  our investing activities primarily consisted of the net sales of short term investments of million partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in consisted of approximately million in maintenance capital expenditures and million for other capacity and growth initiatives 
in  our investing activities primarily consisted of million used for capital expenditures and million used for the acquisitions of montrail and pacific trail  net of million provided by the sale of the acquired dockers licenses 
capital expenditures in mostly related to the expansion of our distribution center in cambrai  france and the upgrade of our distribution center in portland  oregon 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in in  net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of common stock at an aggregate price of million  payment of dividends of million  the net repayments of notes payable of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of million 
in  net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of common stock at an aggregate price of million  the net repayments of notes payable of million and of long term debt of million and payment of a dividend of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of million 
to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed 
at december   no balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined limit of approximately million at december   of which million is designated as a european customs guarantee 
at december   no balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 

table of contents the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter total installment payments product purchase obligations operating leases non related parties related party we have recorded fin liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december  of approximately million  however  they have not been included in the table above because we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
installment payments consist of purchase obligations made in the ordinary course of business for non product purchases 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required  including any imputed interest  by contracts and agreements 
product purchase obligations consist of open production purchase orders for sourced apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories  and materials used to manufacture apparel 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet at december  operating lease obligations include retail space operating leases  which often include real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance cam  and other costs in addition to base rent 
operating lease obligations listed above do not include real estate taxes  insurance  cam  and other costs for which we are obligated 
total expense related to real estate taxes  insurance  cam  and other costs related to these leases for the year ended december  was million and is included in sg a expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million issued for purchase orders for inventory 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should result in an appropriate level of protection against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from production purchases  intercompany transactions and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk primarily by using forward exchange contracts and options to hedge various firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 

table of contents the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we did not have any long term debt obligations at december  or we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest on those lines floats and is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
at december   our bank lines of credit did not have a balance 
at december   our bank lines of credit had a million balance  and thus no material interest rate exposure existed 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the provision for potential excess  close out and slow moving inventory  product warranty  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates  the development and selection of these accounting estimates  and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the united states where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly where we sell directly in western europe  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to seven days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and 
table of contents claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
over the three year period ended december   our actual annual sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers were less than two percent of net sales 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience  and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
when we evaluate our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical claim rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we make such a determination 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record an appropriate quarterly income tax provision  in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year to date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  under which compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fair value of employee stock based compensation 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the effect of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations include amortization of all stock based compensation granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and amortization of all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
accordingly  under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price of our employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as allowed under sfas no 
r  we estimate stock based compensation for stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
in addition  pursuant to sfas no 
r  we estimate forfeitures when calculating stock based compensation expense  rather than accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was our previous method 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the expense recorded in the current period
