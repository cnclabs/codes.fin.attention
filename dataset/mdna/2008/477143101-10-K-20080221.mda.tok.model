item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an innovative  low cost passenger airline that provides award winning customer service primarily on point to point routes 
we offer our customers a high quality product  including generous legroom  free in flight entertainment  pre assigned seating  unlimited snacks and reliable performance 
we currently serve destinations in states  puerto rico  mexico and the caribbean and operate over flights a day with a fleet of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
in  we reported net income of million and an operating margin of  compared to a net loss of million and an operating margin of in we achieved these results despite operational challenges in the first quarter and record high fuel prices  through revenue optimization  continued cost discipline and strategically managing our growth 
in the first quarter of  we were negatively impacted by an ice storm which hit the new york metropolitan area and resulted in our cancelling approximately  flights over a six day period 
following our recovery from the storm  we appointed russell chew as our chief operating officer who led our successful implementation of a multi phased strategy to improve our overall operating reliability  better handle of irregular operations which includes preemptive cancellations for severe weather  and improve customer communications 
we further demonstrated our industry leading commitment to our customers with the introduction of the jetblue airways customer bill of rights which provides for compensation to our customers who are inconvenienced by service disruptions within our control 
we believe that we have emerged from a better airline through these strategic changes  which also have contributed to our improved operating results 
the summer of was one of the worst for flight delays in the new york metropolitan area  principally as a result of airlines over scheduling the capacity of the new york metropolitan airports during certain hours of the day 
in response to these chronic delays  the dot announced that beginning in  it would limit the number of flights in and out of jfk 
we believe that  along with other initiatives the faa and dot are undertaking to enhance capacity  these restrictions will help alleviate congestion in the nation s largest travel market and thereby enable us to operate more reliably  reduce costs and improve the customer experience 
in  we continued our focus on a more disciplined growth strategy  beginning with managing the growth  size and age of our fleet 
in march  we amended our airbus a purchase agreement  deferring four aircraft deliveries from to in  we further amended this purchase agreement  deferring delivery of aircraft  which had been scheduled for delivery in and  to and during  we sold three of our older airbus a aircraft and returned another to its lessor 
removing older aircraft from our fleet allows us to keep the average age of our fleet down and improves our efficiency  which results in a better experience for our customers as well as reduces maintenance costs 
we plan further sales and lease terminations of older aircraft in  including commitments to sell six a aircraft in in  we also amended our purchase agreement with embraer by slowing delivery of firm aircraft orders 
our origina l purchase agreement called for delivery of an average of embraer aircraft per year 
following the amendments  we slowed the pace of firm aircraft deliveries to an average of per year 
however  because we have embraer purchase options remaining  we retained the flexibility to increase deliveries if demand warrants 
in december  we exercised purchase options for three embraer aircraft to be delivered in which purchase options would have otherwise expired 
our growth in was achieved largely through expanding our existing route network by adding frequencies and new routes between existing destinations 
we added only five new destinations in  compared to the that were added in in late  we made the decision to close our stations in nashville  tn and columbus  oh  which allowed us to redeploy aircraft to more profitable routes 
in  we plan to continue to focus on adding service between existing destinations and rational growth in the number of new destinations  including the january additions of puerto plata in the dominican republic and st 
maarten in the netherlands antilles 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we plan on opening our new gate terminal at jfk s terminal  or t t has an optimal airside location  which we believe will increase the efficiency of our operations 
although we will be limited in the number of flights we can operate out of jfk during the airport s peak hours  we believe that t will allow us to continue to grow our operations at the airport 
we also believe that our customers will have an improved overall experience in t  including approximately self service kiosks  a lane security checkpoint and a wide variety of high quality concessions and wireless hotspots  which should differentiate us from our competitors in much the same way that our onboard flight experience has distinguished us from other airlines 
we have increased our revenues through the use of various distribution channels 
during  we began selling tickets through several online travel agencies  including expedia  travelocity and orbitz 
we also began collecting a telephonic reservation fee  with the goal of directing more traffic through jetblue 
com  our lowest cost distribution channel  in addition to generating more ancillary revenue 
we also introduced our cashless cabin initiative in november in order to help monetize ancillary revenue opportunities onboard our aircraft 
we are continuing to evaluate additional revenue generating options to improve the jetblue experience for our customers without compromising the jetblue brand 
in december  we announced plans to issue and sell approximately million shares of our common stock to deutsche lufthansa ag for approximately million  net of transaction costs 
following the consummation of this transaction in january  deutsche lufthansa ag currently owns approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock 
we believe that this investment by one of the most highly respected leaders and most recognized brands in the global airline industry is an affirmation of the jetblue brand and business model 
the proceeds of this financing will be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue was of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  excluding puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight  which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare and  in certain markets  utilize our network to maximize connecting opportunities while continuing to provide our customers with low fares 
when we enter a new market  our low fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems sold to other airlines 
we maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry due to the young average age of our fleet  a productive workforce  and a strong commitment to cost discipline 
in  we plan to continue our focus on cost control while improving the jetblue experience for our customers 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our employees  including provisions for our profit sharing plan 
unlike most airlines  we have a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive  although we are subject to ongoing attempts at unionization 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global 
table of contents economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising and fees paid to credit card companies 
our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because the majority of our customers book directly through our website or our agents 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs  gains on aircraft sales and taxes other than payroll taxes  including fuel taxes 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
the airline industry has been intensely competitive in recent years  due in part to persistently high fuel prices and the adverse financial condition of many of the domestic airlines 
in us airways and america west merged  and each of delta air lines and northwest airlines filed for bankruptcy protection 
both delta and northwest emerged from bankruptcy in with lower costs  which is allowing them to compete more vigorously 
through and into  there have been other reports of potential consolidation within the industry 
we are unable to predict what the effect of further industry consolidation would be for us or for the airline industry in general 
in  most traditional network airlines continued to increase capacity on their international routes and only slightly increased their domestic capacity 
these developments  in conjunction with our shift of capacity from some transcontinental flights to more short and medium haul routes  con tributed to our improved financial performance in our ability to be profitable in this competitive environment depends on  among other things  operating at costs equal to or lower than those of our competitors  continuing to provide high quality customer service and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to be profitable in new and existing markets 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april  and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
outlook for our focus in will continue to be on disciplined growth  rigorous cost control and revenue optimization 
we expect the year over year upward trend in yield and rasm to continue through as a result of our overall decreased domestic capacity and maturity of our markets 
in addition  we are continuously looking to expand our other revenue opportunities  including charter services  marketing alliances  and through our introduction of refundable fares 
we expect our full year operating capacity for to increase approximately to over with the addition of new airbus a aircraft and six new embraer aircraft to our operating fleet  offset by the planned sale of six of our airbus a aircraft during the year 
in our 
table of contents efforts to create a growth plan that is sustainable  we may modify our rate of growth over the next few years through a combination of additional aircraft sales  returns  assignments and or delivery deferrals 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over our operating margin is expected to be between and and our pre tax margin is expected to be between and for the full year 
results of operations the us domestic airline environment continues to be extremely challenging primarily due to high aircraft fuel prices and vigorous price competition 
however  due to the optimization of our own fare mix  average fares for the year increased over to  while load factor declined points to from the full year our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in our on time performance was affected by our commitment to operate our scheduled flights whenever possible  along with operating at three of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us  as reflected by our and completion factors in and  respectively 
year compared to year we reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in in  we had operating income of million  an increase of million over  and our operating margin was  up points from diluted earnings per share was for and for operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the million increase in passenger revenues was attributable to a increase in yield due to higher average fare offset by a slightly lower load factor 
passenger revenues were also higher due to a increase in departures 
other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to higher change fees and excess baggage fees of million resulting from more passengers and higher rates 
other revenue also increased due to higher livetv third party revenues of million  rental income of million  mail revenues of million and the marketing component of trueblue point sales of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to operating an average of additional aircraft  which resulted in higher capacity  and a increase in average fuel price per gallon 
operating capacity increased to billion available seat miles in due to having more average aircraft in service 
our increase in capacity was partially offset by a reduction in available seat miles due to the removal of a row of seats on our airbus a aircraft in the first quarter of operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
excluding fuel  our cost per available seat mile increased in in detail  operating costs per available seat mile were percent changes are based on unrounded numbers

during the third and fourth quarters of  we sold a total of three airbus a aircraft  which resulted in gains of million and million  respectively 
excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we have continued to experience significant revenue growth  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million at december  the increase in our cash and investment balances during resulted primarily from our results from operations and net proceeds from the sale of three of our aircraft 
we presently have no lines of credit other than two short term borrowing facilities for certain aircraft predelivery deposits 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in  million in  and million in the million increase in cash flows from operations in compared to 
table of contents was primarily as a result of the growth of our business 
cash flows from operations in compared to also increased due to the growth of our business  offset in part by the increase in fuel prices 
net cash used in investing and financing activities was million in  million in  and million in investing activities 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for aircraft and four spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
expenditures related to the construction of our new terminal at jfk totaled million 
net cash provided by the sale of investment securities was million 
other investing activities included the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of three airbus a aircraft  the release of million related to restricted cash that collateralized a letter of credit we had posted in connection with our new terminal lease at jfk and the refund of million in flight equipment deposits related to aircraft delivery deferrals 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for aircraft and five spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
net cash used for the purchase of investment securities was million 
other investing activities included the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of five airbus a aircraft and the refund of million in flight equipment deposits related to aircraft delivery deferrals 
financing activities 
financing activities during consisted primarily of the sale and leaseback over years of seven embraer aircraft for million by a us leasing institution  our issuance of million in fixed rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by eight airbus a aircraft  our issuance of million in floating rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by two airbus a aircraft  reimbursement of construction costs incurred for our new terminal at jfk of million  the financing of four spare engine purchases of million  scheduled maturities of million of debt and the repayment of million of debt in connection with the sale of three airbus a aircraft 
financing activities during consisted primarily of the sale and leaseback over years of embraer aircraft for million by a us leasing institution  our issuance of million in fixed rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by nine airbus a aircraft and one embraer aircraft  our issuance of million in floating rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by two airbus a aircraft  our issuance of million in fixed and floating rate debt to various us and european financial institutions secured by eight airbus a aircraft  five of which were refinanced  reimbursement of construction costs incurred for our new terminal at jfk of million  the financing of previously unsecured owned assets for million  scheduled maturities of million of debt and the repayment of million of debt in connection with the sale of five airbus a aircraft 
in june  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec relating to our sale  from time to time  in one or more public offerings of debt securities  pass through certificates  common stock  preferred stock and or other securities 
the net proceeds of any securities we sell under this registration statement may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
through december   we had issued a total of million of pass through certificates under this registration statement to finance certain previously purchased aircraft spare parts 
in january  we completed the issuance and sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock  to deutsche lufthansa ag for approximately million  net of transaction costs 
at the closing of the stock sale  we and deutsche lufthansa ag entered into a registration rights agreement covering the shares pursuant to which we are required  within days after the closing date  to file with the 
table of contents sec a post effective amendment or supplement to our automatic shelf registration statement filed on june  to allow deutsche lufthansa ag to resell the shares 
subject to blackout periods that do not exceed trading days in any day period  we are obligated to keep such shelf registration statement continuously effective under the securities act of until the earlier of the date as of which all of the shares have been sold and the date as of which all of the shares may be sold without registration pursuant to rule under the securities act of none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
our short term borrowings consist of two floating rate facilities  each with a group of commercial banks to finance aircraft predelivery deposits 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
we do not currently have any lines of credit  other than our short term aircraft predelivery deposit facilities  and virtually all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and the remaining were financed by secured debt 
financing in the form of secured debt or leases has been arranged for all of our airbus a aircraft and for all six of our embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million at december   which is customary for airlines since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability  compared to working capital of million at december  included in our working capital deficit is million of indebtedness related to our convertible notes due  which is now classified as a current liability because we expect holders of these notes to exercise their option to have us repurchase them on their first purchase date of july  we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by debt and or equity financings and proceeds from aircraft sale and leaseback transactions 
we a lso plan to sell six additional airbus a aircraft in and may further reduce our obligations through additional aircraft sales and or return of leased aircraft 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as continued unprecedented high fuel prices  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
as of december   million of our short term investments were invested in auction rate securities  or arss 
we also had million of restricted cash invested in arss 
through february   we had reduced our total investments in arss to million  principally by investing in other short term investments as individual ars reset periods came due and the securities were once again subject to the auction process 
the million we have invested in arss at february  is collateralized by portfolios of student loans  substantially all of which is guaranteed by the united states government 
through february   auctions for million of these securities were not successful  resulting in our continuing to hold these securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to more these securities will be unsuccessful in th e near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been affected 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
excluding arss  at february   we had approximately 
table of contents million in cash and short term investments 
we believe the working capital available to us  including the proceeds from our recent equity financing with lufthansa will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions

includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was years at december  none of our debt instruments contain financial covenants 
our spare parts pass through certificates issued in november require us to maintain certain non financial collateral coverage ratios  which could require us to provide additional spare parts collateral or redeem some or all of the related equipment notes 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment was collateralized 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire from to five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related lease terms 
including the effects of a january amendment to our airbus purchase agreement  our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in each of and  in  in  in  and in we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
in november  we executed a year lease agreement with the port authority of new york and new jersey  or panynj  for the construction and operation of a new terminal at jfk 
the aggregate cost of this project is estimated at million and it is expected to be completed in late we are committed to making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution and facility rents that are anticipated to commence upon the date of beneficial occupancy 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the new terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj reimburses us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that will be provided by us  million of which was spent through 
table of contents december  for financial reporting purposes  this project will be accounted for as a financing obligation because we currently do not believe we will qualify for sale and leaseback accounting due to our continuing involvement in the property following the construction period 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases for are projected to be approximately million 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless either the employee or we elect not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities  as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of our liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we utilize a policy provider to provide credit support on the class g and class g certificates 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet  which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a 
table of contents thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financials statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer in the air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights that are expected to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
the amortization of our purchased technology  which resulted from our acquisition of livetv in  is based on the average number of aircraft in service and expected to be in service as of the date of their acquisition 
this method results in an increasing annual expense through when the last of thes e aircraft are expected to be placed into service and is adjusted to reflect changes in our contractual delivery schedule 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive cash flow  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r in required the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock option plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the pro forma disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards under sfas r  which is the same valuation technique we previously used for pro forma disclosures under sfas the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subje ctive assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a lattice model  which incorporates our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
the expected term for our employee stock purchase plan valuation is based on the length of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the offering period 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of two year publicly traded options on our common stock as of the option grant date 
our decision to use a blend of historical and implied volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
regardless of the 
table of contents method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease t erm and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a million asset related to the net fair value of our derivative instruments 
the majority of our derivative instruments are traded on active market exchanges 
fair values are assigned based on commodity prices that are provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
sfas is a complex accounting standard  requiring that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred effective portions of gains and losses hav e been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  which are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards  including an estimate for partially earned awards 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
in estimating the liability  we currently assume that of earned awards will be redeemed and that of our outstanding points will ultimately result in awards 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the min imum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
we also sell trueblue points to participating partners 
revenue from these sales is allocated between passenger revenues and other revenues 
the amount attributable to passenger revenue is determined based on the fair value of transportation expected to be provided when awards are redeemed and is recognized when travel is provided 
total sales proceeds in excess of the estimated transportation fair value is recognized at the time of sale 
deferred revenue was million at december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by the end of interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for measured as of decembe r  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
