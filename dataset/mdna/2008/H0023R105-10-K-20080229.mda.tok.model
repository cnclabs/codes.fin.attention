overview ace limited ace is a bermuda based holding company incorporated with limited liability under the cayman islands companies law 
ace and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are a global property and casualty p c insurance and reinsurance organization  servicing the insurance needs of commercial and individual customers in more than countries and jurisdictions 
our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility 
our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income 
by doing so  we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
our senior management team is well seasoned in the insurance industry and its attention to operational efficiency  maintaining balance sheet strength  and enforcing strong underwriting and financial discipline across the whole organization has laid the foundation for sustained earnings and book value growth 
we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities 
profit centers can access various legal entities  subject to licensing and other regulatory rules 
profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk adjusted returns 
this corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center s senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base 
we are an underwriting organization and senior management is focused on delivering underwriting profit 
we strive to achieve underwriting income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept 
we will not sacrifice underwriting income for growth 
distinction in service is an additional area of focus and a means to set us apart from our competition 
as an insurance and reinsurance company  we generate gross revenues from two principal sources premiums and investment income 
cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses  policy acquisition costs  and administrative expenses 
invested assets are generally held in liquid  investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration 
we invest in equity securities in the us and international markets 
a small portion of our assets are held in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk adjusted returns 
claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements 
the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates  stock market volatility  and credit events such as corporate defaults 
the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends  inflation rates  court awards  and catastrophes 
we believe that our cash balance  our highly liquid investments  credit facilities  and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead 
on december   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with aon corporation  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase all the outstanding shares of capital stock of combined insurance company of america combined and fourteen combined subsidiaries 
the all cash purchase price is billion  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
combined  which was founded in and is headquartered in glenview  illinois  is a leading underwriter and distributor of specialty individual accident and supplemental health insurance products that are targeted to middle income consumers in the us  europe  canada  and asia pacific 
combined serves more than four million policyholders worldwide 
we expect this transaction to be completed during the second quarter of we believe that this acquisition will add balance and capability to our existing accident and health a h business and offers meaningful opportunity for future revenue and earnings growth 
outlook the insurance industry is highly competitive with many companies offering similar coverage 
the rates and terms and conditions related to the products we offer have historically changed depending on the timing of the insurance cycle 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable terms and conditions 
pricing and terms and conditions are generally more favorable during periods of reduced underwriting capacity 

table of contents the p c industry is currently in a period of excess underwriting capacity and  as a result  prices are declining globally 
the rate of decline is accelerating in some classes and staying relatively flat in others 
overall  the market continues to become more competitive and  given these conditions  we are focused on maintaining the levels of our renewals and writing less new business 
this is reflected in our net premiums written which decreased slightly in  compared with despite this downward trend  we continue to see opportunity to expand our p c business in the short and longer term in many places as we adapt our business to take advantage of the macroeconomic trends and the risks that accompany them taking place around the world 
with considerable balance sheet strength  we also have the ability to grow both organically and opportunistically though acquisitions 
our a h business continues to do well  growing percent in  compared with we continue to see good long term opportunity to grow our a h franchise  particularly in the developing markets of asia pacific and latin america  among other territories 
our life insurance and reinsurance business also had a very good year and together with a h and the addition of combined will represent close to percent of our net premiums earned  on a pro forma basis 
the financial markets crisis  which was triggered by defaults of sub prime mortgages in the third quarter of  continues to dominate the landscape and is spreading to other forms of credit and beyond the us this is contributing to a significant slowdown in the us economy  and possibly recession  and we believe this will have a global impact 
at the same time  there is the specter of inflation  and efforts to stimulate the us economy may well increase the risk of inflation 
inflation and recession can have an impact on p c operating results particularly revenue and claims frequency and severity 
the financial and economic conditions are deteriorating in the face of a soft and softening global p c market 
we are adjusting quickly to ensure all levels of our underwriting organization  with the support of our claims and actuarial groups  focus on and manage risk with a clear recognition of the environment 
on the asset side of the balance sheet  our conservative investment posture has served us well 
our exposure to sub prime asset backed securities was million at december   which represented less than one percent of our investment portfolio 
refer to investments for more information 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the sub prime crisis will be a sizable casualty event for the commercial p c industry and particularly for those who have significant financial institution exposure 
while we are underwriters of financial institution d o and e o business  it is not a significant part of our portfolio 
in fact  we are relatively modest participants in this segment of the market 
we estimate the size of the financial institutions market for d o and e o to be approximately billion in gross premiums written 
ace writes approximately million of gross premiums in connection with us exposed business which gives us less than a four percent market share 
our net premiums written are million and our average net limit is million for d o and million for e o 
all of the business is claims made  where determination of coverage is triggered by the date the insured first becomes aware of a claim or potential claim  and all legal defense expenses incurred by the insurer in defending the insured are covered under the policy 
we may have losses from sub prime related events  and we have reflected that in our loss and loss expense ratios as appropriate 
insurance industry investigations and related matters information on the insurance industry investigations and related matters is set forth in note f to the consolidated financial statements  under item critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  are determined using best estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment  actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented 
we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are unpaid loss and loss expense reserves  including asbestos and environmental a e reserves  reinsurance recoverable  including a provision for uncollectible reinsurance  impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib  the valuation of goodwill  and the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts 
we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled prior period development  asbestos and environmental 
table of contents and other run off liabilities  reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance  investments  net realized gains losses  and other income and expense items 
unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company  we are required  by applicable laws and regulations and gaap  to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
the estimate of the liabilities includes provision for claims that have been reported but unpaid at the balance sheet date case reserves and for future obligations from claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date ibnr may also include a provision for additional development on reported claims in instances where the case reserve is viewed to be insufficient 
the reserves provide for liabilities on the premium earned on policies as of the balance sheet date 
the loss reserve also includes an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling these unpaid claims loss expenses 
at december   our unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion 
with the exception of certain structured settlements  for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable  our loss reserves are not discounted for time value 
in connection with such structured settlements  we carry reserves of million net of discount

the following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves including loss expense reserves and ibnr reserves at december  and in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net case reserves ibnr total 
table of contents the following table segregates the loss reserves by line of business including property and all other  casualty  and personal accident a h at december  and in the table  loss expenses are defined to include unallocated and allocated loss adjustment expenses 
for certain lines  in particular ace international and ace bermuda products  loss adjustment expenses are included in ibnr and not in loss expenses 
in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net property and all other case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal casualty case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal a h case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal total case reserves loss expenses ibnr total the judgments used to estimate unpaid loss and loss expense reserves require different considerations depending upon the individual circumstances underlying the insured loss 
for example  the reserves established for an excess casualty claim  a e claims  losses from major catastrophic events  or the ibnr for product lines will each require different assumptions and judgments to be made 
necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed  or as current laws change 
hence  ultimate loss payments will differ from the estimate of the ultimate liability made at the balance sheet date 
changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves can impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors  which we explain below 
we establish loss and loss expense reserves to reflect our liabilities from claims for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write 
for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date  case reserves are established by claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim s  standard claim handling practices  and professional judgment 
in respect of those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date  there is by definition limited actual information to form the reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to project the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr 
furthermore  for our assumed reinsurance operation  global reinsurance  an additional case reserve may sometimes be established above the amount notified by the ceding company if the notified case reserve is judged to be insufficient by global reinsurance s claims department refer to assumed reinsurance below 
we have actuarial staff within each of our operating segments who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the required ibnr reserve 
ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of expected claims for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims 
the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may involve the use and interpretation of various actuarial projection methods as well 
table of contents as more qualitative factors that may impact the ultimate value of the losses such as actual loss experience  loss development patterns  and industry data 
in addition  since standard actuarial projection methods place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data and patterns  the estimate of the ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to consider the impact from more contemporary and subjective factors 
among some of the factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume  changes in ceded reinsurance structures  reported and projected loss trends  inflation  legal environment  and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties 
finally  adjustments may be required to ensure that the derived ibnr reflects the exposure arising on the earned portion of premium as at the balance sheet date 
typically  for each product line  one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and from these estimates a single actuarial provisional estimate is selected 
exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal  claims  and actuarial analysis and judgment ie  a e account projections or high excess casualty accounts in litigation 
in addition  claims arising from catastrophic events require evaluation based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post event impact that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods 
the standard actuarial reserving methods may include  but are not necessarily limited to  paid and reported loss development  expected loss ratio  and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
a general description of these methods is provided below 
in the subsequent discussion on short and long tail business  reference is also made where appropriate to how consideration in method selection impacted results 
in addition to these standard methods  we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches depending upon the product line characteristics and available data 
to ensure that the projections of future loss emergence from historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business  the historical loss and premium data is required to be of sufficient homogeneity and credibility 
for example  to improve data homogeneity  we may group product line data further by similar risk attribute eg  geography  coverage such as property versus liability exposure  or origin year  project losses for these homogenous groups and then combine these results to provide the overall product line estimate 
the premium and loss data is aggregated by origin year eg  the year in which the losses were incurred or accident year and annual or quarterly periods subsequent to the origin year 
implicit in the standard accepted actuarial methodologies that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions first  the expected loss ratio for each origin year ie  accident  report  or underwriting and second  the pattern in which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year 
the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected giving consideration to a number of potential factors including historical loss ratios adjusted for intervening premium and loss trends  industry benchmarks  the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting  and other more subjective considerations of the product line and external environment as noted above 
for the more recent origin years  the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process 
this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management 
the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by taking this estimate of the initial expected ultimate loss ratio and multiplying by the corresponding premium base 
this method is most commonly used for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet credible enough to override our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratio 
in addition  the expected loss ratio may be modified should underlying assumptions such as loss trend or premium rate changes differ from the original assumptions 
our assumed paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored 
where possible  development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix  claims handling process  or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence 
for product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility  the selected development patterns will also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within ace 
this typically arises for product lines that are relatively immature or with high severity low frequency portfolios and for which our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and or lacks credibility 
the paid and reported loss development methods convert the assumed loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period 
due to their multiplicative nature  the paid and reported loss development methods magnify deviations between actual and expected loss emergence 
therefore  these methods tend to be favored for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method  under which the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures 
this approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss 
table of contents development methods which are favored at latter maturities 
we usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may be used 
the applicability of reserve methods will also be determined by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company 
in the case of low attachment points typical of primary or working layer reinsurance  the experience will tend to be more frequency driven 
these product types allow for the standard actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels  as it is often customary to have the appropriate historical record and volume of claims experience to rely upon 
in the case of high attachment points typical of excess insurance or excess of loss reinsurance  the experience will tend to be severity driven  as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer 
for structured or unique contracts  most common to the financial solutions business which we have ceased writing and  to a lesser extent  our reinsurance business  the standard actuarial methods need to be tempered with an analysis of each contract s terms  original pricing information  subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts  market exposures and history  and qualitative input from claims managers 
our recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date 
each product line has an actuarial reserve review performed and an actuarial provisional estimate is established at the review s conclusion 
the process to select the actuarial provisional estimate  when more than one estimate is available  may differ across product lines 
for example  an actuary may base the provisional estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses 
the availability of estimates by different projection techniques will depend upon the product line  the underwriting circumstances  and the maturity of the loss emergence 
for a well established product line with sufficient volume and history  the actuarial provisional estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and or bornhuetter ferguson methods 
however  for a new long tail product line for which we have limited data and experience or a rapidly growing line  the emerging loss experience will unlikely have sufficient stability to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter ferguson methods and reliance will be placed upon the initial expected loss ratio method as the actuarial provisional estimate until the experience matures 
the actuarial provisional estimate is then developed into management s best estimate with collaboration with underwriting  claims  legal  and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees 
each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial  finance  claims  and executive management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the estimate to be used as management s best estimate 
reserves are further reviewed by ace s chief actuary and senior management 
the objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other 
such an estimate is viewed by management to support the most likely outcome of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors including  but not limited to segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods  extent of internal historical loss data  and industry where required  historical variability of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience  perceived credibility of emerged loss experience  and nature and extent of underlying assumptions 
management does not build in any specific provision for uncertainty 
we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies 
in particular  ranges are not necessarily a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement value of losses 
this is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically been reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements  in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date 
while we believe that our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management s best estimate for each product line as of the current valuation date  future changes to our view of the ultimate liabilities are possible 
a five percent change in our net loss reserves equates to billion and represents percent of our net income before taxes for and seven percent of shareholders equity at december  historically  including a e reserve charges  our reserves  at times  have developed in excess of percent of recorded amounts 
refer to analysis of losses and loss expense development  under item for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements 
we perform internal loss reserve studies for all product lines at least once a year  the timing of such studies varies throughout the year 
external loss reserve studies are performed periodically and are compared to our internal results 
additionally  each quarter for each product line  we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations used in reserving 
if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests  we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies 
finally  external loss reserve studies are performed annually and are compared to our internal results to ensure reasonability of internal findings 

table of contents the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim s is referred to as the claim tail 
the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short tail and long tail product lines 
in this section  we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions 
refer to segment operating results for more information on prior period development 
short tail business short tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs 
this would include  for example  most property  personal accident  aviation hull  and automobile physical damage policies that are written 
there are some exceptions on certain product lines eg  workers compensation catastrophe or events eg  major hurricanes where the event has occurred  but the final settlement amount is highly variable and not known with certainty for a potentially lengthy period 
due to the short reporting development pattern for these product lines  our estimate of ultimate losses from any particular accident period responds quickly to the latest loss data 
we will typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence  such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  sooner than would be the case for long tail lines at a similar stage of development from the origin year 
the reserving process for short tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves the determination by the claims department  in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries  of our exposure and likely losses immediately following an event and the subsequent regular refinement of those losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information 
for the accident year  the short tail line loss reserves were typically established using the expected loss ratio method for the non catastrophe exposures 
in addition  reserves were also established for losses arising on catastrophe activity during the underlying calculation for the non catastrophe portion requires initial expected loss ratios by product line  as adjusted for actual experience during the progression of the calendar year 
as previously noted  the derivation of initial loss ratios incorporates actuarial assumptions on projections of prior years loss experience  past and future loss  and exposure trends  rate adequacy of new and renewal business  and ceded reinsurance costs 
in addition  we considered our view of terms and conditions and the market environment  which by their nature tend to be more judgmental relative to other factors 
for our short tail businesses taken as a whole  overall loss trend assumptions have not differed significantly relative to prior years 
because there is some random volatility of non catastrophe loss experience from year to year  we considered average loss experience over several years when developing loss estimates for the current accident year 
therefore  while there has been favorable loss development in recent years on non catastrophe exposures  the effect of this favorable development on expected loss ratios for the current accident year is relatively small 
further  other considerations  such as rate reductions and broadening of terms and conditions in a competitive market somewhat offset this favorable effect 
in terms of prior accident years  the bulk of changes made in the calendar year arose from the and accident years 
specifically  the insurance overseas general segment experienced million of favorable development due to lower than anticipated loss emergence on the and accident years and the insurance north american segment experienced million of adverse development related to and catastrophes 
in both instances  these prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for the respective to accident years to better reflect the latest reported loss data rather than any changes to underlying actuarial assumptions such as loss development patterns 
the process used to establish the year end reserves for the and catastrophes involved a detailed review by the claims department of the causation and coverage issues of each underlying claim 
given the unique circumstances around the events  historical trends and loss development patterns are not applicable 
as discussed in the prior period development discussions under segment operating results  the actual claims experience was worse than anticipated and  as such  the ultimate loss estimates were revised to reflect that loss emergence 
for the reserves covering the non catastrophe related exposures in the and prior accident years  the change in ultimate loss reflected recognition of actual favorable loss emergence rather than explicit changes to assumptions on the loss development patterns to project future loss emergence 
the actual non catastrophe related loss emergence over calendar years has been favorable but within a range of expected outcomes and the experience from these years was considered when establishing the expectation of accident year losses 
for a detailed analysis of changes in assumptions related to prior accident year reserves during calendar year  refer to prior period development 

table of contents long tail business long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and claims can take significant time to emerge 
this includes most casualty lines such as general liability  directors and officers liability d o and workers compensation 
there are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business 
among these are our historical loss data and experience is often too immature and lacking in credibility to place reliance upon for reserving purposes 
instead  we place reliance in our reserve methods on industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that are anticipated to reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development 
for such product lines  actual loss experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years  the inherent uncertainty around loss trends  claims inflation eg  medical and judicial and underlying economic conditions  the inherent uncertainty of the estimated duration of the paid and reporting loss development patterns beyond the historical record requires that professional judgment be used in the determination of the length of the patterns based on the historical data and other information  the inherent uncertainty of assuming historical paid and reported loss development patterns on older origin years will be representative of subsequent loss emergence on newer origin years 
for example  changes in establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can distort the development of paid and reported losses  the possibility of future litigation  legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses  loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner 
if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics  such as loss payment patterns  the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected 
additionally  since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured  there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses  and the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years 
as can be seen from the above  various factors are considered when determining appropriate data  assumptions  and methods used to establish the loss reserve for the long tail product lines 
these factors will also vary by origin year for given product lines 
the derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment  particularly with respect to the extent of historical loss experience that provides credible support to changes in key reserving assumptions 
examples of the relationship between changes in historical loss experience and key reserving assumptions are provided below 
for those long tail product lines that are less claim frequency and more claim severity oriented  such as professional lines and high excess casualty  we placed more reliance upon expert legal and claims review of the specific circumstance underlying reported cases rather than loss development patterns 
the assumptions used for these lines of business were updated in response to new claim and legal advice judged to be of significance 
for the accident year  loss reserves were typically established through the application of individual product line initial expected loss ratios that require contemplation of assumptions similar in nature to those noted in the short tail line discussion 
our assumptions on loss trend and development patterns reflect reliance on our historical loss data provided the length of history and homogeneity afford credibility 
given the recent growth on a number of product lines  such as general casualty and financial lines  our historical loss data is less extensive and our assumptions require judgmental use of industry loss trends and development patterns 
we note that industry patterns are not always available to match the nature of the business being written  this issue is particularly problematic for non us exposed lines 
given the underlying volatility of the long tail product lines and the lengthy period required for full paid and reported loss emergence  we typically assign little to no credibility to actual loss emergence in the recent development periods 
accordingly  we generally used the initial expected loss ratio method for the and immediately preceding origin years to establish reserves by product line 
we monitor actual paid and reported loss emergence with expected loss emergence for each key individual product line 
while recent experience has generally been favorable relative to our internal expectations  we do not yet believe experience is sufficiently credible for us to consider moving to loss based projection methods in setting reserves 
our best estimate based on information received to date for our loss ratios reflect what we believe is our exposure to sub prime losses e o and d o 
given the nature of long tail casualty business and related reserving considerations  for the major long tail lines in insurance north american  insurance overseas general  and global reinsurance  no changes of significance were made to 
table of contents the key actuarial assumptions for the loss trend aside from changes to inflation assumptions  exposure trend  and loss development patterns used to establish the accident year reserves relative to prior accident years 
typically for the accident years  to the extent that actual loss emergence in calendar year differed from our expectation in the more recent origin years  the deviation was not seen as sufficiently credible  particularly given the volatility and lengthy period for full loss emergence  to alter either our booked ultimate loss selections or the set of actuarial assumptions underlying the reserving review for that particular portfolio 
such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above 
however  for some product lines  credibility was assigned to emerging loss experience and this is discussed further below and in the section entitled prior period development 
for more mature accident years  typically and prior  we used paid and reported loss patterns in the reserve setting process on older accident years where sufficient credibility existed 
for those lines lacking data credibility  we placed reliance upon the latest benchmark patterns where available from external industry bodies such as insurance services office iso or the national council on compensation insurance  inc ncci 
accordingly  the assumptions used to project loss estimates will not fully reflect our own actual loss experience until credibility is determined 
in contrast to short tail lines  the prior period development in for long tail lines of business arose across a number of accident years in the insurance north american and insurance overseas general segments  typically more removed from the recent accident years 
the movements were generally the result of actual loss emergence in calendar year that differed materially from the expected loss emergence and these deviations were significant enough in certain product lines to warrant revising the projections 
the nature of the assumptions altered in  and impacting the prior accident years  varies by the specifics of each product line 
for example  in insurance north american the alterations to estimates for national account casualty and workers compensation lines involved retaining the original paid and reported loss development assumptions but assigning greater credibility to actual loss experience  ie more weight was given to paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods rather than the expected loss ratio methods on the accident years 
this resulted in million favorable development and million adverse development for the casualty and workers compensation lines  respectively 
similarly  for insurance overseas general  there was million of favorable development on the accident years as more weight was given to paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods rather than the expected loss ratio methods 
in addition  an update of our detailed annual evaluation of the excess exposures at insurance overseas general resulted in net favorable prior period development of million which comprised strengthening of million in accident years and prior and million in accident year and a release of million in accident years and while we believe our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december   is adequate  new information or emerging trends different from assumptions may lead to future developments in ultimate losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided  which could have a material effect on future operating results 
as noted previously  our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from any number of reserving methodologies rather than being a purely mechanical process 
therefore  it is difficult to convey  in a simple and quantitative manner  the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate 
in the examples shown below  we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described 
we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption 
insurance north american given the long reporting and paid development pattern  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our inactive middle market workers compensation business requires considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves 
specifically  when applying the paid loss development method  a one percent change in the tail factor ie  changed to either or would cause a change of approximately million  either positively or negatively  for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves 
this is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately million 
our ace bermuda operations write predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence first reported basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and limits of million gross or less and d o and other professional liability coverage on a claims made basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and limits of million gross or less 
claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as million per claim for professional liability and million per claim for excess liability depending on the nature of the loss 

table of contents insurance overseas general certain long tail lines  such as casualty and professional lines  are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation 
heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty of the reserving estimates 
our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment  it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments 
for example  when applying the reported loss development method  the lengthening by six months of our selected loss development patterns would increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
global reinsurance typically  there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reporting development patterns  especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability  which may take up to years to fully develop 
this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns as justified by the credibility of the data 
the underlying source and selection of the final development pattern can thus have a significant impact on the selected net losses and loss expenses ultimate 
for example  a twenty percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for us long tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
assumed reinsurance at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
in comparison  at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
for catastrophe business  we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information  including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants  ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers  and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves 
for our casualty reinsurance business  we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses 
due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies  as well as other factors  the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business 
these include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following the reported claims information could be inaccurate  typically  a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim 
the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag 
because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers  ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers  who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty 
the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations 
therefore  the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines  and the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available 
further  for certain coverages provided by products  such as excess of loss contracts  there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability 
in such cases  the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources 
we mitigate the above risks in several ways 
in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable  we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate  complete  and timely 
as appropriate  audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process 
we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses 

table of contents on occasion  there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premiums reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premiums reserves reported by the ceding companies 
this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves 
for ibnr  we use historical experience and other statistical information  depending on the type of business  to estimate the ultimate loss see unpaid losses and loss expenses for more information 
we estimate our unearned premiums reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty s coverage basis ie  risks attaching or losses occurring 
at december   the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were million  compared with the million we recorded 
our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant 
within the insurance north american segment  we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance north american segment 
most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to a e claims 
refer to asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities for more information 
asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims and expenses 
these claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment  including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims 
during  we conducted a review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of june  as a result of the internal review  we concluded that our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  were adequate and  therefore  no change to the carried reserve was required 
an internal review was also conducted during for our consolidated a e liabilities as of june  for that review  we concluded that our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  were adequate and  therefore  no change to the carried net reserve was required  while the gross loss reserves increased by approximately million 
in  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century indemnity company century 
this external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an external actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years 
the results of the external review were addressed with the pennsylvania insurance department and no changes to statutory basis loss reserves were deemed necessary 
our a e reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated future changes in the legal  social  or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms 
there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome 
we believe the most significant variables relating to our a e reserves include assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims  the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non products coverage  whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation  and payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants 
based on the policies  the facts  the law  and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account  we estimate the potential liability for indemnity  policyholder defense costs  and coverage litigation expense 
the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers  policyholders  and claimants

reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses  and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recover 
table of contents able to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts 
the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments 
the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers 
ceded ibnr  which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and  consequently  its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr refer to critical accounting estimates unpaid losses and loss expenses 
the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency  contractual dispute  or for other reasons 
amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and  in turn  shareholders equity 
changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income 
although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions  the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future  in some cases  several decades from now 
over this period of time  economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so  they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer 
this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment must be applied 
as part of the process  ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis 
the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts  adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses 
if actual experience varies materially from historical experience  including that used to determine ceded premium  the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change 
while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  it could  nevertheless  have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded 
generally  we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer  net of collateral  and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full 
the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in an ace only beneficiary trust  letters of credit  and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset 
we do not currently include multi beneficiary trusts 
however  we have several reinsurers that have established multi beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries 
the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
significant considerations and assumptions include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency  and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population ie  default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages  the judgment exercised by management to determine the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class 
default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa  aa  a  bbb  bb  b  and ccc  are percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
because the model we use is predicated on the default factors of a major rating agency  we do not generally consider alternative factors 
however  when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly rated reinsurer  such as certain property catastrophe claims  a default factor may not be applied  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent  affiliate  or peer company  we determine a rating equivalent based on an analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity  industry benchmarks  or other factors as considered appropriate 
we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class 
for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold  we generally apply a default factor of percent  
table of contents for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision  we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company 
upon initial notification of an insolvency  we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding  net of collateral  through a combination of write offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer  we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding  net of collateral 
when sufficient credible information becomes available  we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received  and for captives and other recoverables  management determines the provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances 
the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the provision for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december  in millions of us dollars total reinsurance recoverables recoverables net of usable collateral provision for uncollectible reinsurance type reinsurers with credit ratings reinsurers not rated reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers captives other structured settlements and pools total at december   the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and our liquidity 
given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision  we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
however  based on the composition particularly the average credit quality of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december   we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers i 
e  from a to a or a to bbb could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately million or approximately one percent of the reinsurance recoverable balance  assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation 
while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period  a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question

investments our fixed maturity investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
our available for sale portfolio is reported at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair value is determined using the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 
we regularly review our impaired investments ie  those debt securities for which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities for which fair value is below cost for a possible other than temporary impairment 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the book value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
an impairment is considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of the cost of the investment  and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary 
the determination as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary principally requires the following critical judgments i the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary  such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline  and ii for those securities to be assessed  whether we have the 
table of contents ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period  absent a significant change in facts that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs ie  arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe  internal risk management considerations  the financial condition of the issuer or its industry  market conditions  and new investment opportunities 
day to day management of the majority of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above 
we believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the majority of our portfolio as available for sale 
the gross unrealized loss at december   for all securities in a loss position was million with million in an unrealized loss position for over months million was related to fixed maturities held to maturity 
our net realized losses in included write downs of million of which million was related to fixed maturities 
this compares with write downs of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairments recorded in and were primarily due to an increase in market interest rates from the date of security purchase and as such  were not credit related 
because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity  adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results 
such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets and specific changes to industries  companies  or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings 
further  an increase in interest rates could result in an increased number of fixed maturities for which we cannot support the intent to hold to recovery 
more information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled net realized gains losses 
deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each tax jurisdiction 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was billion 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component proves to be incorrect  an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
at december   the valuation allowance of million including million with respect to foreign tax credits reflects management s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income or the inability to utilize foreign tax credits 
guaranteed minimum income benefits derivatives under reinsurance programs covering living benefit guarantees  we assume the risk of guaranteed minimum income benefits associated with variable annuity contracts 
our gmib reinsurance product meets the definition of a derivative for accounting purposes and is therefore carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains losses in the period of the change pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no

we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned  and to record estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows as incurred losses 
for gmib reinsurance  we recognize benefit reserves consistent with aicpa statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
changes in this reserve are included in life underwriting income

where we hold a derivative to maturity  the cumulative gains and losses will net to zero 
refer to note j to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for further description of this product and related accounting treatment 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity indices on the fair value of gmibs  and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
the fair value of gmib reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model which includes the use of management estimates and current market information 
all of our treaties contain claim limits  which are factored into the valuation model 
the fair value depends on a number of factors  including changes in interest rates  changes in equity markets  changes in market volatility  changes in policyholder behavior  and changes in policyholder mortality 
the model and related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the two most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates and annuitization rates using the guaranteed benefit gmib annuitization rate 
assumptions regarding lapse rates and gmib annuitization rates differ by treaty but the underlying methodology to determine rates applied to each treaty is comparable 
the assumptions regarding lapse and gmib annuitization rates determined for each treaty are based on a dynamic calculation that uses several underlying factors 
the effect of changes in key market factors on assumed lapse and annuitization rates is principally based on historical experience for variable annuity contracts as well as considerable judgment  particularly for newer benefits with limited historical experience 
a lapse rate is the percentage of in force policies surrendered in a given calendar year 
all else equal  as lapse rates increase  ultimate claim payments will decrease 
the gmib annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the customer will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the gmib 
all else equal  as gmib annuitization rates increase  ultimate claim payments will increase  subject to treaty claim limits 
key factors affecting the lapse rate assumption include investment performance and policy duration 
we generally assume that lapse rates increase with policy duration with a significant increase in rates after the end of the surrender charge period 
as investment performance of underlying fund investments declines  and guarantees become more valuable  lapse rates are anticipated to decrease thereby increasing the expected value of claims on minimum guarantees and thus benefit reserves and the incremental fair value liability 
key factors affecting the gmib annuitization rate include investment performance and interest rates after the gmib waiting period 
as investment performance of underlying fund investments declines  the monthly income available to a policyholder who annuitizes their account value falls  this makes the gmib more valuable 
as the gmib becomes more valuable  our modeling assumes that annuitization rates will increase  resulting in higher benefit reserves and fair value liability 
the same is true in an environment where long term interest rates are decreasing 
net realized losses for included million for gmib reinsurance  compared with nil in and net realized gains of million in  excluding changes in the fair value of specific derivative instruments held to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio

goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the fair value of net assets we acquired  was billion at december  the ace ina acquisition resulted in approximately percent of this balance 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation of impairment 
it is our policy to test goodwill as well as other intangible assets for impairments on an annual basis 
the impairment tests in  in the aggregate  show a fair value in excess of the carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at acquisition 
the most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ace ina acquired in  ace tempest re s catastrophe businesses acquired in and  and tarquin limited acquired in there are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions that are also assessed annually 
in our impairment tests  to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  we principally use both an earnings model  which considers forecasted earnings and other financial ratios of the reporting unit as well as relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit such as the relationship of price to earnings for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies  and an analysis of the present value of estimated net cash flows 
we must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operat 
table of contents ing segments  as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change  goodwill could be materially adjusted 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken 
risk transfer in the ordinary course of business  we both purchase or cede and sell or assume p c reinsurance protection 
in  as a matter of policy  we discontinued the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts 
for both ceded and assumed reinsurance  risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting  principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses 
if risk transfer requirements are not met  a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit  typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense 
to meet risk transfer requirements  a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk  consisting of underwriting and timing risk  and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity 
we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit 
contracts that include fixed premium ie  premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment 
reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions  such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience  and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits  can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met 
for such contracts  often referred to as finite or structured products  we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception 
to support risk transfer  the cash flow analyses must support the fact that a significant loss is reasonably possible  such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds percent 
for purposes of cash flow analyses  we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments 
in addition  to support insurance risk  we must prove the reinsurer s risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss 
to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed  quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products 
we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting 
if any criterion is triggered  a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our operating segments with reporting oversight  including peer review  from our global structured transaction review committee 
with respect to ceded reinsurance  we entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts  principally in  some of which remain in force 
these contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions 
because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly  these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program 
all of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance 
in addition  we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to  such as the national indemnity company nico contracts referred to in the section entitled  asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities 
subsequent to the ace ina acquisition  we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts 
with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts  products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business 
although we have ceased writing financial solutions business  several contracts remain in force and principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers 
because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products  relatively few p c insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met 
for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits  the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required  legally or otherwise  to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured 
a significant portion of ace tempest re usa s business is written through quota share treaties approximately million of net premiums earned in  comprised of million of first dollar quota share treaties and million of excess quota share treaties  some of which are categorized as structured products 
structured quota share treaties typically contain relatively low aggregate policy limits  a feature that reduces loss coverage in some manner and a profit sharing provision 
accounting standard setters for both gaap and statutory reporting have undertaken projects to re evaluate risk transfer guidance  including accounting models that could ultimately require the bifurcation of structured quota share treaties into 
table of contents insurance and financing elements  and perhaps other quota share contracts not currently categorized as structured  into a reinsurance and financing component 
new guidance in this area has the potential to have a significant impact on the amount of premiums and losses recognized under these contracts but we expect little impact to our net income

net premiums earned increased four percent in  compared with this increase was primarily related to increased production at ace usa and ace international as well as our life operations  partially offset by decreased production at our global reinsurance segment 
net premiums earned were stable in  compared with as increases in a h were offset by significant decreases in financial solutions business  which we have ceased writing 

table of contents net investment income increased percent in  compared with  and percent in  compared with these increases were primarily due to investment of positive operating cash flows and net proceeds from our approximately billion public offering in october  which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base 
in evaluating our p c business  we use the combined ratio  the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned 
we do not calculate these ratios for the life business as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that business 
the combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
a combined ratio under percent indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio exceeding percent indicates underwriting losses 
the following table shows our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio  policy acquisition ratio  administrative expense ratio  and combined ratio for the years ended december    and loss and loss expense ratio policy acquisition cost ratio administrative expense ratio combined ratio the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended december    and loss and loss expense ratio  as reported catastrophe losses prior period development loss and loss expense ratio  adjusted we recorded million in net catastrophe losses in  compared with million in  and billion in for  our catastrophe losses were primarily related to floods in the uk  australia  and the us and also include the impact of european windstorm kyrill 
in  the catastrophe losses were primarily associated with hurricanes katrina  rita  and wilma 
prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years 
we experienced million of net favorable prior period development in this compares with million of net favorable prior period development in  and million of net adverse prior period development in the favorable prior period development in was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements  refer to prior period development 
our loss and loss expense ratio was negatively impacted by an increase in current year accident losses  reflecting current market conditions 
our policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes  underwriting  and other costs that vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of premium 
administrative expenses include all other operating costs 
for  our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable 
a h business typically incurs higher acquisition costs relative to other lines  and therefore  our growth in this area has had a negative impact on our policy acquisition cost ratio 
this increasing trend on our policy acquisition costs was offset in by reduced ceding commission at ace tempest re usa 
our policy acquisition cost ratio increased in primarily due to changes in business mix and the favorable impact in of net premiums earned on multi year contracts in connection with the significant catastrophe losses which  generally  did not incur acquisition costs 
our administrative expenses in were stable compared with  despite an adverse impact of foreign exchange 
we continue to focus on reducing expenses where possible 
our administrative expense ratio decreased in  compared with  due to the increase in net premiums earned

table of contents expenses were reduced by the release of an accrual in insurance north american and higher net profits from ace usa s esis claims services operation  which we include in administrative expenses 
our effective income tax rate  which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax  is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates 
a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate 
our effective tax rate on net income was percent in and  compared with percent in we decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million in due primarily to a change in tax regulation 
in  a substantial portion of our catastrophe losses occurred in jurisdictions where we do not incur income tax  causing our income to decline without a commensurate decrease in income tax expense

this change in estimate affected our national accounts workers compensation business principally accident years and a runoff portfolio of workers compensation servicing carrier business covering accident years and prior 
for the national accounts business  the change was principally in our high deductible portfolio 
based on analyses completed during  we have increased our tail factor for allocated loss adjustment expenses alae as well as our ratios of alae to loss used in our projection methodologies 
small movements in these assumptions produce a leveraged increase in the loss estimates across a number of accident years  adverse development on our estimates of ultimate loss on a collection of runoff professional liability and medical programs totaling million 
these increases were the direct result of a review of all open claims that was completed 
table of contents during this claims review identified a number of cases where adverse change in facts and circumstances led to a significant deviation from our estimates of ultimate claim value  favorable development in our estimate of ultimate loss and alae of million in our surety business 
this improvement was heavily concentrated in the and accident years 
in the calendar year  the level of late reported claims and development on known claims for this portfolio was significantly below historical levels for this line of business resulting in a reduction in all loss projection methods  favorable development on our national accounts casualty business  primarily general liability  of million for the accident years 
development on these portfolios continues to be favorable relative to the original assumptions used to price the products 
actual paid and incurred loss activity in has been lower than assumed in our prior projections and we have modified our estimates accordingly  and favorable development of million on our foreign casualty portfolio for the and prior accident years 
this is partly due to an adjustment for a reserve established in for a single large claim  but also due to low levels of reported and paid loss activity on our foreign captive business 
this particular line has net exposure on a per occurrence basis excess of high deductibles self insured retentions and an aggregate basis excess of an aggregate attachment point 
expected loss emergence patterns used in our review projected higher loss development for the and prior accident years than emerged during prompting a reduction in our projection of ultimate losses 
net favorable development of million on short tail business including adverse development totaling million relating to increases in our estimates of loss for the storms primarily in our ace westchester operation but also some modest development in our offshore energy business 
this development was due primarily to a relatively small number of losses on excess policies with large exposed limits 
these losses reached settlement during for amounts in excess of our case reserves prompting adjustments to our projections of ultimate losses 
the claims handling associated with the hurricanes has involved complex and unique causation and coverage issues 
these issues continue to be present and may have a further material adverse impact on our financial results  favorable development of million on ace westchester crop hail business 
this was the direct effect of recording the final settlement of the pool year from the bordereau received during the calendar year  favorable development of million in our workers compensation business due to the absence of multi claimant events such as industrial accidents for the accident year 
the majority of our exposure for these perils falls under our national accounts high deductible line of business 
we evaluate this exposure annually after the accident year has closed allowing for the late identification of significant losses 
our review in of potential accident year losses has led to a decrease in our estimate of the required provision for these claims  favorable development in our estimates of ultimate losses for first party lines including property and auto physical damage in our ace canada operations totaling million  affecting primarily the accident year 
incurred loss development during calendar year on the accident year was lower than historical averages which formed the basis for our prior projections

in  we lengthened the selected tail factors due to an increasing trend observed in industry statistics published in  and a modest deterioration in our claims experience related to the medical cost component of individual claims that emerged since the prior study  
table of contents adverse development of million on the ace bermuda d o book from report years driven by case estimate increases on large claims following significant events in the mediation process during  including increased plaintiff demands  settlement conferences  and court proceedings  favorable development of million on the ace bermuda excess liability book driven by the settlement of a single claim in from the report year on terms more favorable than the assumptions used to establish the reserve

we observed reported claims frequency in lower than anticipated 
net adverse development of million on short tail business including adverse development of million related to property claims arising from catastrophes 
the majority of this increase is related to property losses from hurricane katrina 
the nature and extent of hurricane katrina resulted in some claims that increased over previously reported damage estimates 
factors leading to these increases included demand surge and some impact to previously unimpaired layers of excess coverage  favorable development on ace westchester s crop hail business of million due to recording of the final settlement of the crop results 
in line with normal practice for this type of business  ace did not receive final loss reports for the year until therefore  the prior period movements were direct results of the loss amounts within the initial and final loss reports issued during the first and second quarters of being lower than our preliminary estimates  favorable development of million on ace usa s workers compensation short tail catastrophe and industrial accident exposure arising from and accident years  due to favorable trends in reported loss development 
for the and accident years  claims arising from industrial or travel accidents trended favorably in relative to how earlier accident years had developed at the same period of maturity  and net favorable development of million related to the and accident years 
this favorable activity was primarily in our aerospace and surety lines of business 
both of these businesses are relatively new  in that as recently as our premium volume was minimal and we have grown these businesses significantly since then 
during  we concluded the loss experience had become sufficiently credible  due to the degree of elapsed time  for us to begin to consider loss based projection methods which resulted in favorable prior loss development of million and million  respectively

this favorable prior period development was in response to the annual review of long tail lines completed during the year 
there was million of net favorable development for insurance overseas general on the accident years driven by reductions in loss development method indications and greater credibility being assigned to bornhuetter ferguson projections versus expected loss ratio methods 
this shift in credibility weighting between reserving methods is common practice and allows for greater recognition of actual loss emergence as accident years mature  net favorable development of million as a result of an update of the detailed annual evaluation of the excess exposures in insurance overseas general which comprised strengthening of million in accident years and prior  and million in accident year  and a release of million in accident years and  and adverse development of million in ace global markets long tail professional lines  primarily in years of account this adverse prior period development was largely in response to claims department recommendations on three accounts based on updated information received during the course of claim settlement in calendar year net favorable development of million on short tail lines of business including favorable development of million on short tail property and fire lines primarily in the accident year in ace international 
the favorable development during the past year was due in large part to shifting credibility away from bornhuetter ferguson methods and relying more heavily on loss development patterns as case incurred loss became a more accurate predictor of ultimate loss 
this shift in credibility tended to reduce indicated ultimate losses since  with hindsight  our initial expected loss ratios have proven to be conservative

net investment income in millions of us dollars fixed maturities short term investments equity securities other gross investment income investment expenses net investment income net investment income is influenced by a number of factors  including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows  the level of interest rates  and changes in overall asset allocation 
net investment income increased percent in  compared with  and percent in  compared with the increase in net investment income is primarily due to several years of positive operating cash flows which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base

the following table shows the return on average invested assets for the years ended december    and in millions of us dollars average invested assets net investment income return on average invested assets net realized gains losses we take a long term view with our investment strategy and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk 
the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value 
our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost 
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income through net realized gains losses when securities are sold or when other than temporary impairments are recorded on invested assets 
additionally  net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives  including financial futures  options  swaps  and gmib reinsurance 
changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities  which result from the revaluation of securities held  are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the following table presents our pre tax net realized gains losses for the years ended december    and in millions of us dollars fixed maturities equity securities foreign exchange gains losses other sale of run off reinsurance subsidiaries derivatives equity and fixed income derivatives fair value adjustment on insurance derivatives subtotal derivatives total net realized gains losses subject to investment guidelines approved by our finance and investment committee of the board of directors relating to asset classes  credit quality  and liquidity  our investment managers generally have the ability to sell securities from our available for sale investment portfolio with the concurrence of ace management when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return  considering the realized gain or loss on sale of the held security and differential in future investment income 
often  sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or  for other reasons  market value is apt to deteriorate 
further  we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry 
therefore  securities sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and  thus  the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time 
the interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on securities sales volume but extreme conditions could have an effect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses 
for example  in a declining interest rate environment  the market value of securities increases  resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would  therefore  tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio 
an increasing interest rate environment would tend to have the opposite effect 
the effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income  respectively  in subsequent periods 
from a liquidity perspective  our greatest risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss ie  in a high interest rate environment to meet operating needs and are  thus  unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income refer to liquidity and capital resources for more information 

table of contents in  we recorded net realized losses of million on derivative transactions 
this compares with a net realized loss of million and a net realized gain of million in and  respectively 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity indices on the fair value of derivatives and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions  credit loss experience  and issuer specific developments 
if there is a decline in a security s net realizable value  we must determine whether that decline is temporary or other than temporary 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the book value of the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on our book value 
once a security is identified as having a potential other than temporary impairment  we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period  absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security 
we review all of our fixed maturities and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter 
refer to note e to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for criteria we consider in assessing potential impairment and for a table which summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and our net realized losses in included write downs of million as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude that the decline in fair value was other than temporary 
this compares with write downs of million and million in and  respectively

other income and expense also includes certain excise taxes incurred as a result of capital management initiatives 
these transactions are considered capital in nature and are excluded from underwriting results 
investments our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations 
within this broad liquidity constraint  the purpose of our investment portfolio s structure is to maximize total return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes  credit quality  liquidity  and volatility of expected returns 
our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa  as rated by the independent investment rating service standard and poor s s p 
the portfolio is externally managed by independent  professional investment managers 
the average duration of our fixed income securities  including the effect of options and swaps  was years 
table of contents at december   compared with years at december  we estimate that a basis point bps increase in interest rates would reduce our book value by approximately billion 
our other investments are principally comprised of direct investments  investment funds  and limited partnerships 
our exposure to sub prime asset backed securities was million at december   which represented less than one percent of our investment portfolio 
we do not expect any material investment loss from our exposure to sub prime mortgages 
we hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations in our investment portfolio

for example  without the aaa insurance guarantees  the average rating of this portfolio would fall to aa from aa  which would result in a nominal decline in value 
we would expect a similar market impact from the loss of aaa insurance guarantees on our million in other investments wrapped by financial guarantors

table of contents below investment grade securities in accordance with our investment process  we invest in below investment grade securities through dedicated investment portfolios actively managed by external investment managers that have investment professionals specifically dedicated to this asset class 
at december   our fixed income investment portfolio included below investment grade and non rated securities which  in total  comprised approximately seven percent of our fixed income portfolio 
we define a security as being below investment grade if it has an s p credit rating of bb or less 
our below investment grade and non rated portfolio includes approximately issues  with the top holdings making up approximately percent of the billion balance at december  the greatest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is million 
below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities 
risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below investment grade securities 
below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
we reduce the overall risk in the below investment grade portfolio  as in all investments  through careful credit analysis  strict investment policy guidelines  and diversification by issuer and or guarantor as well as by industry 
restricted assets we are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations 
these requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
we also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of letter of credit loc requirements 
we also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for locs and debt instruments 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
the following table identifies the value of restricted assets at december  and in millions of us dollars deposits with us regulatory authorities deposits with non us regulatory authorities assets used for collateral or guarantees trust funds the value of restricted assets increased percent in compared with  primarily due to an assumed loss portfolio contract written during the first quarter of and the increased use of trust funds in support of us managed business ceded by us insurance entities of ace usa to ace tempest re bermuda

the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify us  primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies 
provisions have been established for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 

table of contents asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a e 
these a e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal  social  and economic environment 
we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a e reserves  which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
our exposure to a e claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased westchester specialty in and the p c business of cigna in  with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the cigna transaction 
in  prior to our acquisition of the p c business of cigna  the pennsylvania insurance commissioner approved a plan to restructure ina financial corporation and its subsidiaries the restructuring which included the division of insurance company of north america ina into two separate corporations an active insurance company that retained the ina name and continued to write p c business and an inactive run off company  now called century indemnity company century 
as a result of the division  predominantly all a e and certain other liabilities of ina were allocated to century and extinguished  as a matter of pennsylvania law  as liabilities of ina 
as part of the restructuring  most a e liabilities of various us affiliates of ina were reinsured to century  and century and certain other run off companies having a e and other liabilities were contributed to brandywine holdings 
as part of the acquisition of the p c business of cigna  we acquired brandywine holdings and its various subsidiaries

the net figures in the above table reflect third party reinsurance other than reinsurance provided by nico under three aggregate excess of loss contracts described below collectively  the nico contracts 
we exclude the nico contracts as they cover non a e liabilities as well as a e liabilities 
the split of coverage provided under the nico contracts for a e liabilities as compared to non a e liabilities is entirely dependant on the timing of the payment of the related claims 
our ability to make an estimate of this split is not practicable 
we believe  instead  that the a e discussion is best provided excluding the nico contracts  while separately discussing the nico contracts in relation to the total subject business  both a e and non a e  covered by those contracts

an internal review was also conducted during for our consolidated a e liabilities as of june  for that review  we concluded that our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  were adequate and  therefore  no change to the carried net reserve was required  while the gross loss reserves increased by approximately million 
in  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century 
this external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an external actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years

table of contents reserving considerations for asbestos  we face claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers  distributors  installers  and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos 
claims can be filed by individual claimants or groups of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time 
claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured 
environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution 
it is common  especially for larger defendants  to be named as a potentially responsible party prp at multiple sites 
our environmental claim count definition is based on policyholder by site numbers 
for example  if a policyholder were named as a prp at pollution sites  we would track this as claim counts 
in addition  should we have multiple policyholders identified as prp s at the same waste site  each would constitute a separate claim count 
the table below summarizes count information for asbestos and environmental claims for the years ended december  and  for direct policies only  and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance 
asbestos by causative agent open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year environmental by site open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year in  the number of newly reported asbestos claims rose nine percent to  compared with new claims in the total pending asbestos claims decreased percent to  at december   compared with  at december  this decrease in pending claims is influenced by the number of closings during the period 
this decrease in claims was attributable  in part  to the formal closing of files that had been inactive for some time 
a review of the inactive files revealed that payment was no longer sought on the files  therefore  the files were closed 
in  the number of newly reported environmental claims continued the decline experienced in recent years 
the number of new sites in declined six percent to  compared with in total pending environmental claims at december   declined percent to  compared with  at december  this decrease in claims was attributable  in part  to the formal closing of files that had been inactive for some time 
a review of the inactive files revealed that payment was no longer sought on the files  therefore  the files were closed 
the following table shows our gross and net survival ratios for our a e loss reserves and alae reserves at december  survival ratios survival ratios year year year year gross net gross net gross net gross net asbestos environmental total the net ratios reflect third party reinsurance other than the aggregate excess reinsurance provided under the nico contracts 
these survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and alae reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years year survival ratio  and by asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments in year survival ratio 
the survival ratios provide only a very rough measure of reserve adequacy and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices  variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims and levels of coverage provided 
we  therefore  
table of contents urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy and note that the year survival ratios  particularly  are likely to move considerably from year to year for the reasons just described 
three year gross and net survival ratios remained relatively consistent with the comparable three year ratios at december  the year net survival ratio for asbestos increased to from in the net year survival ratio for asbestos was adversely affected by a favorable settlement that resulted in a full buyback of policy obligations on a significant account that resulted in a large increase in payments for the year 
brandywine run off entities in addition to housing a significant portion of our a e exposure  the brandywine operations include run off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses 
the following companies comprise ace s brandywine operations century a pennsylvania insurer  century re a pennsylvania insurer  and century international reinsurance company ltd 
a bermuda insurer circ 
all of the brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of brandywine holdings 
the us based ace ina companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the brandywine operations in connection with the restructuring a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement 
in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  ina financial corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund the dividend retention fund consisting of million plus investment earnings 
the full balance of the dividend retention fund was contributed to century as of december  to the extent future dividends are paid by ina holdings corporation to its parent  ina financial corporation  and to the extent ina financial corporation then pays such dividends to ina corporation  a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the dividend retention fund to million within five years 
in   and  no such dividends were paid and  therefore  no replenishment of the dividend retention fund occurred 
the obligation to maintain and to replenish the dividend retention fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid is ongoing until ace ina receives prior written approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner to terminate the fund 
in addition  an ace ina insurance subsidiary provided reinsurance coverage to century in the amount of million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement the aggregate excess of loss agreement if the statutory capital and surplus of century falls below million or if century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due  after giving effect to the contribution of the balance  if any  of the dividend retention fund 
coverage under the aggregate excess of loss agreement was triggered as of december   following contribution of the balance of the dividend retention fund  because century s capital and surplus fell below million at december  effective december   ace ina holdings contributed million to century in exchange for a surplus note 
after giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note  the statutory surplus of century at december   was million and approximately million in statutory basis losses were ceded to the aggregate excess of loss agreement 
century reports the amount ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles  which differ from gaap by  among other things  allowing century to discount its asbestos and environmental reserves 
for gaap reporting purposes  intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the aggregate excess of loss agreement are eliminated upon consolidation 
to estimate ace s remaining claim exposure under the aggregate excess of loss agreement on a gaap basis  we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves and we adjust the statutory provision for uncollectible reinsurance to a gaap basis amount 
at december   approximately million in gaap basis losses were ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement  leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately million 
at december   the remaining limit of coverage under the agreement was million 
while we believe ace has no legal obligation to fund losses above the aggregate excess of loss agreement limit of coverage  ace s consolidated results would nevertheless continue to include any losses above the limit of coverage for so long as the brandywine companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ace 
uncertainties relating to ace s ultimate brandywine exposure in addition to the dividend retention fund and aggregate excess of loss agreement commitments described above  certain ace entities are primarily liable for asbestos  environmental  and other exposures that they have reinsured to century 
accordingly  if century were to become insolvent and ace were to lose control of century  some or all of the recoverables due to these ace companies from century could become uncollectible  yet those ace entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds 
under such circumstances  ace would recognize a loss in its consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ace companies to century were approximately billion 
at december   century s carried gross reserves including reserves ceded by the active ace companies to century were billion 
we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables  which relate to 
table of contents liabilities payable over many years ie  years or more  are not impaired at this time 
a substantial portion of the liabilities ceded to century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by century to nico and  as of december   approximately billion of cover remains on a paid basis 
should century s loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation  the reinsurance recoverables due from century to its affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities  including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities 
thus  the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables 
as of december   losses ceded by century to the active ace companies and other amounts owed to century by the active ace companies were approximately million in the aggregate 
sale of certain brandywine companies refer to note i to the consolidated financial statements  under item catastrophe management we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe accumulation around the world and have significantly reduced our us wind exposure since our modeled annual aggregate in year return period us hurricane probable maximum loss  net of reinsurance is approximately million  ie  there is a one percent chance that ace s losses incurred in any year from us hurricanes could be in excess of million or less than six percent of our total shareholders equity at december  
we estimate that at such loss levels  aggregate industry losses are approximately billion 
if the hurricanes were to recur  our net losses on an as if basis would be percent lower 
ace s modeled losses reflect our in force portfolio and catastrophe reinsurance program as of october  the modeling estimates of both ace and industry loss levels are inherently uncertain owing to key assumptions 
first  while the use of third party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate hurricane losses is prevalent within the insurance industry  the models are reliant upon significant meteorology and engineering assumptions to estimate hurricane losses 
in particular  modeled hurricane events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential 
second  there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of the modeling software 
third  we are reliant upon third party estimates of industry insured exposures and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between ace s loss and that of the industry following an event 
fourth  we assume that our reinsurance recoveries following an event are fully collectible 
these loss estimates do not represent ace s potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that ace s actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates 
natural catastrophe reinsurance program ace s core catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary operations ie  excluding assumed reinsurance and consists of two separate towers 
first  for losses arising out of north america  our core traditional program renewed on january   and we purchased million part of million excess of million in coverage and we purchased million part of million excess of million in coverage 
we also purchased million part of million excess of million retention 
the combined effect of our traditional program purchase is that we have percent of million excess of million in coverage placed and we have percent of million excess of million layer placed 
in addition  we have purchased a reinsurance treaty that provides million part of million in coverage for us property perils other than us wind excess of million 
this cover essentially replaces a swap agreement that was effective at january   and provided us certain earthquake protection 
each program noted above has a single reinstatement available 
in addition to the foregoing  we have in place a multi year  peril specific program from a major reinsurer that is backed by their credit worthiness and the issuance of fully collateralized catastrophe bonds 
under this multi year coverage  we have million of us hurricane coverage in excess of million attachment point 
in addition  we have purchased us earthquake coverage with a territorial scope of california  the pacific northwest  and the central us this cover is percent of million of loss incurred in excess of million attachment point 
finally  we also purchased a combined us earthquake covering the three territories noted above and us hurricane top layer cover of million part of million of loss incurred in excess of an million attachment point 
these multi year programs do not have a reinstatement feature 
to keep the expected loss the same each year of these multi year covers  the attachment point is adjusted annually  either up or down  based upon an independent modeling firm s review of the exposure data underlying each program 
as noted above  we did not renew the swap agreement and instead purchased a like amount of coverage in the traditional reinsurance marketplace 
by way of comparison  the program has potentially approximately million less in coverage for us hurricane and cal 
table of contents ifornia earthquake than the expiring program 
we consider our effective retention to be approximately million but this will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other coverages purchased by individual business units 
second  for losses arising outside of north america and effective july   our core program is made up of two layers 
we have protection of million from a single catastrophic event in excess of the retention of million with two reinstatements 
in addition  we have another layer that provides million in protection excess of million with one reinstatement 
there is further protection above this core program for specific geographic regions  being million excess of million for asia pacific and million excess of million for europe 
each of these top layers has a single reinstatement 
in addition  there are various underlying per risk and catastrophe treaties underlying the core program s retention of million 
in comparison to the prior year  the core program and the specific layer for asia pacific were each reduced by million  and the europe specific layer was increased by million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
as a holding company  ace limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments 
in addition to net investment income  our cash flows currently depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments 
historically  these dividends and other payments have come from ace s bermuda based operating subsidiaries  which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries 
as an insurance company  one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims 
we expect that positive cash flows from operations underwriting activities and investment income will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims  we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintain available credit facilities refer to the section entitled credit facilities below 
in addition  for certain insurance  reinsurance  or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows  we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities 
with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio  we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments 
in a low interest rate environment  the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment  such durations tend to be longer 
given the current low rate environment  at december   the average duration of our fixed maturity investments years is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities years 
despite our safeguards  if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows  we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing 
potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses as a result of coverage disputes  reinsurers credit problems or  decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables 
additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund loss payments were sold at depressed prices 
because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ace group of companies  the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level 
as a result  the probability of a liquidity strain  as described above  may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis 
if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary  we could liquidate a portion of the portfolio as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations 
the payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction  as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations  including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies  which are discussed below 
during  we were able to meet all of our obligations  including the payment of dividends declared on our ordinary shares and preferred shares  with our net cash flows and dividends received 
should the need arise  we generally have access to the capital markets and other available credit facilities 
we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors 
considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision 
the legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid in capital of each of the bermuda subsidiaries 
in  ace bermuda declared and paid 
table of contents dividends of million 
during  ace bermuda and ace tempest life reinsurance declared and paid dividends of million and million  respectively 
we expect that a majority of our cash inflows in will be from our bermuda subsidiaries 
the payment of any dividends from ace global markets or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable uk insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  the release of funds by syndicate to subsidiaries of ace global markets is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd s 
ace ina s us insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends  without prior regulatory approval  subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary s domicile or  if applicable  commercial domicile 
ace ina s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities 
ace limited did not receive any dividends from ace global markets or ace ina in and the debt issued by ace ina to provide partial financing for the ace ina acquisition and for other operating needs is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina s insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources 
our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written  net investment income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
funds are used primarily to pay claims  operating expenses  and dividends and to service debt and purchase investments 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested 
our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time claims are paid 
generally  cash flows are affected by claim payments that  due to the nature of our operations  may be comprised of large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods 
refer to contractual obligations and commitments for our estimate for future claim payments by period 
sources of liquidity include cash from operations  routine sales of investments  and financing arrangements 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were billion in  compared with billion in these amounts reflect net income for each period  adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
net income increased to billion in  compared with billion in for  significant adjustments included increases in unpaid losses and loss expenses and unearned premiums of million due to growth in our a h line and a decrease in reinsurance recoverable of million 
net cash flows from operating activities in were negatively impacted by increased catastrophe loss payments 
our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities were billion in  compared with billion in for the indicated periods  net cash flows used for investing activities were related principally to net purchases of fixed maturities 
the year included the impact of the sale of the run off companies which reduced cash and investments by approximately million 
our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were million in  compared with million in net cash flows used for financing activities in were primarily comprised of dividends paid on ordinary shares  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of options for ordinary shares 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels  and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us  and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
we believe that our cash balances  cash flow from operations  routine sales of investments  and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities  as discussed below  are adequate to meet expected cash requirements 
as discussed under long term debt  below  we have issued debt and secured lender commitments totaling approximately million in connection with our agreement to purchase combined 
we expect the balance of the approximately billion purchase price billion to be funded using internally generated resources 
in order to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency  in  we entered into agreements with a bank provider to implement two international multi currency notional cash pooling programs 
in each program  participating ace entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider and each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency us dollars and then notionally pooled 
the bank extends overdraft credit to any participating ace entity as needed  provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end 
table of contents of each day is at least zero 
actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not co mingled between legal entities 
ace entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short term timing mismatches  and any overdraft balances incurred under this program by an ace entity would be guaranteed by ace limited up to million in the aggregate 
the dedicated credit facility previously available to ace limited was cancelled in november  following the completion of the renewed revolving credit facility discussed below  which was amended to allow same day draw downs for both programs 
ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength insurance ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies  including s p  am best  moody s investors service  and fitch 
the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies 
our internet site  www 
acelimited 
com  also contains some information about our ratings  which can be found under the investor information tab 
financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of a company s claims paying ability 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities 
debt ratings apply to short term and long term debt as well as preferred stock 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal  interest  and preferred stock dividends 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings 
if one or more of our ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed  or available to be deployed  to support our business operations 
the following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at december  and in millions of us dollars short term debt long term debt total debt trust preferred securities preferred shares ordinary shareholders equity total shareholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization ratio of debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions and our perceived financial strength 
we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time 
short term debt short term debt at december   consisted of aud million million of percent senior notes due december  million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due october classified under long term debt at december  and million owed to brokers under a securities repurchase agreement 
in april  we repaid million of indebtedness 
during  we executed a securities repurchase agreement with a counterparty 
under this repurchase agreement  we agreed to sell securities and repurchase them at a date in the future for a predetermined price 

table of contents long term debt our total long term debt of billion is described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  under item in february  we issued  at a small discount  million of percent senior notes due we used the net proceeds from this issuance together with available cash to repay million of indebtedness which matured in april classified as short term debt at december  
in connection with our agreement to purchase combined  in february  we issued  at a slight discount  million of percent notes that mature in we have lender commitments for us to borrow million in a five year private transaction with a bank syndicate at a fixed rate of approximately percent 
the borrowing is contingent on the closing of the acquisition of combined 
we plan to use the net proceeds from both the bank loan and public issuance to pay a portion of the purchase price of combined 
the following instruments have specific collateral triggers 
in  ace us holdings issued million of unsecured senior notes that mature october in december  ace ina issued million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature december  we repaid million of this outstanding amount during we have a million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances 
the minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is million 
the actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged 
under these transactions  we would be required to provide collateral of million if s p downgraded our debt rating to bb or lower or downgraded ace bermuda s financial strength rating to bbb or lower 
although there can be no assurance  we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur 
in the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely  we would be liable for certain transaction costs 
the counter party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non performance 
trust preferred securities the securities outstanding consist of million of trust preferred securities due  issued by a special purpose entity a trust that is wholly owned by us 
the sole assets of the special purpose entities are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries 
the special purpose entity looks to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities 
we have guaranteed the payments on these debt instruments 
the trustees of the trust include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee  such as a trust company 
our officers serving as trustees of the trust do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity 
the full million of outstanding trust preferred securities calculated as million as discussed above plus our equity share of the trust is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  under item ordinary shares total shareholders equity increased billion in  primarily due to net income of billion which was partially offset by dividends declared 
our ratios of debt to total capitalization and debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization have decreased due to the increase in shareholders equity and stable debt and trust preferred securities 
as part of our capital management program  in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of any ace issued debt or capital securities including ordinary shares  up to million 
at december   this authorization had not been utilized 
we generally maintain shelf capacity at all times in order to allow capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen capital needs 
our unlimited shelf registration expires in december on january   and april   we paid dividends of cents per ordinary share to shareholders of record on december   and march   respectively 
on july   october   and january   we paid dividends of cents per share to shareholders of record on june   september   and december   respectively 
we have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in however  the declaration  payment  and value of future dividends on ordinary shares is at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements  and other factors including legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
dividends on the preferred shares are payable quarterly when  and if  declared by our board of directors  in arrears on march  june  september  and december of each year 
we paid dividends of per preferred share on march   june   september   and

contractual obligations and commitments the table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period at december  payments due by period in millions of us dollars total less than year years years after years payment amounts determinable from the respective contracts deposit liabilities purchase obligations limited partnerships funding commitments operating leases short term debt long term debt trust preferred securities interest on debt obligations total obligations in which payment amounts are determinable from the respective contracts payment amounts not determinable from the respective contracts estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits total contractual obligations and commitments the above table excludes the following items pension obligations minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial over the next year 
subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
preferred shares our preferred shares  issued in  have no fixed repayment terms 
we may redeem the preferred shares at any time after may   at a redemption value of per depository share each of which represent one tenth of one preferred share or at any time under certain limited circumstances 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in accordance with issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the fin liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million at december  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement with respect to these liabilities 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above 
deposit liabilities deposit liabilities include reinsurance deposit liabilities of million and million and contract holder deposit funds of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the reinsurance deposit liabilities arise from contracts we sold for which there is not a significant transfer of risk 
at contract inception  the deposit liability is equal to net cash we received 
an accretion rate is established based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the term of the contract 
the deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations 
we periodically reassess the estimated ultimate liability and related expected rate of return 
any resulting changes to the amount of the deposit liability are reflected as an adjustment to earnings to reflect the cumulative effect of the period the contract has been in force  and by an adjustment to the future accretion rate of the liability over the remaining estimated contract term 

table of contents additional information with respect to deposit liabilities is contained in note k to the consolidated financial statements  under item purchase obligations we are party to enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase certain services 
purchase obligations in the table primarily comprise audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services 
limited partnerships funding commitments in connection with our investments in limited partnerships  we have commitments that may require funding of up to million over the next several years 
the timing of the payment of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from our estimated timing in the table 
operating lease commitments we lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through december we renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required 
estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts 
such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p c insurance and reinsurance company 
in contrast to other contractual obligations  cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract 
for example  we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts ie  when a loss event has not occurred and if a payment is to be made  the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract 
in the table above  we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and do not take reinsurance recoverables into account 
these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above  differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates 
estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts including  but not limited to  guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs and gmibs 
the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts 
the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and  with respect to gmib reinsurance  reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts  and with respect to gmdb reinsurance  does not consider benefit payments related to future fees or premiums not recognized through the balance sheet date 
accordingly  the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet 
payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments  actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table 
credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the us  the terms of certain us insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide locs to clients 
in addition  ace global markets is required to satisfy certain us regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of locs 
locs may also be used for general corporate purposes and for funds at lloyd s

these facilities are issued in the name of ace european group limited  lloyd s syndicate  and century indemnity reinsurance company 
supports ace global markets underwriting capacity for lloyd s syndicate in november  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november this facility is available for general corporate purposes and the issuance of locs and replaced the existing million revolving credit facility 
on the effective date of the new revolving credit facility  all outstanding locs issued under the replaced facility were deemed to have been issued under the new revolving credit facility and the replaced facility terminated 
in november  we entered into a billion unsecured operational loc facility expiring in november this facility replaced two loc facilities permitting up to billion of locs 
on the effective date of the new loc facility  all outstanding locs issued under the replaced facilities were deemed to have been issued under the new loc facility and the replaced facilities terminated 
in june  syndicate reduced the loc balance supporting its funds at lloyd s in line with the requirements promulgated by lloyd s 
the associated facility amount was also reduced to million 
in november  we gained approval from our bank group to extend the term of the facility by one year to satisfy syndicate s funding requirements through locs issued under this facility will expire no earlier than december with the exception of the loc facilities noted under other  the facilities in the table above require that we maintain certain covenants  all of which have been met at december  these covenants include but are not limited to i maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth in an amount not less than the minimum amount 
for the purpose of this calculation  the minimum amount is an amount equal to the sum of the base amount currently billion plus percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  ending after the date on which the current base amount became effective  plus percent of any increase in consolidated net worth during the same period  attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares 
the minimum amount is subject to an annual reset provision 
ii maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than to under this covenant  debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity  except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than percent 
in this circumstance  the amount greater than percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   a the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in i above was billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was billion and b our ratio of debt to total capitalization was to in addition to these covenants  the ace global markets capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ace falls to s p bbb or lower 
our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would  subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants  result in an event of default 
this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility 
a failure by ace limited or any of its subsidiaries to pay an obligation due for an amount exceeding million would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
further  through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives through our approximately percent ownership of assured guaranty ltd 
and gmib and gmdb products  we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets  decreases in interest rates  and declines in the equity markets 
our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities  denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our fixed income and all of our equity securities are classified as available for sale and  as such  changes in interest rates  equity prices  or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
nevertheless  changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when  and if  a security is sold or impaired 
from time to time  we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures  options  swaps  and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market 
in addition  as part of our investing activity  we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities tbas 
these instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security prices 
changes in the fair value of tbas are included in net realized gains losses and therefore have an immediate effect on both our net income and shareholders equity 
at december  and  our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was billion 
we seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques  including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk fixed income portfolio and debt obligations our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations have exposure to interest rate risk 
changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations 
we monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions 
the following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio of an increase in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of fixed income portfolio pre tax impact of bps increase in interest rates percentage of total fixed income portfolio at fair value changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
although our debt  preferred shares  and trust preferred securities collectively referred to as debt obligations are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value  albeit there is no immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following table shows the impact on the market value of our debt obligations of a decrease in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and 
table of contents in millions of us dollars fair value of debt obligations impact of bps decrease in interest rates percentage of total debt obligations at fair value variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables 
equity price risk equity portfolio our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in addition  we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments  which also have exposure to price risk 
our us equity portfolio is correlated with the s p index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio 
our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non us equity markets 
the following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at december  and millions of us dollars fair value of equity securities pre tax impact of percent decline in market prices for equity exposures changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation depreciation and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non us companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies 
therefore  foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process 
locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling  the euro  and the canadian dollar 
the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december  and millions of us dollars fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies percentage of fair value of total net assets pre tax impact on equity of hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees  primarily gmdb and gmib 
these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense  which is included in life underwriting income 
in addition  our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability  which is classified as a derivative according to fas the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the difference between the fair value of the contract and the sop reserves 
changes in the fair value of the gmib liability  net of associated changes in the calculated sop reserve  are reflected as realized gains or losses 
the sop reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors  the most significant of which are equity levels  interest rate levels  and implied equity volatilities 
the table below shows the sensitivity  as of december   of the sop reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
note that the change in the fair value liability includes offsetting changes in the fair value of specific derivative instruments held to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment 

table of contents in millions of us dollars worldwide equity decrease impact of bp decrease in interest rates long term equity implied volatility up increase in sop reserves reduction in life underwriting income increase in fair value liability reduction in net income the table above demonstrates  for example  that a percent decrease in worldwide equities would reduce our life underwriting income by million and cause a net realized loss of million  for a total reduction in net income of million 
it should be noted that these sensitivities are not directly additive  because changes in one factor will affect the sensitivity to changes in other factors and also  that the sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors 
the calculation of the sop reserve and fair value liability is based on internal models that include assumptions regarding future policyholder behavior  including withdrawal  annuitization  and asset allocation 
these assumptions impact both the absolute level of the sop reserve and fair value liability as well as the sensitivities to changes in market factors shown above 
ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance  with the probability of long term economic loss relatively small 
in the short run  adverse changes in market factors will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income 
when evaluating these risks  we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long term economic net loss  as well as the short term accounting variations caused by these market movements 
therefore  we evaluate this business in terms of its long term economic risk reward 
the ultimate risk is a long term underperformance of investment returns  which can be exacerbated by a long term reduction in interest rates 
in the short run  adverse market movements of the magnitude shown above do not translate immediately into a large increase in paid claims 
in addition  while they do increase the probability of suffering long term economic loss  the probability is still small 
following a market downturn  continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization 
however  if market conditions improved following a downturn  sop reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims  which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income 
from inception july to december   the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio has produced the following cumulative results  along with returns on equity in excess of percent 
any increase in sop reserves and fair value liability should be taken in context of these results net premiums earned million claims paid million sop reserves held at december  million fair value gmib liability held at december  million life underwriting income million net income million
