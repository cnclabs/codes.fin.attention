item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a worldwide developer  producer  and marketer of chemical specialty products and a provider of chemical management services cms for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications around the globe with significant sales to the steel and automotive industries 
the revenue growth in was due to higher volumes  particularly in china and europe  and increased selling prices 
cms revenues were also higher due to the renewal and restructuring of several of the company s contracts throughout the year 
higher selling prices  combined with improved cms profitability  helped offset higher raw material and third party finished product costs  resulting in significantly higher gross margin dollars but with a slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales as compared to raw material costs continued to be higher as compared to the prior year and continued to steadily rise throughout the year 
factors impacting higher selling  general and administrative costs in include continued expansion into asia pacific  higher commissions related to higher sales  higher incentive compensation as a result of higher earnings  higher legal and environmental costs  foreign exchange rate translation  as well as inflationary increases 
the full year results included some unusual items as well 
a million environmental charge was taken related to the settlement of environmental litigation involving ac products  inc acp  a wholly owned subsidiary of quaker  as well as additional costs for the estimated future remediation costs 
a million charge related to a discontinued strategic initiative and a million charge related to certain customer bankruptcies were also taken 
the effective tax rate includes a million refund of taxes in china as a result of the company s increased investment and a non cash out of period tax benefit adjustment of million related to certain deferred tax items  as well as a million charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a tax law change 
the net result was a considerable improvement in earnings per diluted share of for  compared to for notwithstanding the company s improved performance  the continued strength of the business environment is subject to limited visibility due to continued raw material price volatility and an uncertain global economic environment 
with crude oil near per barrel and animal fats and vegetable oils impacted by increased biodiesel consumption  raw material prices continue to be a challenge 
any improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales will depend in part upon a sustained period of stable or declining raw material costs 
while demand is generally expected to remain stable  volume in certain markets was limited by customer end market issues  including reduced vehicle sales experienced by some automotive customers and reduced steel demand  particularly in the us with the settlement of the acp environmental litigation  legal and environmental costs are expected to decline in the future 
the company will remain focused on pursuing revenue opportunities  managing its raw material and other costs  and pursuing pricing initiatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans including equity based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulties 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally established at of the amount outstanding at the filing date  dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of three investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents tax exposures  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  fin applies to all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
fin prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
fin also requires that the amount of interest expense and income to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with fin  including timing differences  and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis over the life of the intangible asset based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the sfas no 
impairment

further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required

liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase resulted primarily from million of cash provided by operating activities  offset in part by  million of cash used in investing activities and million of cash used in financing activities 
the million of cash provided by operating activities is the highest level the company has achieved in recent history 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  compared to million in the increased cash flow was largely due to lower working capital requirements in compared to despite an million sales increase  higher raw material costs  and increased business from our cms channel  all of which typically require incremental investments in working capital  the company has made significant progress around the globe in limiting the pace of such increased investment 
in addition  the company s higher net income  higher depreciation  and the completion of all restructuring activities were also significant factors in the increased cash flow from operating activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in the decreased use of cash was primarily due to lower capital expenditures as a result of reduced capital expansion and replacement activities in north america  europe and asia pacific 
also contributing to the decreased use of cash was higher cash inflow from the company s below described restricted cash relating to asbestos costs of an inactive subsidiary of the company 
this cash inflow is equally offset as an outflow of cash in cash flows from operating activities as the inactive subsidiary makes payments for claims and costs of defense in accordance with the settlement and release agreements 
also  contributing to the change in investing cash flows are higher payments related to acquisitions in in the first quarter of  the company made the second of four annual payments of million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in its brazilian joint venture 
in the second quarter of  the company s q technologies joint venture acquired the oil and gas field chemical business of frontier research and chemicals  inc  for million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made the second payment related to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in its china joint venture for million 
in january  the company contributed its conshohocken  pennsylvania property and buildings the site into a real estate joint venture the venture in exchange for a interest in the venture 
the venture did not assume any debt or other obligations of the company and the company did not guarantee nor was it obligated to pay any principal  interest or penalties on any of the venture s indebtedness 
the venture renovated certain of the existing buildings at the site  as well as built new office space 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the venture to lease approximately of the site s available office space for a year period commencing february  with multiple renewal options 
the company believes the terms of this lease were no less favorable than the terms it would have obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
in february  the venture sold its real estate assets to an unrelated third party  which resulted in million of proceeds to the company after payment of the venture s obligations 
the proceeds include a gain of million related to the sale by the venture of its real estate holdings as well as million of preferred distributions 
in the first quarter of  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the payments are structured to be received over a four year period with annual installments of million  the first 
table of contents of which was received in the second quarter of the subsequent installments are contingent upon whether or not federal asbestos legislation is adopted by the due date of each annual installment 
if federal asbestos legislation is so enacted  and requires the carrier to contribute into a trust or similar vehicle as a result of the policies issued to the subsidiary  then the insurance carrier s obligation to make the subsequent installments will be cancelled 
during the third quarter of  the same inactive subsidiary and one of its insurance carriers entered into a claim handling and funding agreement  under which the carrier will pay of the defense and indemnity costs incurred by or on behalf of the subsidiary in connection with asbestos bodily injury claims for a minimum of five years beginning july  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million of cash provided by financing activities for the change was caused primarily by borrowings in the prior year used to fund the company s working capital needs  as well as the restructuring activities taken in the fourth quarter of  compared to net repayments in on strong operating cash flow results 
in  the company experienced a high level of stock option exercises compared to the prior year  which contributed to the change in net cash flows from financing activities 
acp entered into a settlement agreement with the orange county water district  effective october   relating to environmental litigation initiated in late in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million charge to cover a payment of million in settlement of the litigation  and million of increased reserves for its future expenditures for soil and water remediation program 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
on august   quaker and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a second amendment to the syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and letter of credit issuer  and certain other financial institutions as lenders 
the amendment increases the maximum principal amount available for revolving credit borrowings from million to million  which can be increased to million at the company s option if lenders agree to increase their commitments and the company satisfies certain conditions 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the credit facility from to in general  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or libor rate plus a margin based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
in february  the company completed a refinancing of its existing industrial development bonds to fix the interest rate on an additional million of debt 
the provisions of the agreements require that the company maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  and under its most restrictive covenants  the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding on these credit lines at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt and mitigate the risks associated with higher interest rates 
the combined notional value of the swaps was million at december  the company had a net debt to total capital ratio of at december   compared to at december  in connection with the first quarter adoption of fin  the company recorded a non cash charge to shareholders equity of million  which negatively impacted the company s net debt to total capital ratio by approximately one percentage point 
at december   the company s gross fin liability  including accrued interest and penalties  was million 
the company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its fin liability 
however  should the fin liability be paid  the amount of the payment may be reduced by million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions 
the company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements  including pension plan contributions  payment of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisitions and business opportunities  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt as needed 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are excluded as the majority of the company s debt is subject to variable interest rates 
amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements total contractual cash obligations operations cms discussion in  the company began entering into new contracts under which it receives a set management fee and the costs that relate to those management fees were and are largely dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
this approach came with new risks and opportunities  as the profit earned from the management fee is subject to movements in product costs as well as the company s own performance 
the company believes this expanded approach is a way for quaker to become an integral part of our customers operational efforts to improve manufacturing costs and to demonstrate value that the company would not be able to demonstrate as purely a product provider 
consistent with the foregoing approach  the company was awarded a series of multi year cms contracts  primarily at general motors powertrain  chrysler and ford manufacturing sites over the last several years 
this business was an important step in building the company s share and leadership position in the automotive process fluids market and has positioned the company well for penetration of cms opportunities in other metalworking manufacturing sites 
this alternative approach had a dramatic impact on the company s revenue and margins 
under the traditional cms approach  where the company effectively acts as an agent  revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
the alternative structure is different in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
as a result  the company recognizes in the alternative structure in reported revenues the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
as some contracts have been renewed or renegotiated  some of the contracts have reverted to a pass through basis  while others have remained on a gross basis 
currently  the company has a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and fixed priced contracts covering all services and products 
the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms depending on customer requirements and business circumstances 

table of contents comparison of with net sales for were million  up from million for the increase in net sales was attributable to a combination of higher sales prices and volume growth 
volume growth was realized across all regions with strong gains in both asia pacific and europe  as well as higher revenue related to the company s cms channel 
foreign exchange rate translation increased revenues by approximately for compared to selling price increases were realized across all regions and market segments  in part as an ongoing effort to offset higher raw material costs 
cms revenues were higher due to additional cms accounts  as well as the renewal and restructuring pass through to gross of several of the company s cms contracts 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold in dollar terms was higher by more than million  or  consistent with the increased sales 
higher selling prices and a stronger performance from the company s cms channel helped improve gross profit in dollar terms  while higher raw material costs and sales mix resulted in a slightly lower gross profit percentage 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  as compared to for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for increased million compared to foreign exchange rate translation accounted for approximately million of the increase over the prior year 
also negatively affecting the comparison with the prior year was a pension gain of million recorded in the first quarter of  due to a legislative change 
the remainder of the increase was due to continued planned spending in higher growth areas  including china  higher incentive compensation as a result of higher earnings  higher commissions as a result of higher sales  higher legal and environmental costs  and inflationary increases 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a discontinued strategic initiative and a million charge related to certain customer bankruptcies 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded environmental charges of million as disclosed in its press release dated october  the charges consisted of million related to the settlement of environmental litigation involving ac products  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  as well as an additional million charge for the estimated future remediation costs 
the increase in other income was primarily due to foreign exchange gains recorded in  compared to losses in the prior year 
the increase in net interest expense was attributable to higher average borrowings and higher interest rates 
the company s effective tax rate was for  compared to in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate includes a higher refund of taxes in china as a result of the company s increased investment with million received in versus million received in in addition  the lower effective tax rate includes a non cash out of period tax benefit adjustment of million related to certain deferred tax items 
the effective tax rate was also affected by a changing mix of income among tax jurisdictions as well as the company s first quarter adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
at the end of  the company had net us deferred tax assets totaling million  excluding deferred tax assets relating to additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination was made  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the continued price pressure in the company s raw materials has been negatively impacting profitability in certain taxing jurisdictions 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact taxable income in these jurisdictions

other major risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september   each of which is discussed in greater detail in item a of this report 
furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results

this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates 
table of contents rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
in and  the company entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and million and a fair value of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
in february  the company completed a refinancing of its existing industrial development bonds to fix the interest rate of an additional million of debt 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location  as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
