item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth in item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
general novadel pharma inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing oral spray formulations for a broad range of marketed drugs 
our proprietary technology offers  in comparison to conventional oral dosage forms  the potential for faster absorption of drugs into the bloodstream leading to quicker onset of therapeutic effects and possibly lower doses 
oral sprays eliminate the requirement for water or the need to swallow  potentially improving patient convenience and compliance 
our oral spray technology is focused on addressing unmet medical needs for a broad array of existing and future pharmaceutical products 
our most advanced oral spray candidates target angina  nausea  insomnia  migraine headaches and disorders of the central nervous system 
we plan to develop these and other products independently and through collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
currently  we have eight patents which have been issued in the us and patents which have been issued outside of the us additionally  we have over patents pending around the world 
we look for drug compounds that are off patent or are coming off patent in the near future  and we formulate these compounds in conjunction with our proprietary drug delivery method 
once formulated  we file for new patent applications on these formulated compounds that comprise our product candidates 
our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to the pharmaceutical formulations  methods of use and methods of manufacturing for our product candidates 
we have had a history of recurring losses  giving rise to an accumulated deficit as of december  of  as compared to  as of december  we have had negative cash flow from operating activities of  for the year ended december    for the five months ended december    for the fiscal year ended july   and  for the fiscal year ended july  as of december   we had working capital of  as compared to  as of december   representing a net decrease in working capital of approximately  during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
despite this reduction in expenditures for clinical activities  we require capital to sustain our existing organization until such time as clinical activities can be resumed 
given the current level of spending  we estimate that we will have sufficient cash on hand to fund operations through the middle of the second calendar quarter  funding for the company s future development activities could be secured through new strategic partnerships and or the sale of our common stock or other securities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us in a timely manner or on favorable terms  if at all 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to our attempt to complete a financing or strategic partnering arrangement that are outside our control 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unsuccessful at obtaining additional financing as needed  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease operations 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we achieve profitability  if ever 
our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   were prepared under the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern 
we were incorporated in  and do not have a history of earnings 
as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit report has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
continued operations are dependent on our ability to complete equity or debt formation activities or to generate profitable operations 
such capital formation activities may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
if we cannot continue as a viable entity  our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the company 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from consulting activities  primarily in connection with product development for various pharmaceutical companies 
more recently  we have begun to derive revenues from license fees and milestone payments stemming from our partnership agreements 
our future growth and profitability will be principally dependent upon our ability to successfully develop our products and to market and distribute the final products either internally or with the assistance of a strategic partner 
on june   our board of directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from july to december accordingly  our new fiscal year begins on january and ends on december we filed a transition report on form k for the five months ended december  as such  the end of the quarters in the new fiscal year does not coincide with the end of the quarters in the previous fiscal years 
due to the significant costs  the company is not recasting the quarterly data from the previous fiscal year as such costs would exceed any potential benefits 
instead  the company is presenting financial statements and other financial information  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the years ended december   the five months ended december   and the fiscal years ended july  and july  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the year ended december  are compared to the unaudited year ended december   and the five months ended december  are compared to the unaudited five months ended december  there are no seasonal or other significant factors which affect comparability 
highlights for the year ended december   and additionally through the date of filing of this prospectus  include the following product pipeline announced that the company s new drug application for zolpimist to treat insomnia was accepted for filing by the us food and drug administration announced that par pharmaceuticals has been granted a sublicense for the development and commercialization of zensana 
announced that par pharmaceuticals has returned the rights to nitromist to us 
announced that two clinical studies comparing our zolpidem oral spray with zolpidem tablets met their primary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic and safety objectives 
announced that hana biosciences has notified us that ongoing scale up and stability experiments indicate that there is a need to make adjustments to the formulation and or manufacturing process  and that there will be a delay in the fda approval and commercial launch of zensana 
intellectual property received notification of the issuance of additional patents in canada and europe which further strengthens our intellectual property position in the oral delivery of pharmaceuticals 
the issued patents cover the use of multiple classes of drugs in oral sprays  including those for the treatment of pain  and for central nervous system disorders under our oral spray delivery system in canada  and analgesics  alkaloids  and nicotine in europe 
executive team and board of directors appointed steven b

drug development in the us and most countries throughout the world is a process that includes several steps defined by the us food and drug administration  or fda  or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries 
the fda approval processes relating to new drugs differ  depending on the nature of the particular drug for which approval is sought 
with respect to any drug product with active ingredients not previously approved by the fda  a prospective drug manufacturer is required to submit a new drug application  or nda  which includes complete reports of pre clinical  clinical and laboratory studies to prove such product s safety and efficacy 
prior to submission of the nda  it is necessary to submit an investigational new drug  or ind  to obtain permission to begin clinical testing of the new drug 
given that our current product candidates are based on a new technology for formulation and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been previously approved and that have been shown to be safe and effective in previous clinical trials  we believe that we will be eligible to submit what is known as a b nda 
we estimate that the development of new formulations of our pharmaceutical product candidates  including formulation  testing and submission of an nda  will require significantly less time and lower investments in direct research and development expenditures than is the case for the discovery and development of new chemical entities 
however  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate  or pre marketing approval relating to our proposed products may not be obtained on a timely basis  if at all  and research and development expenditures may significantly exceed management s expectations 
it is not anticipated that we will generate any revenues from royalties or sales of our product candidates until regulatory approvals are obtained and marketing activities begin 
any one or more of our product candidates may not prove to be commercially viable  or if viable  may not reach the marketplace on a basis consistent with our desired timetables  if at all 
the failure or the delay of any one or more of our proposed products to achieve commercial viability would have a material adverse effect on us 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
estimates of the nature  timing and estimated expenses of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  and the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  results of future clinical trials  the expense of clinical trials for additional indications  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals or changes in the regulatory approval process  the expense of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technologies and market developments  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our product candidates and we expect our costs to increase as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidates 
the following table summarizes our product candidates active ingredient or class of molecule indications stage of development partner approved product nitromist nitroglycerin acute angina fda approved product candidates zolpimist zolpidem tartrate sleeplessness nda submitted fda acceptance january  sumatriptan sumatriptan succinate migraines pilot efficacy study complete ropinirole ropinirole idiopathic parkinson s disease clinical development tizanidine tizanidine hydrochloride spasticity clinical development zensana ondansetron anti emetic clinical development hana biosciences par pharmaceuticals nitromist nitroglycerin lingual aerosol 
this product is indicated for acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease  and was approved by the fda in november previously  this product was partnered with par pharmaceuticals  or par  however  on august   we announced that par returned the rights to nitromist to us as part of par s strategy to concentrate its resources on supportive care in aids and oncology markets 
we are currently investigating strategic partners for this product 
zolpimist zolpidem oral spray 
zolpidem is the active ingredient in ambien  the leading hypnotic marketed by sanofi aventis 
a pilot pharmacokinetic  or pk  study in zolpidem oral spray with healthy subjects  completed in the first half of calendar  suggested that our formulation of zolpidem oral spray had a comparable pk profile to the ambien tablet but with a more rapid time to detectable drug levels 
in october  we announced positive results from a pilot pharmacokinetic study comparing our formulation of zolpimist to ambien tablets 
in the study  healthy male volunteers received zolpimist or ambien tablets in mg or mg doses 
for fasting subjects  fifteen minutes after dosing  of subjects using zolpimist achieved blood concentrations of greater than ng ml  compared to of subjects in the mg ambien tablet group and of subjects in the mg ambien tablet group 
the difference between the oral spray groups and tablet groups was statistically significant p 
twenty ng ml is a level generally believed to approximate the lower limit of the therapeutic range for zolpidem 
additionally  drug concentrations were measured at five and ten minutes post dosing 
at these early time points  the oral spray groups achieved drug levels five to thirty times greater than subjects in the corresponding tablet groups 
these differences were also statistically significant 
zolpimist has the potential to provide patients with the meaningful benefit of faster onset of sleep as compared to existing sleep remedies should future studies validate the already completed pilot pk study 
we submitted the nda for our zolpidem product candidate in the second half of  and the fda indicated acceptance of this nda filing in january we may obtain final approval from the fda by the fourth quarter of sumatriptan oral spray 
sumatriptan is the active ingredient in imitrex which is the largest selling migraine remedy marketed by glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
a pilot pk study of our sumatriptan oral spray with healthy subjects  completed in the second half of calendar  suggested that the formulation achieved plasma concentrations of sumatriptan in the therapeutic range 
in september we announced positive results from an additional pilot pharmacokinetic study  with our oral spray formulation of sumatriptan which demonstrated that sumatriptan oral spray achieves a statistically significant increase in absorption rate as compared with imitrex tablets 
the rate of drug absorption is believed to be the most important predictor of the degree and speed of migraine relief 
sumatriptan oral spray was evaluated in a four arm  crossover pharmacokinetic study comparing mg imitrex tablets to mg and mg of the oral spray in healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions 
at least of subjects receiving sumatriptan oral spray had detectable drug levels at three minutes post dosing  while at the same timepoint  only of subjects receiving mg imitrex tablets had detectable drug levels 
these differences are statistically significant 
at to minutes post dosing  all oral spray groups had statistically significantly higher mean concentration levels compared to mg imitrex tablets 
using published data for the currently marketed imitrex nasal spray as a proxy for therapeutic blood levels  we observed that by minutes post dosing  of the mg oral spray users achieved these critical plasma concentration levels while none of the subjects from the imitrex tablet group did so by this timepoint 
this result was also statistically significant 
furthermore  the study indicates up to a increase in relative bioavailability of oral spray in comparison to the imitrex tablet 
additionally  the pharmacokinetics of mg oral spray after a meal were evaluated 
sumatriptan oral spray was well tolerated 
while imitrex nasal spray was not included in this clinical study  the following represents a discussion of the results of our clinical study as compared to published data for imitrex nasal spray 
time to the first peak plasma concentration of sumatriptan which represents drug absorbed directly across the oral mucosa was approximately faster with the mg oral spray than what has been reported in the literature for the same dose of the imitrex nasal spray min 
vs 
min the mean concentration level achieved during this critical first phase of absorption is approximately greater for the oral spray than what was observed in published studies of the nasal spray ng ml vs 
ng ml 
relative bioavailability after administration of mg oral spray appears to be greater than published estimates for the same dose of the imitrex nasal spray 
sumatriptan oral spray may provide clinical benefits to migraine sufferers including  possibly  faster relief than imitrex tablets as well as greater tolerability than triptan nasal sprays 
further  if proven to be safe and effective  sumatriptan oral spray may be attractive to patients who have trouble taking oral medications due to nausea and vomiting caused by the migraine attack 
previously  we were targeting an nda submission for our sumatriptan product candidate in the first half of calendar  however  due primarily to funding constraints  at the present time  we are unable to make predictions for this program relative to sufficient funding  timing  future strategic partnerships  regulatory pathway or approval with the fda 
during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  including sumatriptan  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
as of the current date  we have not yet secured additional financing  and have therefore not resumed clinical development activity 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional capital  and as a result  there can be no assurances as to whether  and when  we will be able to resume our clinical development activities 
tizanidine oral spray 
tizanidine is indicated for the treatment of spasticity  a symptom of several neurological disorders  including multiple sclerosis  spinal cord injury  stroke and cerebral palsy  which leads to involuntary tensing  stiffening and contracting of muscles 
tizanidine treats spasticity by blocking nerve impulses through pre synaptic inhibition of motor neurons 
this method of action results in decreased spasticity without a corresponding reduction in muscle strength 
because patients experiencing spasticity may have difficulty swallowing the tablet formulation of the drug  our tizanidine oral spray may provide patients suffering from spasticity with a very convenient solution to this serious treatment problem 
we were previously targeting an nda submission for our tizanidine product candidate in calendar however  in june  we announced our near term clinical development strategy and our intention to focus the majority of our research and development resources on our two lead product candidates  zolpidem and sumatriptan oral spray 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  including tizanidine  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
as of the current date  we have not yet secured additional financing  and have therefore not resumed clinical development activity 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional capital  and as a result  there can be no assurances as to whether  and when  we will be able to resume our clinical development activities 
ropinirole oral spray 
ropinirole is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic parkinson s disease 
ropinirole oral spray is ideal for the geriatric population who may be suffering from dysphagia difficulty swallowing  of sufferers of parkinson s are years of age or older and it is estimated that of elderly people have some difficulty in swallowing 
our formulation of ropinirole oral spray may represent a more convenient way for the patient or healthcare provider to deliver ropinirole to patients suffering stiffness and or tremors 
we were previously targeting an nda submission for our ropinirole product candidate in calendar however  in june  we announced our near term clinical development strategy and our intention to focus the majority of our research and development resources on our two lead product candidates  zolpidem and sumatriptan oral spray 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  including ropinirole  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
as of the current date  we have not yet secured additional financing  and have therefore not resumed clinical development activity 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional capital  and as a result  there can be no assurances as to whether  and when  we will be able to resume our clinical development activities 
zensana ondansetron oral spray 
ondansetron is the active ingredient in zofran  the leading anti emetic marketed by gsk 
through july   this product candidate was licensed to hana biosciences  who was overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for this product in the us and canada 
on july   we entered into a product development and commercialization sublicense agreement with hana biosciences and par  pursuant to which hana biosciences granted a sublicense to par to develop and commercialize zensana 
par is responsible for all development  regulatory  manufacturing and commercialization activities of zensana in the united states and canada  including the development and re filing of the nda in the united states 
in addition  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with hana biosciences  pursuant to which hana biosciences relinquished its right to pay reduced royalty rates to us until such time as hana biosciences had recovered one half of its costs and expenses incurred in developing zensana from sales of zensana and we agreed to surrender for cancellation all  shares of the hana biosciences common stock we acquired in connection with execution of the original license agreement with hana biosciences 
par has announced that it expects to complete clinical development on the revised formulation of zensana during  and expects to submit a new nda for zensana by the end of in january  hana biosciences announced positive study results of a pivotal clinical trial for zensana 
hana biosciences submitted its nda on june  and such nda was accepted for review by the fda in august previously  hana biosciences targeted final approval from the fda and commercial launch in calendar however  on february   we announced that hana biosciences notified us that ongoing scale up and stability experiments indicate that there is a need to make adjustments to the formulation and or manufacturing process  and that there is likely to be a delay in the fda approval and commercial launch of zensana as a result thereof 
on march   hana biosciences announced its plan to withdraw  without prejudice  its pending nda for zensana with the fda 
we will receive a milestone payment from hana biosciences upon final approval from the fda 
in addition  we will receive double digit royalty payments based upon a percentage of net sales 
we retain the rights to our ondansetron oral spray outside of the us and canada 
propofol oral spray 
propofol is the active ingredient in diprivan  a leading intravenous anesthetic marketed by astrazeneca 
we continue to support our partner  manhattan pharmaceuticals  inc  or manhattan pharmaceuticals  who will oversee all clinical development and regulatory approval for this product candidate 
on july   manhattan pharmaceuticals announced its intention to pursue appropriate sub licensing opportunities for this product candidate 
veterinary 
our veterinary initiatives are being carried out largely by our partner  velcera  inc  or velcera 
in june  velcera announced that it had entered into a global license and development agreement with novartis animal health 
the agreement calls for novartis animal health to develop  register and commercialize a novel canine product utilizing velcera s promist platform  which is based on our patented oral spray technology 
as discussed above  certain of our product candidates are in early stages of clinical development and some are in preclinical testing 
these product candidates are continuously evaluated and assessed and are often subject to changes in formulation and technology 
as a result  these product candidates are subject to a more difficult  time consuming and expensive regulatory path in order to commence and complete the preclinical and clinical testing of these product candidates as compared to other product candidates in later stages of development 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us this requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses which in the normal course of business are subsequently adjusted to actual results 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition we receive revenue from consulting services and license agreements 
consulting revenues from contract clinical research are recognized in the period in which the services are rendered  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
upfront license agreement payments are initially deferred and subsequently amortized into revenue over the contractual period 
milestone payments related to license agreements are recognized as revenue when earned 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets of the company as of december  were represented by property and equipment  as the company has no intangible assets on its balance sheet 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in the market value of the assets 
the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the long lived assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on projected discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimate using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 
net long lived property and equipment as of december  was million 
the company reviewed its long lived property and equipment as of december   and has determined that their estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount of such assets  therefore  the company has not recognized an impairment loss for its long lived property and equipment 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which revises accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  which provided for the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for employees stock options 
sfas r required all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first quarter of the first annual reporting period that began after june  under sfas r  the use of the intrinsic value method and pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective august  and have selected the black scholes method of valuation for share based compensation 
sfas r requires that compensation cost be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r and for all options granted after the date of adoption 
the charge is being recognized in research and development and consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the original estimate of fair value of the options as of the grant date 
using the fair value method required by sfas r  for the years ended december  and  we recorded share based compensation of  or per share  and  or per share 
for the five months ended december  and  we recorded share based compensation of approximately  or per share and  or per share  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended july   we recorded share based compensation expense of approximately million or per share 
share based compensation for the year ended december  included a million credit relating to the modification and accelerated vesting of stock options issued to our former president and ceo  dr 
jan egberts 
we will continue to incur share based compensation charges in future periods 
as of december   unamortized stock based compensation expense of million remains to be recognized  which is comprised of million related to non performance based stock options to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  million related to restricted stock to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and million related to performance based stock options which vest upon reaching certain milestones 
expenses related to the performance based stock options will be recognized if and when the company determines that it is probable that the milestone will be reached 
as a result of cashless exercise provisions in our employee stock option agreements  the company used variable accounting treatment under the financial accounting standards board s interpretation  for issued and outstanding stock options from january through july on october   the company s board of directors rescinded the cashless exercise provision for all of the company s outstanding option grants 
through july   variable plan accounting continued to be applied for approximately  outstanding options  for which option exercise prices were modified from the original agreement 
the following table illustrates the pro forma effect on the company s net loss and net loss per common share as if the company had adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based compensation under sfas r for the fiscal year ended july  july  net loss as reported compensation credit resulting from variable plan accounting total share based employee compensation expense using the fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per common share as reported pro forma net loss the fair values of options granted during the fiscal year ended july  were estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions  respectively risk free interest rates of  dividend yield of  volatility factors of the expected market price of the company s common stock of  and an expected life of the options of five to ten years 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
results of operations years ended december  and december  unaudited license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the year ended december  were  as compared to million for the unaudited fiscal year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to non recurring milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreement with hana biosciences in the year ended december  consulting revenues from related parties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower revenue from velcera for veterinary products 
we are not currently performing any development work for velcera 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and december  unaudited 
fiscal year ended december  december  unaudited nitromist zolpidem sumatriptan zensana propofol tizanidine ropinirole other research and development costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following categories nitromist  zolpidem  sumatriptan  tizanidine and ropinirole third party direct project expenses relating to the development of the respective product candidates 
the majority of our research and development resources were devoted to our zolpidem and sumatriptan product candidates 
during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
as of the current date  we have not yet secured additional financing  and have therefore not resumed clinical development activity 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional capital  and as a result  there can be no assurances as to whether  and when  we will be able to resume our clinical development activities  zensana and propofol third party direct project expenses relating to the development of zensana and our propofol product candidate 
as our partners for the propofol product candidate  manhattan pharmaceuticals  and for zensana  par  are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates 
in light of hana biosciences announcements in february and march regarding the status of zensana  as described above  we devoted resources to this project during the three months ended march   including approximately  in third party costs  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase primarily related to product development costs for our zolpidem product candidate  including costs for clinical trials  manufacturing preparedness and other nda preparatory costs   increase primarily related to product development costs for our sumatriptan product candidate  including costs for clinical trials and manufacturing preparedness   increase in internal costs primarily due to an increase in payroll and other compensation costs as of result of research and development related higher headcount  and  decrease in costs associated with our nitromist product candidate primarily due to process validation and method transfer activities in the year ended december   which did not recur in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the slight decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower stock compensation charges and a greater proportion of payroll associated with research and development activities  partially offset by higher legal expenses 
primarily as a result of the factors described above  total expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  other loss  net for the year ended december  is comprised of the following items december  other than temporary impairment of investment in marketable equity security loss from return of investment in marketable equity security to issuer write off of deferred revenue relating to investment in marketable equity security total other loss  net  non cash charge recorded to write down our investment in hana biosciences as we determined that the decline in market value was other than temporary   non cash charge to account for the return of hana biosciences shares  as a result of the amended and restated license agreement with hana biosciences  and  benefit to write off the remaining deferred revenue related to the shares received hana biosciences 
interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  due to higher average cash and short term investment balances 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  these increased income tax benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  five months ended december  and unaudited license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the unaudited five months ended december  the increase is primarily due to milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreements for zensana with hana biosciences and nitromist with par pharmaceuticals 
consulting revenues from related parties for the five months ended december  were as compared to  for the five months ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue from velcera related to veterinary products 
research and development expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the five months ended december  and unaudited nitromist zolpidem sumatriptan zensana propofol alprazolam tizanidine ropinirole other research and development costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following categories nitromist  zolpidem  sumatriptan  tizanidine and ropinirole third party direct project expenses relating to the development of the respective product candidates 
we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to our zolpidem and sumatriptan product candidates and expect that costs associated with these product candidates should increase in future periods  zensana and propofol third party direct project expenses relating to the development of zensana 
as our partners  hana biosciences and manhattan pharmaceuticals  are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for these product candidates  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates  alprazolam third party direct project expenses relating to the development of our alprazolam oral spray product candidate 
we have determined that  in order to devote sufficient resources to other product candidates  it is appropriate to defer further efforts on alprazolam  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the five months ended december  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase related to the establishment of a reserve for certain raw materials and process validation batches for our nitromist product candidate   increase primarily related to product development and clinical trial costs for our zolpidem product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our tizanidine product candidate  and  decrease related to clinical trail material costs for zensana incurred during the five months ended december  such costs did not recur during the five months ended december  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the decrease in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to lower payroll and other personnel related costs during the period  partially offset by higher costs associated with external consultants 
total costs and expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses  partially offset by the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses noted above 
interest income for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december  due to higher average cash and short term investment balances and a general increase in interest rates 
income tax benefit for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december  these increased income tax benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december fiscal years ended july  and license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase is primarily due to milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreement for ondansetron with hana biosciences 
consulting revenues from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue from velcera and manhattan pharmaceuticals  related to veterinary products and propofol  respectively 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended july  and nitromist zolpidem sumatriptan zensana propofol alprazolam tizanidine ropinirole other research and development costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following categories nitromist  zolpidem  sumatriptan  tizanidine and ropinirole third party direct project expenses relating to the development of the respective product candidates 
we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to our zolpidem and sumatriptan product candidates and expect that costs associated with these product candidates should increase in future periods  zensana and propofol third party direct project expenses relating to the development of zensana 
as our partners  hana biosciences and manhattan pharmaceuticals  are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for these product candidates  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates  alprazolam third party direct project expenses relating to the development of our alprazolam oral spray product candidate 
we have determined that  in order to devote sufficient resources to other product candidates  it is appropriate to defer further efforts on alprazolam  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended july  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase related to process validation and method transfer activities for our nitromist product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our zolpidem product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our sumatriptan product candidate   increase related to other research and development costs primarily as a result of higher lab supplies expense   decrease related to our alprazolam product candidate as we have decided to defer further efforts on this product candidate  and  decrease related to internal costs primarily as a result of lower headcount in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the increase in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to the following items  non cash charge in the fiscal year ended july  for stock compensation expense   decrease in outside legal costs  and  decrease attributable to a non cash charge recorded in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant 
total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the net increases in research and development and selling general and administrative expenses noted above 
interest income for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for fiscal year ended july  due to a general increase in interest rates 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  these benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july liquidity and capital resources from our inception  our principal sources of capital have been consulting revenues  private placements and public offerings of our securities  as well as loans and capital contributions from our principal stockholders 
we have had a history of recurring losses  giving rise to an accumulated deficit as of december  of  as compared to  as of december  we have had negative cash flow from operating activities of  for the year ended december    for the five months ended december    for the fiscal year ended july   and  for the fiscal year ended july  as of december   we had working capital of  as compared to  as of december   representing a net decrease in working capital of approximately  as explained further below  such decrease is primarily attributable to a net decrease in cash  short term investments and investment in marketable equity security and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase is primarily due to the following  increase in net loss in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  as more fully described above  the increase in the net loss is primarily due to a decrease in revenues and an increase in total expenses   decrease in deferred revenue for the year ended december   as compared to a  decrease for the year ended december  such fluctuation is attributable to the write off and recognition in the statement of operations of deferred revenue associated with the hana biosciences shares and upfront license payments from par during the fiscal year ended december    increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the year ended december   as compared to a  increase for the year ended december  such fluctuation is attributable to an increase in prepaid supplies associated with increased clinical and manufacturing activities for our key products  zolpidem and sumatriptan  and  non cash charge in the year ended december  related to the write down and subsequent return to issuer of an investment in hana biosciences  offset by a  non cash charge in the year ended december  for an increase to the reserve for inventory 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  used in investing activities for the year ended december  the difference is primarily a result of higher net maturities of short term investments in the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the  decrease is primarily attributable to the year ended december  including  of net proceeds from private placements we completed in april and december  as compared to the year ended december  including the remaining  of net proceeds received in january from the private placement we completed in december until and unless our operations generate significant revenues and cash flow  we will attempt to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the sources of capital described below 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon achieving sales and positive cash flows from operating activities  and or obtaining additional financing 
the most likely sources of financing include private placements of our equity or debt securities or bridge loans to us from third party lenders  license payments from current and future partners  and royalty payments from sales of approved drugs by partners 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
on december   we completed a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in which we received gross proceeds of million and approximate net proceeds of million  of which million was received in december and million was received in january during the fourth quarter  we significantly reduced clinical development activities on our product candidate pipeline  as we did not believe that we had sufficient cash to sustain such activities 
despite this reduction in expenditures for clinical activities  we require capital to sustain our existing organization until such time as clinical activities can be resumed 
given the current level of spending  we estimate that we will have sufficient cash on hand to fund operations through the middle of the second calendar quarter  funding for the company s future development activities could be secured through new strategic partnerships and or the sale of our common stock or other securities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us in a timely manner or on favorable terms  if at all 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to our attempt to complete a financing or strategic partnering arrangement that are outside our control 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unsuccessful at obtaining additional financing as needed  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease operations 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we achieve profitability  if ever 
our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   were prepared under the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern 
we were incorporated in  and do not have a history of earnings 
as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit report has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
continued operations are dependent on our ability to complete equity or debt formation activities or to generate profitable operations 
such capital formation activities may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
if we cannot continue as a viable entity  our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our aggregate contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total year years years years capital leases operating leases consulting agreement employment agreements total contractual cash obligations we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses from costs related to the continued development of our product candidates  clinical trials  and administrative activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  however  we do not believe that a decrease in interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
