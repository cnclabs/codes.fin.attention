overview chicken segment fiscal operating results declined as compared to fiscal due largely to increased input costs of approximately million  including increased grain costs  other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients 
these increases were partially offset by increased average sales prices  as well as increased net gains of million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases  which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions that will impact future period operating results 
beef segment fiscal operating results improved compared to fiscal as operating margins significantly improved in the latter half of the year  with an operating margin of in the last six months of fiscal while sales volume was down with the closure of our emporia  kansas  slaughter operation  operating margins improved due to improved average sales prices and operational efficiencies 
pork segment we achieved record operating income of million  an increase of million as compared to fiscal  due to adequate hog supplies and strong domestic and export demand 
prepared foods segment declines in operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal for our prepared foods segment were primarily due to increased raw material costs  partially offset by increased average sales prices

our outlook for segments in fiscal includes chicken export markets  credit availability and the recent strengthening dollar have negatively impacted leg quarter pricing 
international leg quarter sales will be difficult at least through the beginning of fiscal we have seen grain prices drop significantly from all time highs this past summer that if sustained  will benefit us in the long run 
however  we have some grain positions that could negatively impact us depending on corn and soybean meal closing prices at the end of the first quarter fiscal beef we expect cattle supplies will be down in fiscal  but there should be ample supply to run our plants efficiently 
we will continue to focus on the operational efficiencies from fiscal and expect a successful fiscal pork while we anticipate fewer hog supplies in fiscal  we expect we will have an adequate supply to achieve good operating results 
this segment should continue to do well in fiscal  but likely not at the record amounts we had in fiscal prepared foods high input costs will likely continue in fiscal demand for our products remains strong  which should provide for sales volume growth in fiscal tyson foods  inc

deterioration of credit and capital markets credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal and continue into our first quarter of fiscal several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures 
while not all inclusive  the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business credit facilities cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures 
however  we rely on our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs  letters of credit  and as a source of financing for international growth 
our revolving credit facility has total committed capacity of billion 
as of september   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  none of which were drawn upon  which left million available for borrowing 
our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of banks  with commitments ranging from million to million per bank 
if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility  our liquidity could be impaired  which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy 
our accounts receivable securitization facility has million of committed funding  of which the entire amount was available for borrowing as of september  our accounts receivable securitization facility is funded by a syndicate of three banks  with a commitment of million per bank 
to date  all of the banks in the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments despite the recent market turmoil 
if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility  our liquidity could be impaired  which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy 
we have borrowed against this facility subsequent to fiscal and all of the banks in the syndicate performed their obligations to fund these borrowings

current market conditions have also resulted in higher credit spreads on long term borrowings and significantly reduced demand for new corporate debt issuances 
equity class a common stock equity prices  including our own class a common stock  have fallen and experienced abnormally high volatility during the current period 
if these conditions persist  our cost of capital will increase significantly 
customers suppliers the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions 
although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers  current market conditions increase the probability that we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults 
should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad  demand for protein products could be reduced  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows 
investments the value of our investments in equity and debt securities  including our marketable debt securities  company owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets  has been negatively impacted by the recent market declines 
these instruments were recorded at fair value as of september   however  subsequent to september   through november   we have seen an additional reduction in fair value of approximately million 
while we believe this reduction in fair value is temporary  if current market conditions continue  we could be required to recognize million of expense in the first quarter of fiscal the remaining change in fair value would be deferred in other comprehensive income unless determined to be permanently impaired 
we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans 
all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of approximately million to these plans for fiscal we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of approximately million to this plan in fiscal financial instruments as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options  to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases 
similar to the capital markets  the commodities markets have seen a similar decline over the past several months 
grain prices reached an all time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal before falling sharply to the current levels 
while the reduction in grain prices benefit us long term  we may be required to record additional losses related to these financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal if grain prices remain lower than prices at the end of fiscal insurance we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims  property damage and various other risks 
our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better 
nevertheless  we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment

additionally  certain domestic subsidiaries guaranteed this facility and pledged inventory as collateral 
we were in compliance with all covenants at september  based on the current industry outlook and our internal forecasts  we anticipate we will be in compliance with our debt covenants throughout fiscal however  our chicken segment in the first part of fiscal will be negatively impacted by difficult export markets and long grain positions that could negatively impact our covenant compliance

apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the amount allocated to the equity component represents a discount to the debt  which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
therefore  we expect to adopt the provisions of fsp apb beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the provisions of fsp apb are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
upon retrospective adoption  we anticipate our effective interest rate on our convertible senior notes due will range from to  which would result in the recognition of an approximate million to million discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax amount recorded to capital in excess of par value 
this discount will be accreted until the maturity date at the effective interest rate  which will not materially impact fiscal interest expense  but will result in an estimated million to million increase to our fiscal interest expense

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 
effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  livestock procurement  securities  environmental  product  taxing authorities and other matters  and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
marketing and advertising costs we incur advertising  retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs 
these programs include cooperative advertising  volume discounts  in store display incentives  coupons and other programs 
marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred 
we accrue costs based on the estimated performance  historical utilization and redemption of each program 
cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products  thus recorded as a reduction to sales 
the remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program 
these estimates are based on many factors  including experience of similar promotional programs 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in our marketing accruals at september   would impact pretax earnings by approximately million

effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions accrued self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare  workers compensation  auto liability and general liability claims 
we use an independent third party actuary to assist in determining our self insurance liability 
we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability  including claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability 
our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range 
our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used 
costs to settle our obligations  including legal and healthcare costs  could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change 
incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a increase in the actuarial range at september   would not impact the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability 
a decrease in the actuarial range at september   would result in a gain in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition 
when evaluating long lived assets for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset 
we recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal years  and our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset  including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material

effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
how ever  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
for our other intangible assets  if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assess ment date for goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disrup tions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units  generally our operating segments  using various valuation techniques  with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about sales  operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
while estimating the fair value of our beef and chicken reporting units  we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the margins realized in the most current year 
the fair value estimates for these reporting units assume normalized operating margin assumptions and improved operating efficiencies based on long term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef and chicken industries 
we estimate the fair value of our beef reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount  including goodwill  by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 
we estimate the fair value of our chicken reporting units would be in excess of its carrying amount  including goodwill  by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 
other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method and using the present value of future cash flows for patents and in process technology 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years 
as a result of the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  the second step was not necessary 
however  a decline in fair value of our beef reporting unit or an decline in fair value of our chicken reporting unit would have caus ed the carrying values for these reporting units to be in excess of fair values which would require the second step to be per formed 
the second step could have re sulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 
while we believe we have made reason able estimates and assumptions to calc ulate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets  it is possible a material change could occur 
if our actual results are not consistent with our est imates and assumptions used to calculate fair value  we may be required to perform the second step which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill 
during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into november  our market capital ization was below book value 
while we considered the market capitalization de cline in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill  we determined it did not impact the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe the decline to be primarily attributed to the negative market condi tions as a result of the credit crisis  ind ications of a possible recession and current issues within the poultry industry 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and poultry industry events 
our fiscal other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge 
a hypo thetical decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment

effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions income taxes we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income 
federal income taxes include an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset 
we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
this analysis is performed in accordance with the requirements of fin  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal year changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future 
our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate 
our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contain uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds of fin we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances 
however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which fin liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded fin liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution

the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value  as defined by sfas no 
 is recognized immediately 
additionally  we hold certain positions  primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges 
these positions are marked to market  and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date 
changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales 
changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
commodities risk we purchase certain commodities  such as grains and livestock  in the course of normal operations 
as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options  to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
however  as the commodities underlying our derivative tyson foods  inc

contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting
