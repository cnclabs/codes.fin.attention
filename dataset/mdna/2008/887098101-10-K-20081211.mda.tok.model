item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
special note regarding forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis and results of operations and other portions of this form k contain certain forward looking statements concerning future operations of the company 
management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
the company has used forward looking statements to describe future plans and strategies  including its expectations of the company s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could affect actual results include interest rate trends  the general economic climate in the company s market area and the country as a whole  the ability of the company to control expenses  deposit flows  demand for mortgages and other loans  real estate values  vacancy rates  results of examinations by banking regulatory agencies  competition  loan delinquency rates  and changes in federal and state regulation 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made on behalf of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified two policies  that as a result of judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights msrs 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  generally describes the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
the allowance is based upon management s comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance for loan loss level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are capitalized when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with servicing rights retained and are amortized to servicing income on loans sold in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the value of msrs at the date of the sale of loans is determined based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
the estimated fair value is evaluated at least annually for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time servicing assets were originated 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msrs portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msrs fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at different times

operating strategy the company is a bank holding company which operates primarily through its subsidiary  the bank 
the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
the primary elements of the bank s operating strategy include diversify primary market area by expanding branch office network 
in an effort to lessen its dependence on the grays harbor county market whose economy has historically been tied to the timber and fishing industries  the bank has opened branch offices in pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties 
pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties contain the olympia  bremerton  and seattle tacoma metropolitan areas and their economies are more diversified with the presence of government  aerospace and computer technology industries 
in october  the bank continued its geographic diversification by acquiring two branches in lewis county as part of a seven branch acquisition 
in august  the bank announced plans to open an additional full service branch in lewis county 
the bank s existing loan production office in lewis county will be consolidated into the new facility  which is expected to open in limit exposure to interest rate risk 
in recent years  a majority of the loans that the bank has retained in its portfolio generally have periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention primarily have included arm loans and short term construction loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the interest rate sensitivity of these adjustable rate and short term loans more closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s funding sources than other longer duration assets with fixed interest rates 
emphasize residential mortgage lending 
the bank has historically attempted to establish itself as a niche lender in its primary market areas by focusing a part of its lending activities on the origination of loans secured by one to four family residential dwellings  including loans for the construction of residential dwellings 
in an effort to meet the credit needs of borrowers in its primary market areas  the bank originates one to four family mortgage loans that do not qualify for sale in the secondary market under fhlmc guidelines 
the bank has also been an active participant in the secondary market  originating residential loans for sale to the fhlmc on a servicing retained basis 
the bank occasionally retains fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio for yield and asset liability management purposes 
emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank has hired additional commercial loan officers since for the purpose of increasing the bank s origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
increase the consumer loan portfolio 
in the bank hired a consumer loan specialist to increase the origination of consumer loans 
the consumer loans generated since that time have been secured primarily by real estate 
the bank expects to continue expanding its portfolio of consumer loans 
pursue low cost core deposits and deposit related fee income 
the bank has placed an emphasis on attracting commercial and personal checking accounts 
these transactional accounts typically provide a lower cost of funding than certificates of deposit accounts and generate non interest fee income 
in october  the bank increased its transaction account base by acquiring seven branches and the related deposits 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market  and retaining the related mortgage servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by fimac solutions  llc fimac  a company that specializes in providing the financial services industry interest risk rate risk and balance sheet management services 
based on a rate shock analysis prepared by fimac  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income by approximately  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income by approximately  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
see quantitative aspects of market risk below for additional information 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than seven years generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans constituted million or  of the bank s total mortgage loan portfolio due after one year 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the model provided for the bank by fimac estimates the changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by fimac based on data at september  net interest income current market value projected interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base dollars in thousands      base    does not include loan fees 
includes boli income  which is included in non interest income on the consolidated financial statements 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a decrease in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a decrease in npv and a increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in net interest income in a rising rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in decreases in npv in rising and declining rate scenarios 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  the company s total assets increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans receivable and a million increase in cash equivalents 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in investment and mortgage backed securities 
this asset growth was primarily funded by a million increase in deposits and a million increase in fhlb advances 
the company s capital increased by  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result of retained net income and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  reduced by the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases 
the company remains well capitalized with a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at september  a more detailed explanation of the changes in significant balance sheet categories follows cash equivalents cash equivalents increased by million or to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily reflected in a million increase in federal funds sold as the company increased its liquidity position 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investment and mortgage backed securities including fhlb stock decreased by million or to million at september  from million at september   primarily as the result of the maturity or call of us agency securities  the redemption of mutual funds  and regular amortization and prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
in june  the company redeemed its million investment in the amf family of mutual funds for the underlying securities and cash  and recorded a loss of million 
the company used the proceeds from the security maturities and prepayments to fund loan growth rather than reinvesting into investment securities

loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased by million or to million at september  from million at september  the increase in the portfolio was primarily a result of a million increase in construction loans net of the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process  an million increase in commercial real estate loans  a million increase in one to four family mortgage loans  and a million increase in commercial business loans 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in multi family loans 
loan originations including participation interests purchased decreased by to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in loan originations was primarily a result of lower demand for financing in the bank s market areas due to a slowing economy and a tightening in the bank s underwriting standards 
the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans during the year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  for additional information on loans  see item business lending activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
premises and equipment premises and equipment increased by  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily as a result of the purchase of land for the bank s new branch facility that will be constructed in lewis county  and remodeling costs associated with several branch offices 
these increases were partially offset by depreciation and the sale of a building in grays harbor county that previously served as a branch facility 
for additional information on premises and equipment  see item properties and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
other real estate owned oreo oreo and other repossessed items totaled  at september  and consisted of one single family residence in pierce county and two vehicles

goodwill and core deposit intangible cdi goodwill and cdi decreased by  to million at september  from million at september  due to scheduled amortization of cdi 
the company recorded goodwill and cdi in connection with the october acquisition of seven branches and related deposits 
the company performed its annual review of goodwill as of june  and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill 
for additional information of goodwill and cdi  see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplemental data 
deposits deposits increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to a million increase is money market accounts  a million increase in now checking accounts  and a million increase in certificates of deposit accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non interest bearing accounts 
the increase in money market accounts was partially a result of a million short term deposit by a commercial customer that was transferred out of the deposit base and into the bank s certificate of deposit registry service cdars program in early october for additional information on deposits  see item business deposit activities and other sources of funds and note of the consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
fhlb advances and other borrowings fhlb advances and other borrowings increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  as the bank used additional advances to fund loan portfolio growth 
for additional information on borrowings  see item business deposit activities and other sources of funds borrowings and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased by  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result net income of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and a  net increase in the fair value of investment securities available for sale 
these increases to shareholders equity were partially offset by the payment of million in cash dividends to shareholders and share repurchases of million 
during the year ended september  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million an average price of per share 
the company had  shares remaining to be purchased on its existing stock repurchase plan at september  cumulatively  the company has repurchased  shares of the  shares that were issued in its initial public offering  at an average price of per share 
for additional information on shareholders equity  see the consolidated statements of shareholders equity contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily as a result of increased provision for loan losses  decreased non interest income due to a loss on the redemption of mutual funds  and increased non interest expenses  which were partially offset by increased net interest income 
diluted earnings per share decreased by to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in the level of non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
net charge offs were  during the year ended september   which was equivalent to of the average outstanding loans 
the decreased non interest income was primarily a result of a million loss on the sale of securities  as the company redeemed its investment in the amf family of mutual funds in june this loss was partially offset by increased income from service charges on deposit accounts and increased income from loan sales 
the increased non interest expense was primarily a result of increased employee costs and increased deposit related expenses 
the increased salary and employee benefit expenses were primarily a result of annual salary adjustments and increased insurance expenses 
the increased deposit related expenses were primarily a result of the expenses associated with several new deposit related programs implemented during the year 
the increased net interest income was primarily a result of a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a decrease in the company s net interest margin 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  decreased by million  or  to million  or per diluted share per basic share from million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the decrease in diluted earnings per share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted share charge from the redemption of the company s investment in the amf family of mutual funds  a million million net of income tax per diluted share increase in the provision for loan losses  and a   net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a   net of income tax per diluted share increase in net interest income  a million  net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest income  excluding the mutual fund redemption charge  and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 
net interest income net interest income increased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
total interest and dividend income increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average total interest earning assets increased by million 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest expense increased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average interest bearing liabilities increased by million 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a compression of the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earnings assets decreased at a greater rate than funding costs were decreased 
this was primarily a result of the decreasing interest rate environment which reduced yields on loans at a faster pace than the bank was able to reduce deposit and borrowing costs 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
the bank had a net charge off of  for the year ended september  compared to a net charge off of  for the year ended september  the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of individual loans on non accrual status  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
management s analysis  however  for the year ended september   placed a greater emphasis on the bank s construction and land development portfolio and the effect of various factors such as geographic and loan type concentrations 
the bank also reviewed the national trend of declining home sales with potential housing market value depreciation 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market and economy 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a million loss on the redemption of investments in the amf family of mutual funds 
non interest income  excluding the mutual fund redemption loss increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million from the year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a  increase in income from loan sales gain on sale of loans and servicing income on loans sold 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily a result of implementing a new automated overdraft decision system during the year and increasing the fee charged for overdrafts 
the increase in income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar value of fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans sold during the year 
the sale of fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans totaled million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  non interest expense total non interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in salary and benefit expenses and a  increase in deposit related expenses 
salary and benefit expenses increased primarily as a result of annual salary adjustments and increased health insurance expenses 
deposit related expenses increased primarily as a result of the expenses associated with several new deposit related programs implemented during the year and an increase in fdic insurance expense recorded as the bank s credit with the fdic was fully depleted during the quarter ended june  the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the efficiency ratio  excluding the mutual fund redemption loss  was for the year ended september  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended september  was also impacted by the million loss on the redemption of mutual funds 
the redemption of the mutual funds resulted in a capital loss which can only be deducted for tax purposes to the extent that capital gains are realized within a three year carry back period and a five year carry forward period 
the company has estimated that it will have  in capital gains during the allowable tax period to offset the capital loss 
therefore million of the million loss has been treated as non deductible for tax purposes 
the company s effective tax rate was or exclusive of the mutual fund redemption loss and associated tax impact for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income was nearly identical at million for the years ended september  and as increased net interest income was offset by increased non interest expense  increased provision for loan losses  and decreased non interest income 
diluted earnings per share  however  increased by to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased earnings per diluted share were primarily a result of a decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases 
the increased net interest income was primarily a result of a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a decrease in the company s net interest margin 
the increased provision for loan losses was primarily the result of a larger loan portfolio and an increase in the level of loans classified as substandard 
net charge offs remained low at only  during the year ended september   which is equivalent to of average outstanding loans 
the increased non interest expense was primarily a result of increased employee costs and increased advertising expenses 
the increased salary and employee benefit expenses were primarily because of a larger employee base and annual salary adjustments  and the increased advertising expenses were primarily the result of additional advertising campaigns 
the decreased non interest income was primarily a result of decreased income from service charges on deposit accounts and decreased fee income from the sale of non deposit investment products 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  increased by  to million  or per diluted share per basic share from million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the increase in diluted earnings per share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted share increase in net interest income and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 
these items were partially offset by a   net of income tax per diluted share increase in the provision for loan losses  a   net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest expense and a   net of income tax per diluted share decrease in non interest income 
net interest income net interest income increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
total interest and dividend income increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average total interest earning assets increased by million 
the yield on interest earning assets increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average interest bearing liabilities increased by million 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a compression of the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as funding costs increased at a greater rate than yields increased on interest earning assets 
this was primarily due to an increased reliance on wholesale funding fhlb advances and brokered deposits and increased competition for deposits in the company s primary market areas  which increased overall funding costs 
also factoring into the decrease in this year s net interest margin was the collection of prepayment penalties and non accrual interest last year which increased the net interest margin for the year ended september  by approximately basis points 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to  for the year ended september  compared to no provision made during the year ended september  the provision for loan losses increased primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio and an increase in the level of loans classified as substandard 
the bank had a net charge off of  for the year ended september  compared to a net recovery of  for the year ended september  the net charge offs recoveries to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of individual loans on non accrual status  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to a larger loan portfolio loans receivable and loans held for sale  which increased by million to million at september  from million at september  also contributing to the increased allowance was an increase in the level of loans classified as substandard 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date

any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a  decrease in service charges on deposits and a  decrease in fees from the sale of non deposit investment products  and a  decrease in gain on sale of loans 
the decrease in income from service charges on deposits was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of customer overdrafts 
the decrease in gross fees received from that sale of non deposit investment products was primarily due to decreased sales and a change in the fee structure with the bank s third party vendor 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in atm transaction fees and an  increase in servicing income on loans sold 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  non interest expense increased in the current year primarily due to a  increase in salary and benefit expenses  a  increase in advertising expenses  a  increase in atm expenses  a  increase in premises and equipment expense and smaller increases in several other expense categories 
the increased salary and benefit expenses were primarily due to a larger employee base and annual salary adjustments and the increased advertising expenses were a result of additional advertising campaigns 
also contributing to the increase in non interest expense was a  change in the other real estate operations expense category 
this change was primarily due to larger gains on the sale of oreo properties that were included in this category during the fiscal year

the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
