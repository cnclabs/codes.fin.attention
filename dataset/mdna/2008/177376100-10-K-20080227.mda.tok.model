item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to our consolidated financial statements included therein  in the fourth quarter of  the audit committee of our board of directors commenced a voluntary independent investigation of certain of our stock option granting practices and the related accounting during the period from january through december this investigation was conducted by the audit committee with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel and outside forensic accounting consultants 
in addition to those grants evaluated as part of the audit committee s investigation  we also evaluated all grants consisting of two employee new hire grants in december  which was the month the company completed its initial public offering  and all grants to non employee directors 
the audit committee completed its investigation in the second quarter of based on the facts obtained in connection with the audit committee s investigation and management s supplemental review  we concluded that stock options granted during the period from december to march  were accounted for using incorrect measurement dates  which required a restatement of our previously filed financial statements 
we incurred significant expenses related to legal  accounting  tax and other professional services in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and the related restatements  and may incur significant expenses in the future with respect to such matters  including as a result of litigation matters or additional cash and non cash charges 
for example  as described in part i  item legal proceedings  purported stockholder derivative actions have been filed relating to certain of our historical stock option grants 
even if resolved favorably  these matters may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the impact and outcomes of current or future litigation matters are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  as described in the explanatory note to our annual report on form k for the year ended december   management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  in part iv item  after the audit committee completed its investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and our review of the accounting treatment for our historical stock option grants  we recorded additional stock based compensation expenses and related tax effects with regard to certain past stock option grants  and we restated previously issued financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  although we believe we made appropriate judgments in determining the financial and tax impacts of our historical stock option granting practices and have consulted with the office of the chief accountant of the sec on certain interpretive matters  we cannot provide assurance that regulatory authorities  including the internal revenue service  or irs  will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial and tax impacts 
specifically  in light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and those differences could be considered material 
we considered various alternative approaches and believe that the approaches used by us were appropriate under the circumstances 
for a complete discussion of the judgments underlying the revised measurement dates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  if regulatory authorities disagree with our financial or tax adjustments and such disagreements result in material changes to our historical financial statements  we may be required to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec or take other action that is not currently contemplated 
in addition  other adjustments for non operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option related matters arising under any litigation commenced against us 
if stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we provide most of our distributors with stock balancing return rights  which generally permit our distributors to return products to us by the forty fifth day of a fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
we also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period 
to cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments  we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans 
however  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments 
if we inadequately forecast reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our stock price could be volatile  and you could lose the value of your investment 
our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future 
your investment in our stock could lose some or all of its value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  
table of contents analyst reports or recommendations  changes in interest rates  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general  the nasdaq global select market formerly  the nasdaq national market  and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
changes or modifications in financial accounting standards related to share based compensation may have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  a complex accounting standard that requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the application of sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding stock price volatility  option forfeiture rates and expected option lives  to build a model for appropriately valuing share based compensation 
there is a risk that  as a result of subsequent accounting guidelines or changes in our business  we could determine that the assumptions or model we used requires modification 
any such modification could result in significantly different charges in future periods and  potentially  could require us to correct the charges taken in prior periods 
these modifications  as well as any such corrections of charges taken in a prior period could negatively affect our results of operations  stock price and our stock price volatility 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our net revenues have fluctuated quarterly and have generally been the highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends 
in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced level of economic activity in europe during the summer 
this seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues 
quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the release of new products and services 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter  especially our fourth quarter  are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
funds from certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible within months and our auction rate securities may experience an other than temporary decline in value  which would adversely affect our income 
in february  approximately million of our investment portfolio consists of municipal auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
the market for municipal auction rate securities held in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures on february  if the issuers of the affected securities are unable to successfully complete future auctions or refinance their obligations and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these securities and recognize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair values of these securities which will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
all of our auction rate securities  including those having recently experienced an auction failure  are currently rated triple a by one or more rating agencies 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired 
based on our available cash and other investments  we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by failed auctions related to these securities will have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows or will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic political and social conditions 
general economic and market conditions  and other factors outside our control including significant natural disasters  terrorist attacks or military actions  could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments 
for example  an economic downturn could result in impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments 
impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
as of december   we had million of short and long term investments  including restricted investments  with various issuers and financial institutions 
in many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the value of our investments  and we could lose some of our investment portfolio 
a total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on these investments  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

the complaints name citrix systems  inc and citrix online llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of citrix systems  inc  as defendants and seek unspecified damages and other relief 
in january  a similar suit naming citrix systems  inc was filed in the united states district court of the eastern district of texas 
in response  we filed answers denying infringement and alleging  among other things  that the asserted claims of these patents are invalid 
with respect to the northern district of ohio case  on november   the court held a hearing for the purpose of construing disputed terms of the claims of the patent in suit  and on march   the court issued a claim construction ruling 
on march   we moved for leave to amend our answer in that case to assert an affirmative defense and counterclaim of inequitable conduct  which is a complete defense 
on august   the court granted our motion 
on december   we filed motions for summary judgment in the northern district of ohio case  seeking judgment that the asserted patent is invalid and that we have not infringed the patent  as well as judgments on other  non dispositive issues 
on the same day  we filed a request with the united states patent and trademark office seeking inter partes reexamination of the patent in suit  and we subsequently filed a request with the court in the northern district of ohio seeking a stay of the litigation pending the patent office s determination of our reexamination request 
the court has all of these motions under advisement 
the patent office has not yet ruled on our reexamination request 
trial in the northern district of ohio case currently is scheduled to begin march  trial in the southern district of florida case currently is scheduled to begin april   and trial in the eastern district of texas case currently is scheduled to begin june  in addition  the united states patent and trademark office has decided to reexamine the patent at issue in the southern district of florida case 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the allegations made in each of the complaints and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits  however  we are unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential exposure to loss  if any

the demand letter sought  among other things  the commencement by our board of directors of an action against our directors and officers from forward for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the granting of the options 
a special committee of independent directors was appointed to review and consider the assertions contained in the demand letter 
the special committee has completed its work and has determined that it would not be in the best interests of the company to pursue the claims referred to in the demand letter 
in july  two additional purported stockholder derivative actions entitled ekas v

table of contents caused to us 
neither the purported stockholder derivative actions nor the demand letter described above seeks to recover amounts from us 
an amended complaint in the ekas action  which contains additional allegations concerning our stock option granting practices was filed on december  during the course of our stock option investigation  we have periodically met and discussed the results of this investigation with the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
on january   we received a letter from the sec staff stating that the staff has completed its investigation and does not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the sec against us 
in addition  we are a defendant in various litigation matters generally arising out of the normal course of business 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases  we believe that the ultimate outcome will not materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
we license most of our products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates  when not bundled with the initial product release or purchase  technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement 
table of contents based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for license updates 
in the normal course of business  we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any other conditions  unless the product item is defective in manufacture  but we do provide most of our distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
product items returned to us under the stock balancing program must be in new  unused and unopened condition 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  and december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment on january   the effective date for such adoption 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we did not recognize compensation cost related to stock options granted to our employees and non employee directors that had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant in our consolidated statement of income prior to january  we elected to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r  is recognized beginning with the effective date for all stock based awards granted to employees after the effective date and prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
in addition  under the modified prospective method prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we considered the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the 
table of contents option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
beginning in  we began issuing non vested stock units and non vested stock with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units or non vested stock underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units or non vested stock that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options  non vested stock and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas no 
r and sab no 
is relatively new from an application perspective and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of sfas no

core and product technology assets we have acquired our core and product technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
in applying purchase accounting  we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the core and product technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of core and product technology assets acquired 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value of the core and product technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the core and product technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single industry segment consisting of the design  
table of contents development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand 
our revenues are derived from sales of our citrix delivery center products and related technical services in the americas  emea  and asia pacific regions and from online services sold by our online services division 
these three geographic regions and the online services division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these segments  which represent our reporting units 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas and online services division reportable segments 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of december  there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy  product portfolio or reportable segments  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that no valuation allowance was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and risk factors  which could impact our future performance and financial position 
stock option investigation and related matters on november   our audit committee commenced a voluntary  independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting during the period from january through december in addition to the grants management evaluated as part of the audit committee s investigation  we also evaluated all grants consisting of two employee new hire grants in december  which was the month we completed our initial public offering  and all grants to non employee directors 
this voluntary investigation was not in response to any governmental investigation  stockholder lawsuit  whistleblower complaint or inquiries from media organizations 
our annual report on form k for the year ended december   which was filed on september   contains a description of the audit committee s investigation  management s related review  the conclusions of the audit committee and management and the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the related consolidated statements of income  stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended december  and  and each of the quarters in the and fiscal years  to reflect additional stock based compensation expense and related income tax effects for stock option awards granted since december since the beginning of our stock option investigation on november   we have incurred approximately million in professional fees in connection with the investigation 
of the million in investigation related expenses  we incurred approximately million during the year ended december  
table of contents results of operations our operations consist of the design  development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand with high performance  enhanced security and improved total cost of ownership  or tco 
we market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers  channel distributors  system integrators  independent software vendors  our websites and original equipment manufacturers 
a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher  these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
if the dollar is strong  foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower  and our hedging practices will cause these lower expenses to be partially offset by the aggregate loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
due to the generally weaker dollar during the year ended december   our operating expenses benefited from gains in our hedging programs as compared to the year ended december  our cost of services revenues and operating expenses increased for when compared to due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no

product licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following products our application virtualization products  including xenapp formerly presentation server and access essentials  our application networking products  including our netscaler  access gateway and wanscaler products  our application performance monitoring products  including edgesight  and our server virtualization products  including provisioning server formerly ardence and xenserver  both acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our channel distributors and value added resellers to stimulate demand for our products 
revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and value added resellers 
our application virtualization product license revenue accounted for approximately of our product license revenue for the year ended december   of our product license revenue for the year ended december  and of our product license revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in our application virtualization product license revenue as a percent of our total product license revenue when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased sales of our application networking products  including the full year impact of the addition of our wanscaler products  and to a lesser extent  the addition of our provisioning server products in and the full year impact of our edgesight products 
during  we expect our application virtualization product license revenue to continue to decrease as a percent of our total product license revenue primarily due to expected increases in sales of our newly acquired xenserver product and our application networking products 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
we anticipate that subscription advantage will continue to be of strategic importance to our business throughout because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream 
online services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products  which is recognized as the services are provided

technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to the full year impact and increased sales of support and services related to our application networking products and an increase in sales of services and support related to the implementation of our application virtualization products 
deferred revenue deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from our subscription advantage product  online services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services products and technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts 
deferred revenues increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  primarily due to increased renewals of our subscription advantage product  increased new sales of our subscription advantage product  increased sales of our online service agreements and  to a lesser extent  sales of services related to our application networking products 
we currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in we do not believe that backlog  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of future performance 
while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of the same period

table of contents historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 
cash and investments year ended december  compared to in thousands cash and investments the increase in cash and investments at december  as compared to december   is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans  partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information 
in february  we held approximately million in triple a rated municipal auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
the market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures on february  for the securities that experienced a failure the issuer will pay interest at a failure rate on the regular auction date  which is every days for the securities in our portfolio 
the securities will not be liquid until the auctions are successful or the issuers are able to refinance  call and or restructure their obligations to a different interest rate mode 
in the event we need to access the funds related to the affected securities  we may not be able to do so without a potential loss of principal unless future auctions on these securities are successful 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their obligations and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these securities and recognize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair values 
based on our available cash and other investments  we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by the failed auctions of these securities will have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows or financial position 
restricted cash equivalents and investments year ended december  compared to in thousands restricted cash equivalents and investments restricted cash equivalents and investments as of december  and are primarily comprised of approximately million in investment securities and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease arrangement 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
for further information regarding our synthetic lease  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  accounts receivable  net year ended december  compared to in thousands accounts receivable allowance for returns allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net 
table of contents the increase in accounts receivable at december  compared to december  was primarily due to an increase in sales  particularly in the last month of compared to the last month of our allowance for returns remained relatively constant during as compared to the activity in our allowance for returns was comprised of million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during offset by million of provisions for returns recorded during and million charged to other accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million when comparing to the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts was comprised primarily of an additional million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year partially offset by million of uncollectible accounts written off  net of recoveries 
from time to time  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers  which are comprised of large business enterprises  governments and small and medium sized businesses 
if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  our operating results could be adversely affected 
at december  and  no distributor or customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable 
for more information regarding significant customers see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  credit facility and term loan effective on august   we entered into the credit facility with a group of financial institutions  or the lenders 
effective september   we entered into an amendment and restatement of the credit facility  or the amendment 
the amendment decreased the overall range of interest we will pay on amounts outstanding on the credit facility and lowered the facility fee 
in addition  the amendment extended the term of the credit facility 
the credit facility  as amended  allows us to increase the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of million 
the credit facility  as amended  currently provides for a revolving line of credit that will expire on september  in the aggregate amount of million  subject to continued covenant compliance 
a portion of the revolving line of credit i in the aggregate amount of million may be available for issuances of letters of credit and ii in the aggregate amount of million may be available for swing line loans 
the credit facility  as amended  currently bears interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
in addition  we are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from to based on the aggregate amount available under the credit facility  as amended  and the level of our total debt and adjusted ebitda 
during the year ended december   no funds were borrowed under the credit facility  as amended  and as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility  as amended 
effective on august   we entered into the term loan with the lenders 
the term loan provided for an eighteen month single draw term loan facility in the aggregate amount of million 
the term loan s interest rate was libor plus and adjusted in the range of to above libor based on the level of our total debt and adjusted ebitda 
in addition  we were required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from to based on the aggregate amount of the term loan and the level of our total debt and adjusted ebitda 
we used the proceeds from the term loan to partially fund the repatriation of certain of our foreign earnings in connection with the ajca 
in february  we repaid the remaining million outstanding under the term loan in full 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of billion  of which million was authorized in january we may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted 
the objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders return 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock 
a significant portion of the funds used to repurchase stock was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
during and  we entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the term of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement  depending on market conditions 
we did not enter into any structured stock repurchase agreements or repurchase any shares of outstanding common stock during our voluntary investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting 
we made up front payments to financial institutions  net of cash and premiums received of approximately million in and million in under our structured stock repurchase arrangements 
in addition  we received cash and premiums of approximately million in and million in from expired prepaid programs based upon the terms of those agreements 
we took delivery of  shares at an average price of per share in and we took delivery of  shares at an average price of per share in from our structured repurchase agreements 
as of december   we had 
table of contents prepaid notional amounts of approximately million remaining under our structured stock repurchase programs  which expire on various dates through september due to the fact that the total shares to be received under our structured repurchase arrangements at december  is not determinable until the contracts mature  the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements 
during  we expended approximately million on open market purchases and repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of and  during  we expended approximately million on open market purchases and repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations synthetic lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations represent non cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year end 
total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with fin no 
 because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information 
as of december   we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangement during  we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do not include the property as an asset or the lease debt as a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
we do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources 
for information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see contractual obligations 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment 
if an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below million  we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted cash  cash equivalent or investment balance of approximately million as collateral  which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance of million  excluding our collateralized investments  equity investments and outstanding debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of this required level 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor  the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with fin no 
revised 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the associated debt in a future period 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements 
during  capital expenditures were primarily related to the implementation of certain systems to streamline business operations and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement  which assigned the operating lease and all remaining liability related to one of the closed offices to a third party 
lease obligations related to the remaining existing operating lease continue to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates  and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
because virtually all holders of stock options granted by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing of certain options  we have taken and intend to take further actions to address certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of such incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that the re measured options vesting after december  subject the option holder to a penalty tax under section a of the irc and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state laws 
as a result during  we recorded million  net of income tax benefits  in liabilities related to the anticipated payment by us of payroll and excise taxes on behalf of our employees for options that were exercised during open tax years under the related statutes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  
table of contents exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  australian dollars  swiss francs  indian rupees  japanese yen  singapore dollars  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  danish krone and swedish krona 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease the asset by million  resulting in a net liability position 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
during  we entered into the credit facility  as amended in  or the amended credit facility 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million amended credit facility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december  in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters in fort lauderdale  florida 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters property  under this synthetic lease  were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
