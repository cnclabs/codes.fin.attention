overview shire s strategic goal is to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
shire focuses its business on adhd  hgt  gi and renal diseases 
the structure is sufficiently flexible to allow shire to target new therapeutic areas to the extent opportunities arise through acquisitions 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection either in the us or europe 
shire believes that a carefully selected portfolio of products with relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
on april   consistent with its stated focus on the growing adhd market  shire completed the acquisition of new river allowing shire full ownership and control of vyvanse 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures  operating profits or losses and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments specialty pharmaceuticals and human genetic therapies 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which are within the specialty products segment and are within the human genetic therapies segment  of total revenues are derived from royalties 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
objectives are also set at the business  functional and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the group wide strategic and operational objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management 
key performance indicators kpis are used to measure achievement of the objectives 
strategic objectives are categorized into fields financial  customers  people capabilities and operational excellence 
for  shire s corporate objectives included defined levels of revenue growth  target sales and contributions for core products  execution of defined therapeutic area strategic and operational plans  drug application filing and launch targets for new products  product in licensing targets  the expansion of shire s geographic presence in key emerging markets  completion of out licensing projects  implementation of an effective leadership development program  and maintenance of robust risk management practices including internal controls 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection  and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
with the acquisition of tkt in  shire substantially increased its presence in europe and thereby diversified the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market 
through the tkt acquisition  shire acquired elaprase global rights  replagal which is presently sold only outside the us and dynepo to which the company has exclusive marketing rights outside the us 
in addition  saw the european launches of mezavant and the continued roll out of fosrenol in europe 
for  sales outside north america represented approximately of net product sales and shire expects this upward trend to continue in shire s late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with rights outside of the us  including vyvanse  daytrana  velaglucerase alfa acquired as part of the tkt acquisition  spd  plicera and amigal 
shire s continued expansion in europe will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the north american and european markets wherever possible 
in and the  europe should see the continued roll out of mezavant  and the launch of daytrana  in and  the us should see the launch of vyvanse for adult patients  the launch of intuniv  and the launch of fosrenol for ckd in patients pre dialysis 
this program of new product launches will require significant investment in advertising  promotional spend and in some cases  additional sales representatives  leading to an increase in overall selling  general and administrative sg a costs for  although sg a costs are expected to fall as a proportion of product sales 
the specialist nature of hgt products means that relatively low associated sg a and sales infrastructure investment is required  making them ideal products for shire to launch into new markets 
shire will continue to consider launching products in new markets where entry barriers are low 
in markets outside north america and europe where products require significant sg a and infrastructure investment  shire will assess opportunities for internal investment verses out licensing partners on a country by country basis 
in both replagal and elaprase were launched in japan  in partnership with dsp and genzyme  respectively 
r d over the last four years shire has focused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas  which meet the needs of the specialist physician 
the company has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for its later stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas 
evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the company s development pipeline over the last four years 
since january  eight products have received regulatory approval in the us including daytrana and elaprase in  lialda in january and vyvanse in february and four in europe including elaprase and mezavant in january 
the company has another three products in registration in the us including vyvanse for adult patients and intuniv and daytrana in registration in the eu and canada 
shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
shire s acquisition of tkt was driven  in part  by the comparatively low risk of developing protein replacement therapies for genetic disease compared to other drug discovery approaches 
r d costs in will include expenditure on phase b and phase studies to support recently launched products in the specialty pharmaceutical business  and the development of new projects in both the specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt businesses 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and generally be able to sell the company s drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than shire s 
the company anticipates that there will be one or more generic competitors to adderall xr in the adhd market beginning april adderall xr is  in revenue terms  shire s most significant product representing of total revenues in 
the company expects that sales of vyvanse will partially offset any decline in sales of adderall xr and that vyvanse prescriptions will come from a number of sources  including patients who are new to adhd treatment  patients who previously were taking adderall xr  and patients who were taking another adhd medication 
however  there is a risk that the company may not be able to transition patients successfully from adderall xr or other adhd medications to vyvanse 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its adderall xr patents and the patents for certain other products 
these are discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings 
in consequence of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and market exclusivity 
business development the company remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business strategy  its existing therapeutic areas or are in complementary therapeutic areas

in process r d ipr d on april  shire completed its acquisition of new river by way of a short form merger  in an all cash transaction 
the acquisition of new river allows shire to capture the full economic value of vyvanse  and gain control of the future development and commercialization of this product 
during the year to december  shire expensed the portion of the new river purchase price allocated to ipr d of  million 
this amount represents the value of those acquired development projects which  at the acquisition date  had not been approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities  specifically vyvanse indicated for adhd in non pediatric patients in the us  million and vyvanse in row million 
during the fourth quarter of the company reduced the values ascribed to intangible assets by million and ipr d by million from amounts previously assigned in the preliminary purchase price allocation as a result of changes to preliminary estimates of deferred taxes in the purchase price allocation exercise 
on the acquisition date  vyvanse had only achieved regulatory approval for use in pediatric patients in the us 
on june  shire submitted a snda to the fda for vyvanse for the treatment of adhd in adults in the us 
the pdufa date for the fda to issue a formal response to this application is april  and material net cash inflows would be anticipated one to two years after any approval 
at december   management estimated that future r d costs until regulatory approval for vyvanse for adhd in non pediatric patients in the us are approximately to million 
this estimate can be affected by various factors and is  in part  based on management s estimate and assumptions 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows 
on the acquisition date vyvanse in row had not received regulatory approval 
planning is underway for submission of vyvanse for the row  the filing for canada is in preparation and anticipated in the filing in europe is expected to require clinical studies before submission  those studies are due to start in with filing anticipated in management estimates that material net cash inflows would be anticipated one to two years after the approval and that future r d costs until regulatory approval for vyvanse for adhd in row are approximately to million 
these estimates can be affected by various factors and are  in part  based on management s estimate and assumptions 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows 
the company considers that these ipr d assets have no alternative future use outside their current development projects and these assets have therefore been charged to expense in the consolidated statement of operations as of the acquisition date in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no

shire has a further obligation to pay noven million  contingent on future sales performance 
v women s health products in september  shire and duramed entered into an agreement related to seasonique  a number of products using duramed s transvaginal ring technology and other oral products 
shire has the right to market these products in a number of markets outside of north america  including the larger european markets 
under this agreement  shire will reimburse duramed for us development expenses incurred going forward up to a maximum of million over eight years from september us development expenditure reimbursement for the year to december  totaled million

shire is separately responsible for development costs in its licensed territories 
vi other r d and sales milestones in addition to the commitments set out in i to v  at december  the company had commitments payable on achievement of specified milestones and fees payable for products under development in licensed from third parties of million million 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of operating units in the company have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pound sterling  euro and swedish krona 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and foreign exchange losses of million are reported in other income on the consolidated income statement 
as at december   the company had outstanding swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency risk associated with inter company transactions 
for further information  see item a to this annual report 
as at december  the fair value of these contracts was an asset of million 
concentration of credit risk the company s revenues from product sales are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were three customers in the us who accounted for of the company s total revenues 
however  such clients typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments and trade accounts receivable 
excess cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits from a variety of financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
these investments typically bear minimal risk 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for litigation  valuation of intangible assets including those acquired through the acquisition of tkt and new river  the valuation of ipr d  the valuation of the settlement of the pre existing relationship between shire and new river  the valuation of equity investments  sales deductions  income taxes and share based payments and the amount payable to former holders of tkt common stock of approximately million shares who have submitted written demands for appraisal of these shares in relation to the company s acquisition of tkt on july  i litigation the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to product liability  intellectual property infringement claims and appraisal rights litigation in relation to the acquisition of tkt 
shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period 
during the year to december  the company changed its estimates of provisions for litigation losses in relation to the settlement of patent infringement disputes  resulting in a release of million of its existing provision 
the company additionally established a provision of million in respect of settlement of the purported tkt securities fraud class action shareholder suit as further discussed in note d 
ii valuation of intangible assets a general the company has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets  recorded at acquisition cost 
as at december   the carrying value of such intangibles was  million  which primarily related to the company s daytrana  dynepo  fosrenol  pentasa  reminyl  replagal  vyvanse and xagrid products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
a prolonged general economic downturn  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s valuation of the estimated future net cash flows generated by its long lived assets 
as a result  future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by impairment charges related to the recoverability of long lived assets 
in the year to december   changes to the estimated future net cash flows from certain products resulted in a million impairment of intangible assets million  million 
in the year to december   the company decreased the estimated life of a product  which resulted in an additional amortization charge of million in the year to december  and million in the years to december and the company reviews intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flow approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
b intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt and new river the fair values of all of the identifiable intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt and new river have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  the customer relationships and the other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products  cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  the estimated life of the products  and the tax amortisation benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management and are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows 
the company reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flow approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the discounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
iii valuation of ipr d charge ipr d is defined by fin as being a development project that has been initiated and achieved material progress but i has not yet reached technological feasibility or has not yet reached the appropriate regulatory regulatory approval  ii has no alternative future use  and iii the fair value is estimable with reasonable certainty 
as required by fin  the portion of the purchase price ascribed to ipr d  acquired as part of the tkt acquisition in million  and the new river acquisition in  million  has been immediately expensed in the year of the acquisition 
significant ipr d projects expensed to income include elaprase  velaglucerase alfa and dynepo in respect of the tkt acquisition  and vyvanse indicated for adhd in non pediatric patients and vyvanse indicated for adhd in the rest of the world in relation to the new river acquisition 
in the identification of intangible assets  consideration is given to whether any technology that is identified is developed or in process 
the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries gives guidance on the factors that should be considered when identifying ipr d 
the fair value of ipr d acquired with tkt and new river was determined using the income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d assets has been based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cashflows expected to be generated by the ipr d projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these projects 
this method includes risk factors  which include applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the project s stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the valuation of ipr d acquired with new river assumes that  consistent with eitf  accounting for pre existing relationships between parties to a business combination  eitf the effective settlement of the pre existing relationship between shire and new river has occurred and the company has purchased of the forecast future cashflows see v below 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific ipr d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses to complete the development of the acquired products  and the tax amortisation benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal 
the valuation process for ipr d involves a number of inter relating assumptions  such that the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion of the acquired ipr d projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing clinical trials and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
the valuations have been based on information at the time of the acquisition and expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by shire s management  and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows 
iv valuation of the effective settlement of the pre existing relationship between shire and new river prior to the acquisition of new river in april  shire entered into a collaboration agreement with new river which governed the development  manufacture and commercialization of vyvanse for the treatment of adhd in the us the us collaboration agreement and rest of the world row territories  the row territory license agreement  together the new river collaboration agreements 
shire paid an initial sum of million to new river in january on signing the new river collaboration agreements and a further million was paid by shire to new river following acceptance of the filing of a nda by the fda in january these amounts were expensed to r d in accordance with the company s accounting policies 
further details on the new river collaboration agreements can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report on form k 
as shire had a pre existing relationship with new river  shire has applied eitf in accounting for the effective settlement of the new river collaboration agreements 
eitf requires a business combination in which the acquirer and acquiree have a pre existing relationship to be treated as a multiple element transaction  with one element being the business combination  and the other element being the effective settlement of the pre existing relationship 
in accordance with eitf  the effective settlement of an executory contract in a business combination as a result of a pre existing relationship should be measured at the lesser of the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable from the perspective of the acquirer when compared to pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items  or any stated settlement provisions in the contract available to the counterparty to which the contract is unfavourable 
the company has measured the effective settlement of the new river collaboration agreements resulting from its pre existing relationship with new river and has determined that  in respect of the us collaboration agreement  it was less favorable to the company when compared with pricing for current market transactions for similar items 
the company determined that row territory license agreement was at current market rates 
although the us collaboration agreement is deemed less favorable to the company at the time of the acquisition when compared with pricing for current market transactions for similar items  the company has not recorded a loss on the effective settlement of the pre existing relationship in the consolidated statement of operations  nor has the company adjusted its purchase price for new river to reflect any such loss resulting from this effective settlement  as settlement provisions in the us collaboration agreement available to the company would have enabled effective settlement of the new river collaboration agreements at no cost to the company 
the valuation of the existing new river collaboration agreements and a current market transaction required the company to exercise significant judgment the company considers that critical estimates used to value the existing and current market contract include a estimates of the forecast future cash flows for vyvanse  the specific assumptions used to determine forecast future cash flows being outlined in ii and iv above  b estimates of the a market value profit share or royalty rate for a current market contract for an approved product  and c estimates of a market royalty rate for the unapproved row indication 
the valuation of both the existing new river collaboration agreement and a current market transaction involved a number of inter relating assumptions  such that the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption 
the valuation of the existing new river collaboration agreements and a current market comparator have been based on information at the time of the acquisition and expectations and assumptions that a have been deemed reasonable by shire s management  and b are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or events will occur as projected 
v valuation of equity investments the company has investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period  adverse news on a company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value of an investment the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compound  ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition of the investee 
in instances when the review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  the company writes down the investment to the fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  shire recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of million million  million to an investment in a public company 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized loss on a publicly quoted investment is other than temporary requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire recorded impairments on long term investments in private companies of nil million million  nil million 
vi sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for coupon sampling programs 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
the company accounts for these sales deductions in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  as applicable 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and hmo rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to hmos under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation 
as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total discounts to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers including data provided by wholesalers and third party prescription data such as ims health national prescription audit data 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
however  since the prices of the company s products are fixed at the time of sale and the quantum of rebates is therefore reasonably determinable at the outset of each transaction  these factors would not impact the recording of revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and hmo rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or hmo 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as at the balance sheet date  accruals for medicaid and hmo rebates were million in  million in and million in  or   and  respectively  of net product sales 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including past product returns activity  the duration of time taken for products to be returned  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel  product recalls and discontinuances  the shelf life of products  the launch of new drugs or new formulations  and the loss of patent protection or new competition 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  third party prescription data and  for some product return provisions  market research of retail pharmacies 
returns for new products are more difficult for the company to estimate than for established products 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which are typically guaranteed sales  as the company cannot determine customer acceptance of the new product  the company s policy is therefore to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance primarily third party prescription data  in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as at the balance sheet date  provisions for product returns were million in  million in and million in  or  and  respectively  of net product sales 
sales coupon accrual for certain products  primarily adderall xr  vyvanse  lialda and daytrana  the company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive 
these coupons reimburse part or all of the cost of the first prescription 
each coupon can only be used once and coupons typically expire three to months after the date of issuance 
the company s management calculates an accrual for the estimated value of coupons that will be redeemed against sold products  based on the rebate value per coupon  the timing and volume of coupon distributions  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel and expected coupon redemption rates  using historical trends and experience 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers and third party prescription data 
shire believes that historical redemption rates  adjusted for known changes in coupon programs such as length of coupon life and redemption conditions are an appropriate basis for predicting future redemption rates 
for coupon programs open at december  the redemption rates assumed by shire range between and of coupons distributed depending on the life of the coupons 
a one percentage point increase in estimated coupon redemption rates would increase the provision at december  by million 
at december  the accrual for coupon redemptions was million million  million 
the accrual levels at december  and within each financial year fluctuate according to the timing and volume of coupon distributions  in addition to changes in estimated redemption rates 
for rebates  returns and sales coupons the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire reviews its estimates every quarter and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
historically  actual payments have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
vii income taxes in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
with effect from january  in the application of fin  management is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized in the financial statements  based on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities 
the measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgement  is greater than likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible outcomes 
in applying fin  management is required to make judgements in the determination of the unit of account  the evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken  together with the estimates of amounts that the company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
shire develops its cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal expertise  experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from shire s best estimate may result in additional or lower tax expense in future periods 
at january  the company had recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits and had accrued million for the payment of interest and penalties 
at december  the company has recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits and had accrued million for the payment of interest and penalties 
the company has significant deferred tax assets due to net operating losses nols in the united states  uk and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize these losses  based upon the availability of the prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nols a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results 
at december   the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million against 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded valuation allowances of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded valuation allowances of million against this amount 
viii share based payments shire plc has historically granted options to the company s directors and employees over ordinary shares under six stock option plans 
on november  the ordinary shareholders of shire plc approved the adoption of the shire plc portfolio share plan parts a and b  a new share based compensation plan  which provides for stock settled share appreciation rights and performance share awards to be made to the directors and employees over ordinary shares and adss 
further details on these plans can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in the part iv of this annual report 
effective january  the company adopted the provisions of sfas r which establishes accounting for share based compensation for employees 
the company measures share based compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and recognizes the cost as an expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee requisite service period 
where there are more than one potential requisite service period  based on service or performance conditions  the company bases its accruals of compensation cost on the probable outcome of the performance condition  with compensation cost accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
the company measures share based compensation cost for awards classified as liabilities at fair value  which is re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the company estimates the fair value of share based awards without market based performance conditions using a black scholes valuation model and awards with market based performance conditions are valued using a binomial valuation model 
several critical assumptions are made in the determination of the company s share based compensation cost 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions are the expected life of the award  the requisite service period  the weighted average volatility of the company s stock and estimates as to the probability of performance conditions being achieved 
other assumptions made by the company in respect of the determination of share based compensation cost include the risk free rate  the expected dividend yield and the expected forfeiture rate 
the company s estimate of the expected life of the award  for awards granted prior to december   is based on the simplified method as discussed in sab the weighted average volatility is based upon historical share price data of the company s stock for the requisite expected life of the awards
