deerfield management  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates deerfield  have committed funding for our allergy programs 
recent developments heplisav heplisav  our product candidate for hepatitis b prophylaxis  is based on proprietary iss that specifically targets tlr to stimulate an innate immune response 
heplisav combines iss with hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag and is designed to significantly enhance the level  speed and longevity of protection 

table of contents previously reported clinical trial results have shown seroprotection after two doses in subjects to years of age  and after three doses in difficult to immunize subjects to years of age 
we recently announced that two investigational new drug ind applications for heplisav have been placed on clinical hold by the us food and drug administration fda due to a serious adverse event sae that occurred in one subject who received heplisav in a phase study being conducted outside the united states 
the subject was preliminarily diagnosed to have wegener s granulomatosis  an uncommon disease in which the blood vessels are inflamed 
all subjects in this phase clinical study have received all doses per the study protocol  and will continue to be monitored 
administration of vaccine has been suspended in the only study of heplisav where injections were being administered actively  a fully enrolled phase study in end stage renal disease esrd subjects being conducted in canada 
a total of approximately  individuals have been vaccinated with more than  doses of heplisav in clinical trials spanning approximately seven years 
no additional heplisav clinical trials will be initiated until the clinical hold has been resolved 
we and merck co  inc merck  along with additional collaborators  including clinical investigators and leading experts  are investigating the medical history of the individual who experienced the sae to understand better the onset of this diagnosed disease  including whether it was a pre existing condition 
as a result of the clinical hold  there can be no assurance that heplisav can continue in further development  or that if heplisav continues in development  that the fda will not require significant limitations impacting the timing and clinical data required to achieve approval 
in october  we entered into a global license and development collaboration agreement with merck to jointly develop heplisav 
under the terms of the agreement  merck received worldwide exclusive rights to heplisav  and agreed to fund future vaccine development and be responsible for commercialization 
we received an initial upfront payment of million  and will be eligible to receive development cost reimbursement  future development and sales milestone payments up to million  and double digit tiered royalties on global sales of heplisav 
under merck s oversight  we continue to manage the ongoing phase study in canada and europe as well as other licensure required studies 
the united states food and drug administration biologics licensing application bla and other marketing applications will be the joint responsibility of merck and dynavax  and are intended to be submitted by merck 
also in october  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with merck 
we are responsible for manufacturing the hepatitis b surface antigen component of heplisav for merck  which is expected to be produced at dynavax europe s d sseldorf  germany facility using our proprietary technology developed there and later  at our expanded facility to support expected market demand 
this manufacturing obligation is for years from the date of first major market launch of heplisav 
as a result of the clinical hold  there can be no assurance that heplisav can continue in further development 
merck may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us  and there can be no assurance that merck will continue the collaboration regardless of whether or not the clinical hold by the fda is released 
allergy franchise tolamba tolamba  our product candidate for the treatment of ragweed allergy  consists of iss linked to the purified major allergen of ragweed  amb a tolamba is designed to target the underlying cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by ragweed 
the linking of iss to amb a ensures that both iss and ragweed allergen are presented simultaneously to the same immune cells  producing a highly specific and potent inhibitory effect and suppressing the th cells responsible for inflammation associated with ragweed allergy 
in october  we began dosing of tolamba in subjects as part of an environmental exposure chamber study 
subjects were screened based on a history of ragweed allergy and a positive skin test 
exposure to ragweed allergen in the chamber is being used to select those individuals with confirmed ragweed allergic disease and establish their baseline level of symptoms 
subjects are being treated and will be re exposed in the chamber to determine the effect of the six week  six injection tolamba regimen as compared to placebo 
data from this study are expected in the first half of and  if positive  we intend to initiate a pivotal field study to support a potential bla submission 

table of contents peanut and cat allergy therapies our peanut and cat allergy programs involve direct linkage of certain allergens to a proprietary tlr agonist 
this approach is designed to mask the ige binding sites of the native allergen to ensure safety and to induce an allergen specific th to th immune shift to reprogram the immune response in allergic patients 
preclinical proof of concept studies have been generated with our peanut allergy approach  which provided protection in a mouse model of peanut induced anaphylaxis 
we anticipate that the clinical development path for a disease modifying peanut and cat allergy therapies to be focused on established challenge studies  in which both patient selection and study timing can be tightly controlled 
in july  deerfield and its affiliates committed up to million in project financing for a chamber study and subsequent field study for tolamba and to advance our preclinical peanut and cat allergy programs 
influenza vaccine we are developing a universal flu vaccine designed specifically to overcome the limitations of standard seasonal and pandemic vaccines 
our approach combines standard flu vaccine  required for generating neutralizing antibodies against matched strains  with conserved antigens np and me conjugated to a proprietary iss 
the iss component enhances the immune response to standard vaccine  potentially increasing the efficacy and reducing the amount of antigen required 
the conserved antigens enable protection against mismatched and pandemic strains  regardless of which strain ultimately causes a pandemic 
this is a key differentiator versus other pandemic vaccines  most of which specifically target an individual h or h strain that may not ultimately acquire the characteristics of a potentially pandemic strain 
in august  we were awarded a two year million grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  a division of the national institutes of health nih  to continue development of our universal influenza vaccine 
the new grant is directed toward advancing preclinical research into ind enabling studies and product development 
the immune system the immune system is the body s natural defense mechanism against infectious pathogens  such as bacteria  viruses and parasites  and plays an important role in identifying and eliminating abnormal cells  such as cancer cells 
the body s first line of defense against any foreign substance is a specialized function called innate immunity  which serves as a rapid response that protects the body during the days or weeks needed for a second longer term immune response  termed adaptive immunity  to develop 
unique cells called dendritic cells have two key functions in the innate immune response 
they produce molecules called cytokines that contribute to the killing of viruses and bacteria 
in addition  they ensure that pathogens and other foreign substances are made highly visible to specialized helper t cells  called th and th cells  which coordinate the longer term adaptive immune response 
dendritic cells recognize different types of pathogens or offending substances and are able to guide the immune system to make the most appropriate type of response 
when viruses  bacteria and abnormal cells such as cancer cells are encountered  dendritic cells trigger a th response  whereas detection of a parasite infection leads dendritic cells to initiate a th response 
th and th responses last for extended periods of time in the form of th and th memory cells  conferring long term immunity 

table of contents immune system the diagram above is a visual representation of how the immune system reacts when it encounters antigen 
upon encountering antigen  a cascade of events is initiated that leads to either a th or a th immune response  as described more fully in the paragraphs above 
the th response involves the production of specific cytokines  including interferon alpha  interferon gamma and interleukin  or il  as well as the generation of killer t cells  a specialized immune cell 
these cytokines and killer t cells are believed to be the body s most potent anti infective weapons 
in addition  protective igg antibodies are generated that also help rid the body of foreign antigens and allergens 
once a population of th cells specific to a particular antigen or allergen is produced  it persists for a long period of time in the form of memory th cells  even if the antigen or allergen target is eliminated 
if another infection by the same pathogen occurs  the immune system is able to react more quickly and powerfully to the infection  because the memory th cells can reproduce immediately 
when the th response to an infection is insufficient  chronic disease can result 
when the th response is inappropriate  diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis can result  in part from elevated levels of th cytokines 
activation of the th response results in the production of other cytokines  il  il and il these cytokines attract inflammatory cells such as eosinophils  basophils and mast cells capable of destroying the invading organism 
in addition  the th response leads to the production of a specialized antibody  ige 
ige has the ability to recognize foreign antigens and allergens and further enhances the protective response 
an inappropriate activation of the th immune response to allergens  such as plant pollens  can lead to chronic inflammation and result in allergic rhinitis  asthma and other allergic diseases 
this inflammation is sustained by memory th cells that are reactivated upon subsequent exposures to the allergen  leading to a chronic disease 
iss and the immune system our principal product development efforts are based on a technology that uses short synthetic dna molecules called iss that stimulate a th immune response while suppressing th immune responses 
iss contain specialized sequences that activate the innate immune system 
iss are recognized by a specialized subset of dendritic cells containing a unique receptor called toll like receptor  or tlr the interaction of tlr with iss triggers the biological events that lead to the suppression of the th immune response and the enhancement of the th immune response 

table of contents we believe iss have the following benefits iss work by changing or reprogramming the immune responses that cause disease rather than just treating the symptoms of disease 
iss influence helper t cell responses in a targeted and highly specific way by redirecting the response of only those t cells involved in a given disease 
as a result  iss do not alter the ability of the immune system to mount an appropriate response to infecting pathogens 
in addition  because tlr is found only in a specialized subset of dendritic cells  iss do not cause a generalized activation of the immune system  which might otherwise give rise to an autoimmune response 
iss  in conjunction with an allergen or antigen  establish populations of memory th cells  allowing the immune system to respond appropriately to each future encounter with a specific pathogen or allergen  leading to long lasting therapeutic effects 
we have developed a number of proprietary iss compositions and formulations that make use of the different ways in which the innate immune system responds to iss 
depending on the indication for which iss is being explored as a therapy  we use iss in different ways 
iss linked to allergens we link iss to allergens that are known to cause specific allergies 
by chemically linking iss to allergens  rather than simply mixing them  we generate a superior th response due to the fact that the iss and allergen are presented simultaneously to the same part of the immune system 
the linked molecules generate an increased th response by the immune system in the form of igg antibodies and interferon gamma 
in addition  the iss linked allergens have a highly specific and potent inhibitory effect on the th cells  thereby reprogramming the immune response away from the th response that causes specific allergies 
upon subsequent natural exposure to the allergens  the th memory response is triggered and may provide long term suppression of allergic responses 
iss linked to or combined with antigens we also link iss to antigens associated with pathogens such as viruses and bacteria to stimulate an immune response that will attack and destroy infected or abnormal cells 
iss  linked to or combined with appropriate antigens  increase the visibility of the antigen to the immune system and induce a highly specific and enhanced th response  including increased igg antibody production 
as with iss linked to allergens  this treatment also generates memory t cells that confer long term protection against specific pathogens 
this treatment may also have the potential for synergy with other cancer or infectious disease therapies 
iss alone we use iss alone in diseases like asthma  where a large variety of allergens may be associated with an inappropriate immune response 
iss administered alone may suppress the th inflammatory response caused by any number of allergens  modifying the underlying cause of inflammation  as well as providing symptomatic relief 
iss may also be used in conjunction with a variety of anti tumor monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy agents as a combination therapy  with the goal of stimulating the elimination of cancer cells 
advanced iss technologies we have developed proprietary technologies that modify the molecular structure of iss to significantly increase its versatility and potency 
we are using these technologies in most of our preclinical programs and believe that they will be essential to our future product development efforts 
our advanced iss technologies include iss like compounds  which we call cics  as well as advanced iss formulations 
cics are molecules that are a mixture of nucleotide and non nucleotide components 
we have identified optimal sequences that induce particular immune responses  including potent interferon alpha induction 
cics 
table of contents can be tailored to have specific immunostimulatory properties and can be administered alone  or linked to allergens or antigens 
we have also developed formulations for iss and cics that may dramatically increase their potency 
these advanced formulations can be used in situations where high potency is required to see a desired clinical outcome and can decrease the dosage of iss or cics required to achieve therapeutic effect 
our primary development programs our primary development programs are heplisav  allergy and influenza 
heplisav our hepatitis b vaccine candidate current hepatitis b vaccines consist of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with alum as an adjuvant 
heplisav is composed of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with iss and  unlike conventional three dose vaccines  appears to require only two vaccinations over one month to achieve protective hepatitis b antibody responses in healthy young adults 
in addition  clinical studies have demonstrated that heplisav offers higher levels of immunity in the age population  which responds poorly to current vaccines 
in october  we entered into a global license and development collaboration agreement with merck to jointly develop heplisav 
clinical status our ongoing multi center phase pivotal trial known as phast phase heplisav short regimen trial  which began in canada in late and in germany in june  has been placed on clinical hold by the fda as a precautionary matter due to a serious adverse event sae that occurred in one subject who received heplisav 
the study had enrolled over  subjects to years of age  and was designed to compare a two dose regimen of heplisav administered at and month to the conventional three dose regimen of engerix b marketed by glaxosmithkline administered at  and months 
in june  we initiated a safety and immunogenicity study in the us consistent with the phast trial  subjects to years of age received a two dose regimen of heplisav  at and month 
this safety study is designed to enable further clinical development in the us pending assessment of the sae in the phast trial  we placed on hold an ongoing phase trial initiated in august in canada in patients with esrd to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different doses of heplisav 
the trial had enrolled adults to years of age who have progressive loss of renal function and are either pre dialysis or hemodialysis patients 
this is a difficult to immunize patient population for whom conventional hepatitis b vaccines have shown limited efficacy 
results from phase and phase trials showed that heplisav was well tolerated and induced more rapid immunity with fewer vaccinations in both healthy young and older adults than glaxosmithkline s engerix b 
we conducted a phase trial in canada evaluating the immunogenicity of two doses of heplisav compared to engerix b 
a total of healthy young adults were enrolled in this study  randomized to our vaccine or engerix b 
results showed that heplisav induced a rate of protective hepatitis b antibody response after one dose and protective hepatitis b antibody response in of recipients after the second dose at two months 
in contrast  subjects receiving engerix b had protective hepatitis b antibody responses after the first and second doses in and of recipients  respectively 
we completed a phase trial in singapore  korea and the philippines that evaluated the immunogenicity of our vaccine in older subjects ages years who have a diminished ability to respond to current vaccines 
results showed superiority of heplisav compared to engerix b relative to the primary efficacy endpoint of seroprotection seroprotection in the heplisav vaccinated group compared to in the engerix b vaccinated group 
results also showed that subjects vaccinated with heplisav experienced more durable seroprotection 
at week  the heplisav vaccinated group retained seroprotection compared to for the engerix b vaccinated group 
the primary endpoint of the trial was seroprotection following three doses 
the safety profile of heplisav was comparable to engerix b 

table of contents commercial opportunity hepatitis b is a common chronic infectious disease with an estimated million chronic carriers worldwide 
prevention of hepatitis caused by hbv is central to managing the spread of the disease  particularly in regions of the world with large numbers of chronically infected individuals 
while many countries have instituted infant vaccination programs  compliance is not optimal 
moreover  a large number of individuals born prior to the implementation of these programs are unvaccinated and are at risk for the disease 
in addition  not all individuals respond to currently approved vaccines 
annual sales of hepatitis b vaccines are approximately billion globally 
in october  we entered into a global license and development collaboration agreement with merck to jointly develop heplisav 
under the terms of the agreement  merck received worldwide exclusive rights to heplisav  and agreed to fund future vaccine development and be responsible for commercialization 
we received an initial upfront payment of million  and will be eligible to receive development cost reimbursement  future development and sales milestone payments up to million  and double digit tiered royalties on global sales of heplisav 
under merck s supervision  we continue to manage the ongoing phase study in canada and europe as well as other licensure required studies 
the united states food and drug administration biologics licensing application bla and other marketing applications will be the joint responsibility of merck and dynavax  and are intended to be submitted by merck 
also in october  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with merck 
we are responsible for manufacturing the hepatitis b surface antigen component of heplisav for merck  which is expected to be produced at dynavax europe s d sseldorf  germany facility using our proprietary technology developed there and later  at our expanded facility to support expected market demand 
this manufacturing obligation is for years from the date of first major market launch of heplisav 
as a result of the clinical hold  there can be no assurance that heplisav can continue in further development 
merck may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us  and there can be no assurance that merck will continue the collaboration regardless of whether or not the clinical hold by the fda is released 
allergy franchise tolamba for ragweed allergy tolamba consists of iss linked to the purified major allergen of ragweed called amb a tolamba may target the underlying cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by ragweed and offers a six week treatment regimen potentially capable of providing long lasting therapeutic results 
the linking of iss to amb a ensures that both iss and ragweed allergen are presented simultaneously to the same immune cells  producing a highly specific and potent inhibitory effect 
preclinical data suggest that th cells responsible for inflammation associated with ragweed allergy are suppressed  leading to reprogramming of the immune response away from the th response and toward a th memory response so that  upon subsequent natural exposure to the ragweed allergen  long term immunity is achieved 
clinical status to date  tolamba has been administered to over  patients  and has been safe and well tolerated 
a phase study conducted in showed reduction p in total nasal symptom scores tnss in the first season which was maintained p in the second season with no additional therapy nejm oct  
this was a single site study with well characterized  severe allergic patients 
the phase study conducted in at centers in the us showed a reduction in symptoms in the first year p which was also maintained in the second year with no additional therapy p 
however  the largest study of tolamba the dartt study  conducted in in patients at us sites  failed to enroll patients with measurable ragweed allergic disease  therefore  the effect of the treatment could not be measured and the study did not achieve its primary endpoints 
a pre specified regional analysis demonstrated that sites in the midwest comprising over half the dartt study population did include patients with more pronounced ragweed symptoms 
in this group  the therapeutic benefit of tolamba in reducing total nasal symptom scores was evident  as reflected in a clinically meaningful reduction of tnss in 
table of contents the treated patients 
the data provided a rationale for continuing to evaluate our tlr based approach for treating ragweed and other allergic diseases 
in october  we began dosing of tolamba in subjects as part of an environmental exposure chamber study 
subjects were screened based on a history of ragweed allergy and a positive skin test 
exposure to ragweed allergen in the chamber is being used to select those individuals with confirmed ragweed allergic disease and establish their baseline level of symptoms 
subjects are being treated and will be re exposed in the chamber to determine the effect of the six week  six injection tolamba regimen as compared to placebo 
data from this study are expected in the first half of and  if positive  we intend to initiate a pivotal field study to support a potential bla submission 
commercial opportunity medical management of seasonal allergic rhinitis is a multibillion dollar global market 
in the us alone  approximately million people of the population suffer from allergic rhinitis 
the market for prescription interventions for allergic rhinitis was billion in ragweed is the single most common seasonal allergen  affecting approximately of those with allergic rhinitis  or million americans 
current treatment of allergic rhinitis includes prescription and over the counter otc pharmacotherapies such as antihistamines  corticosteroids  leukotriene antagonists and decongestants 
although currently available pharmacotherapies may provide temporary symptomatic relief  they can be inconvenient to use and can cause side effects 
in addition  these pharmacotherapies need to be administered chronically and do not modify the underlying disease state 
allergy shots  or immunotherapy  are employed to alter the underlying immune mechanisms that cause allergic rhinitis 
conventional immunotherapy is a gradual immunizing process in which pollen extracts are mixed by the allergist and administered to induce increased tolerance to natural allergen exposure 
the treatment regimen generally consists of weekly injections over the course of six months to a year  during which the dosing is gradually built up to a therapeutic level so as not to induce a severe allergic reaction 
once a therapeutic dosing level is reached  individuals then receive bi weekly or monthly injections to build and maintain immunity over another two to four years 
a patient typically receives between and injections over the course of treatment 
adverse reactions to conventional allergy immunotherapy are common and can range from minor swelling at the injection site to systemic reactions  and  in extremely rare instances  death 
other major drawbacks from the patients perspective include the inconvenience of repeated visits to doctors offices for each injection  the time lag between the initiation of the regimen and the reduction of symptoms  and the total number of injections required to achieve a therapeutic effect 
consequently  patient compliance is a significant issue 
we believe that a significant market opportunity exists for tolamba in the treatment of moderate and severe ragweed allergic individuals currently using multiple prescription or otc medications or undergoing conventional immunotherapy 
in addition  the convenience of the six week regimen and the unique  disease modifying aspect of this technology present an opportunity to widen usage to a broader patient population 
peanut and cat allergy therapies peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food related allergic reactions 
there are no currently available treatments 
cat allergy is one of the most common indoor allergens and a common cause of allergic asthma exacerbations 
current treatment is focused mainly on short term  symptomatic treatments which offer limited efficacy for patients 
we believe that iss linked to the major peanut and cat allergens may be able to suppress the th response and reduce or eliminate the allergic reaction without inducing anaphylaxis during the course of therapy 
our anticipated advantage in this area is the potentially increased safety that may be achieved by linking iss to the allergen 
by using iss to block recognition of the allergen by ige and therefore prevent subsequent histamine release  we may be able to administer enough of the iss linked allergen to safely reprogram the immune response without inducing a dangerous allergic reaction 
we believe the resulting creation of memory th cells may provide long term protection against an allergic response 

table of contents preclinical status peanut allergy therapy we have developed an initial peanut allergy product candidate that consists of iss linked to a major peanut allergen 
we have demonstrated in mice that peanut allergen linked to iss induces much higher levels of th induced igg antibodies and lower levels of ige than natural peanut allergen 
immunization with our product candidate has been shown to protect peanut allergic animals from anaphylaxis and death following exposure to peanut allergen 
in addition  we have demonstrated that iss linked peanut allergen has significantly reduced allergic response as measured by in vitro histamine release assays using blood cells from peanut allergic patients 
cat allergy therapy we are currently producing a recombinant fel d protein  the dominant allergen in cat dander 
this protein will then be conjugated to iss and tested in preclinical models for reduced allergenicity  the ability to induce th rather than th responses  and the ability to reduce the symptoms of allergy to fel d commercial opportunity peanut allergy therapy approximately million people in the us have a potentially life threatening allergy to peanuts and the incidence is growing rapidly 
there are an estimated to deaths from severe peanut allergy in the us each year 
because there are currently no products available that treat peanut allergy  people allergic to peanuts must take extreme avoidance measures  carefully monitoring their exposure to peanuts and peanut by products 
emergency response following peanut exposure and the onset of allergic symptoms primarily consists of the administration of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis 
our peanut allergy therapy is designed to allow patients to tolerate exposure to higher levels of peanut products without experiencing severe reactions 
cat allergy therapy cat allergy affects approximately of the allergic rhinitis population in the us and is unique in that patients are often highly motivated to seek therapeutic solutions due to significant quality of life impacts 
current treatment is focused mainly on short term  symptomatic treatments which offer limited efficacy for patients  with immunotherapy requiring injections over years  leading to poor compliance and compromised efficacy 
a disease modifying treatment for cat allergy would meet a unique unmet medical need 
influenza vaccine human viral influenza is an acute respiratory disease of global dimension with high morbidity and mortality in annual epidemics 
in the us  there are an estimated to thousand viral flu associated deaths per year 
pandemics occur infrequently  on average every to years  with high rates of infection resulting in increased mortality 
the last pandemic occurred in  and virologists anticipate that a new pandemic strain could emerge any time 
current flu vaccines are directed against specific surface antigen proteins 
these proteins vary significantly each year  requiring the vaccine to be reformulated and administered annually 
our approach links advanced iss to conserved flu antigens thereby generating potent antigens that confer immunity against divergent influenza strains 
we believe that iss linked conserved antigens added to conventional vaccine will not only confer protective immunity against divergent flu strains but will also increase antibody responses to the conventional vaccine due to the potent adjuvant effect of the iss component 
preclinical status in the fourth quarter of  we announced preclinical data that show our flu vaccine can improve the immunogenicity of conventional flu vaccines 
the data from mouse and primate models demonstrated that co administration of our flu vaccine with conventional vaccine enhances the immune response of the vaccine  allows reduction of vaccine dosage  and provides extra layers of protection that are not strain dependent 
in august  we were awarded a two year million grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  a division of the national institutes of health nih  to continue development of a novel universal influenza vaccine for controlling seasonal and emerging pandemic flu strains 
our research focuses on incorporating a second generation tlr agonist and the conserved influenza antigens 
table of contents nucleoprotein np and the extracellular domain of matrix protein me 
the new grant is directed toward advancing preclinical research into ind enabling studies and product development 
commercial opportunity there are over m doses of influenza vaccines sold in the us alone every year  generating over billion in sales 
the market continues to grow  as immunization rates increase and vaccine is readily available 
the dynavax approach is synergistic with both currently marketed and development stage influenza vaccines  including those targeting h virus  and has the potential to provide significant near and long term competitive advantages by providing a highly differentiated vaccine for seasonal influenza and an optimal strategy for developing a vaccine effective against pandemic influenza caused by antigenic shift 
additional programs in addition to our primary development programs  our pipeline includes programs in cancer  hepatitis b therapy  asthma and autoimmune disorders 
cancer therapy in oncology  we believe that the potent and multifaceted biological activities of iss offer a number of distinct approaches to cancer therapy in a wide range of tumor types 
extensive study in preclinical model systems has shown positive indications that iss may offer several benefits 
iss can be used in different ways depending on patient tumor profiles  either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and or monoclonal antibodies 
iss may also have the potential be used to treat the full spectrum of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies due to the central role of tlr in immune regulation 
iss also has an attractive safety profile and is expected to offer fewer side effects as compared to currently available cancer therapies  increasing the likelihood of broad use 
in december  we initiated a phase dose escalation clinical trial of our first generation cancer product candidate in combination with a standard chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer 
in addition  a phase study has been completed in non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl of iss in combination with rituxan tm rituximab 
in december  we announced preliminary data from this phase study based on patients with histologically confirmed cd  b cell follicular nhl who had relapsed after at least one prior treatment regimen for lymphoma 
this study showed a possible correlation between biomarker response to iss and clinical outcomes  patients with high biomarker induction had a doubling of response rate and progression free survival versus patients with low biomarker induction 
the combination of rituximab and our iss was well tolerated  and adverse events were minimal 
we previously reported a phase  dose escalation trial of our iss in combination with rituximab in patients with nhl in which dose dependent pharmacological activity was demonstrated without significant toxicity 
we are also pursuing the development of a second generation iss product candidate offering enhanced potency that could potentially be used for cancer and hepatitis c therapy 
in april  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital partners  lp and certain of its affiliates symphony to advance specific dynavax iss based programs for cancer  hepatitis b therapy and hepatitis c therapy through certain stages of clinical development development programs 
the agreements provided for the formation of symphony dynamo  inc sdi 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony invested million in sdi to fund the development programs  and we licensed to sdi our intellectual property rights related to the development programs 
hepatitis b therapy hepatitis b infection is a major cause of acute and chronic viral hepatitis  with morbidities ranging from asymptomatic infection to liver failure  cancer and death 
currently available therapies for chronic hepatitis b infection include interferon alpha and antiviral drugs 
we are developing a potentially novel therapy to treat chronic hepatitis b infection that combines hepatitis b surface antigen and hepatitis b core antigen 
our 
table of contents hepatitis b therapeutic candidate may provide a more effective alternative for the elimination of infection in chronic carriers  in conjunction with existing antiviral therapies 
our immunotherapy is expected to induce a potent immune response against virus infected cells in the liver and has the potential to eradicate the infection 
in march  we initiated a phase study of this therapy in healthy subjects  to evaluate the safety of the therapy at two dosing schedules 
asthma in most people  asthma is an inflammatory airway disease caused by multiple allergens 
as a result  an approach relying on the linkage of iss to a large number of allergens would be technically and commercially challenging 
to address this issue  we have formulated iss for pulmonary delivery with no linked allergen  relying on natural exposure to multiple allergens that may produce specific long term immunity 
once the immune response to asthma causing allergens has been reprogrammed to a th response  it may be possible to reduce administrations of iss to longer periodic intervals or only as needed 
in addition  based on preclinical data  we believe that this therapy may lead to reversal of airway remodeling caused by asthma 
in september  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca for the discovery and development of tlr agonist based therapies for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd 
the collaboration is using our proprietary second generation tlr agonist immunostimulatory sequences or iss 
under the terms of the agreement  we are collaborating with astrazeneca to identify lead tlr agonists and conduct appropriate research phase studies 
astrazeneca is responsible for any development and worldwide commercialization of products arising out of the research program 
we have the option to co promote in the united states products arising from the collaboration 
autoimmune disorders we have pioneered a new approach to treating autoimmune disease based upon a class of oligonucleotides  named immunoregulatory sequences irs  that specifically inhibit the tlr induced inflammatory response implicated in disease progression 
we are exploring development of an irs based treatment for autoimmune diseases  including systemic lupus erythematosis sle or lupus 
intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio can be divided into our main technology areas iss  vaccines using dna and irs

the regents of the university of california may terminate these agreements if we are in breach for failure to make royalty payments  meet diligence requirements  produce required reports or fund internal research and we do not cure such breach within days after being notified of the breach 
otherwise  the agreements generally continue in effect until the last patent claiming a product licensed under the agreement or its manufacture or use expires  or in the absence of patents  until the date the last patent application claiming a licensed product is abandoned 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies including pfizer  inc  or pfizer  as well as universities and research institutions  may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned or licensed to us 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any products 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
in addition  other parties may duplicate  design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors 
if another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products  we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products 
we have developed second generation technology that we believe reduces many of these risks 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party s proprietary rights 
us patent office interference proceedings may be necessary if we and another party both claim to have invented the same subject matter 
pfizer has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  that  if held to be valid  could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the united states 
we may not prevail in any of these actions or proceedings and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties  or require us to cease using some of our technology 
our policy is to require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us 
manufacturing we rely on a number of third parties and our facility in d sseldorf  germany for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including  for example  iss  a key component material that is necessary for our product candidates  the combination of the antigens and iss  and the fill and finish 
the process for manufacturing oligonucleotides such as iss is well established and uses commercially available equipment and raw materials 
to date  we have manufactured small quantities of our oligonucleotide formulations for research purposes 
we have relied on a single supplier to produce our iss for clinical trials 
heplisav is composed of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with iss 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf  germany to manufacture hepatitis b surface antigen 
in october  we entered into a global license and development collaboration agreement with merck to jointly develop heplisav 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for manufacturing the hepatitis b surface antigen component of the vaccine for merck  which is expected to be produced at dynavax europe s d sseldorf  germany facility 
table of contents using our proprietary technology developed there and later  at our expanded facility to support expected market needs 
tolamba consists of iss linked to amb a  the principal ragweed allergen  which is purified from ragweed pollen purchased on an as needed basis from commercial suppliers of ragweed pollen 
if we are unable to purchase ragweed pollen from commercial suppliers  we may be required to contract directly with collectors of ragweed pollen which may in turn subject us to unknown pricing and supply risks 
as we develop product candidates addressing other allergies  we may face similar supply risks 
in the past  tolamba was produced for us by a single contract manufacturer 
our existing supplies of tolamba are sufficient for us to conduct our current clinical trials 
we may enter into manufacturing agreements with one or more new commercial manufacturers to produce additional supplies of tolamba if required to advance the program toward commercialization 
marketing we have no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
we intend to seek global or regional partners to help us market certain product candidates 
we are inclined to license commercial rights to larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with appropriate marketing and distribution capabilities  except in instances where it may prove feasible to build a small direct sales organization targeting a narrow specialty or therapeutic area 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
many of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions and other research organizations  are actively engaged in the discovery  research and development of products that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development 
heplisav  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with existing  three dose vaccine products produced by glaxosmithkline plc gsk and crucell nv  among others 
there are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis b vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in european union and united states 
in addition  heplisav will compete against a number of multivalent vaccines that simultaneously protect against hepatitis b in addition to other diseases 
tolamba  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with conventional allergy immunotherapy 
conventional allergy immunotherapy products are mixed by allergists and customized for individual patients from commercially available plant material extracts 
because conventional immunotherapies are customized on an individual patient basis  they are not marketed or sold as fda approved pharmaceutical products 
other companies such as alk abello schering plough corporation  allergy therapeutics plc  and cytos biotechnology are developing enhanced allergy immunotherapeutic products formulated for injection  oral and sublingual delivery 
a number of companies  including gsk  merck  and astrazeneca  produce pharmaceutical products  such as antihistamines  corticosteroids and anti leukotriene agents  which manage allergy symptoms 
we consider these pharmaceutical products to be indirect competition for tolamba because although they are targeting the same disease  they do not attempt to treat the underlying cause of the disease 
our universal influenza vaccine  if approved and commercialized  will compete with traditional and emerging influenza vaccines from companies currently marketing these products  including gsk  novartis  sanofi pasteur  medimmune astrazeneca and csl 
in addition  we are aware of several companies developing potentially competing universal vaccines for influenza  including acambis  vaxinnate  merck and vical 
our tlr agonist therapy for cancer  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with other tlr agonist therapies such as those in development by pfizer  inc and idera pharmaceuticals  inc 
in addition  our cancer therapy may compete directly or indirectly with cytotoxic therapies and biologics in development from other parties  including but not limited to amgen  bristol myers squibb  genentech  
table of contents schering plough corporation  and pfizer  inc standards of care can evolve rapidly in oncology and our ability to develop our therapies to be compatible with evolving standards of care will be critical 
our hepatitis b therapy  if developed  approved and commercialized  may compete directly with existing hepatitis b therapeutic products including antiviral drugs and interferon alpha manufactured by roche group  schering plough corporation  gilead sciences  inc  gsk and other companies 
our iss asthma product candidate would indirectly compete with existing asthma therapies  including corticosteroids  leukotriene inhibitors and ige monoclonal antibodies  including those produced by novartis  astrazeneca  schering plough corporation and gsk 
we consider these existing therapies to be indirect competition because they only attempt to address the symptoms of the disease and  unlike our product candidate  do not attempt to address the underlying cause of the disease 
we are also aware of a preclinical inhaled product  which may target the underlying cause of asthma  rather than just the symptoms  which is being developed by sanofi aventis under a collaboration agreement with pfizer 
this product  if approved and commercialized  may compete directly with our asthma product candidate 
many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than us 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly for collaborative agreements with large  established companies and access to capital 
these entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to  or necessary for  our programs 
regulatory considerations the advertising  labeling  storage  record keeping  safety  efficacy  research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the us  pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to rigorous review by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations 
the steps ordinarily required by the fda before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the us are similar to steps required in most other countries and include but are not limited to the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical trials and formulation studies  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication  the submission of a new drug application  or nda  or a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla before any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  us regulatory authorities may fine us  require that we recall our products  seize our products  require that we totally or partially suspend the production of our products  refuse to approve our marketing applications  criminally prosecute us  and or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations 
to secure fda approval  we must submit extensive non clinical and clinical data  manufacturing information  and other supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a product candidate s safety and efficacy 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 

table of contents data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
further  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditures of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve requirements for additional post marketing studies 
the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays experienced during the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies 
delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as result of many factors  certain of which are not under our control  including but not limited to the following lack of efficacy  or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements  including patient enrollment criteria  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements  inability to follow patients adequately after treatment  inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations  and adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance 
non clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda  under its good laboratory practices regulations  regulates non clinical studies 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of those studies  requiring these studies to be replicated 
the results of the non clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  which must be approved by the fda before we can commence clinical investigations in humans 
unless the fda objects to an investigational new drug application  the investigational new drug application will become effective days following its receipt by the fda 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
we must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice under protocols submitted to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application 
in addition  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board and with patient informed consent 
the investigational review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
the stages of the fda regulatory process include research and preclinical studies and clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap 
research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects 
these activities involve identification of potential product candidates  modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity  as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals 
in clinical trials  the product candidate is administered to humans 
phase clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects 
these trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug s safety  determine a safe dose range and identify side effects 
during phase trials  the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat 
phase studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness  to further evaluate dosage  and to identify 
table of contents possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when phase evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective  phase trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population 
if the results of phase trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety  the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for fda regulatory approval of the product candidate 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with fda s general biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
prior to granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet good manufacturing practice requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
in addition  our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda for continued compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
outside the us  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization and pricing or reimbursement approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  marketing authorization  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations may be applied for at a national level  although within the european union registration procedures are mandatory for biotechnology and some other drugs and are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of safety  quality and efficacy 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action

risk factors 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future products  product candidates  development plans  expenses  revenues  liquidity and cash needs  as well as our commercialization plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations 
table of contents and we assume no obligation to update this information 
numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and do not have any commercial products that generate significant revenue 
we have experienced significant net losses in each year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  to date  our revenue has resulted from collaboration agreements  services and license fees from customers of dynavax europe  and government and private agency grants 
the grants are subject to annual review based on the achievement of milestones and other factors and are scheduled to terminate in we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional net losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our investment in research and development activities 
we do not have any products that generate significant revenue 
clinical trials for certain of our product candidates are ongoing 
these and our other product candidates may never be commercialized  and we may never achieve profitability 
our ability to generate revenue depends upon demonstrating in clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective  in particular  in the current and planned trials for our product candidates  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and entering into and maintaining successful collaborative relationships 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we may be required to reduce or discontinue our current and planned operations or raise additional capital on less favorable terms 
if we are unable to secure additional funding  we will have to reduce or discontinue operations 
we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
because of the significant time and resources it will take to develop and commercialize our product candidates  we will require substantial additional capital resources in order to continue our operations  and any such funding may not allow us to continue operations as currently planned 
we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our operations  and any change in plans may increase these outlays and expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some or all of our programs  or discontinue our operations 
the success of our tlr product candidates depends on achieving successful clinical results and regulatory approval 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could require us to discontinue operations 
none of our tlr product candidates have been approved for sale 
any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by foreign regulatory agencies 
our success is primarily dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our most advanced tlr product candidates 
approval processes in the united states and in other countries are uncertain  take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we will need to demonstrate in clinical trials that a product candidate is safe and effective before we can obtain the necessary approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
if we identify any safety issues associated with our product candidates  we may be restricted from initiating further trials for those products 
moreover  we may not see sufficient signs of efficacy in those studies 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval 
for example  we recently announced a clinical hold by the fda on two investigational new drug ind applications for heplisav due to a serious adverse event sae in a phase study 
pending further investigation and resolution satisfactory to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  there can be no assurance that heplisav can be further developed  or even 
table of contents if further development is permitted  that successful clinical development can occur in a timely manner or without significant additional studies or patient data 
many new drug candidates  including many drug candidates that have completed phase clinical trials  have shown promising results in early clinical trials and subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval 
despite the time and money expended  regulatory approvals are uncertain 
failure to successfully complete clinical trials and show that our products are safe and effective would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our clinical trials may be extended  suspended  delayed or terminated at any time 
even short delays in the commencement and progress of our trials may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  which will impair our ability to generate revenues 
we may extend  suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including regulatory actions by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  actions by institutional review boards  failure to comply with good clinical practice requirements  concerns regarding health risks to test subjects or inadequate supply of the product candidate 
in addition  our ability to conduct clinical trials for some of our product candidates is limited due to the seasonal nature 
even a small delay in a trial for any product candidate could require us to delay commencement of the trial until the target population is available for testing  which could result in a delay of an entire year 
our registration and commercial timelines depend on results of the current and planned clinical trials and further discussions with the fda 
any extension  suspension  termination or unanticipated delays of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates  result in significant additional costs  potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products  adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations  receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators  cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate  or limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies  which may be costly 
product approvals  once granted  may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or long term use 
as a result  limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims  or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after commercialization 
in addition  we or our contract manufacturers will be required to adhere to federal regulations setting forth current good manufacturing practice 
the regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and our records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
furthermore  we or our contract manufacturers must pass a pre approval inspection of manufacturing facilities by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies before obtaining marketing approval and will be subject to periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
further  to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products  our ability to control third party compliance with fda requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct 
failure to comply with applicable requirements may also 
table of contents result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution  any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price 
our most advanced product candidates in clinical trials rely on a single lead iss compound  iss  and most of our earlier stage programs rely on iss based technology 
serious adverse safety data relating to either iss or other iss based technology may require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations 
our most advanced product candidates in clinical trials are based on our iss compound  and substantially all of our research and development programs use iss based technology 
if any of our product candidates in clinical trials produce serious adverse safety data  we may be required to delay or discontinue all of our clinical trials 
in addition  as all of our clinical product candidates contain iss  a common safety risk across therapeutic areas may hinder our ability to enter into potential collaborations and if adverse safety data are found to apply to our iss based technology as a whole  we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations 
we rely on third parties and our facility in d sseldorf  germany to supply materials necessary to manufacture our clinical product candidates for our clinical trials and for fulfilling our manufacturing obligations under our collaboration with merck 
loss of these suppliers or key employees in d sseldorf  or failure to timely replace them may delay our clinical trials and research and development efforts and may result in additional costs  delays or significantly higher costs in manufacturing our product candidates or breach of our obligations under our merck collaboration 
we rely on a number of third parties and our facility in d sseldorf for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including  for example  iss  a key component material that is necessary for our product candidates  the combination of the antigens and iss  and the fill and finish 
termination or interruption of these relationships may occur due to circumstances that are outside of our control  resulting in higher cost or delays in our product development efforts 
we and these third parties are required to comply with applicable fda current good manufacturing practice regulations and other international regulatory requirements 
if one of these parties fails to maintain compliance with these regulations  the production of our product candidates could be interrupted  resulting in delays and additional costs 
additionally  these third parties and our manufacturing facility must undergo a pre approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates 
we have relied on a single supplier to produce our iss for clinical trials 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss ourselves for research purposes 
if we were unable to maintain or replace our existing source for iss  we would have to establish internal iss manufacturing capability which would result in increased capital and operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
we or other third parties may not be able to produce iss at a cost  quantity and quality that are available from our current third party supplier 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf to manufacture the hepatitis b surface antigen for heplisav  which is part of our collaboration with merck co  inc  or merck 
we are obligated to manufacture  on behalf of merck  heplisav for clinical development and commercial quantities of hepatitis b surface antigen until such time as we can effect the appropriate technology transfer to merck 
accordingly  we will have to allocate the entire capacity of our d sseldorf facility to meet our obligations under the merck collaboration 
moreover  in order to meet our commercial supply obligations to merck  we expect to have to establish commercial scale manufacturing capability for heplisav  which will involve increased capital and operating costs and the assumption of risks associated with the construction  validation and operation of a new commercial manufacturing facility as well as the continued operation of our existing facility 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully meet our supply obligations to merck and maintain our internal product candidate timelines and  if we undertake the establishment of a new commercial manufacturing facility  that we can finance the capital costs and ongoing expenses that we would need to undertake until or if heplisav 
table of contents achieves commercial success 
there also can be no assurance that the cost of meeting our supply obligation to merck will be covered by the negotiated supply price 
we rely on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines  our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated 
any extension  delay or termination of our clinical trials would delay our ability to commercialize our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
if any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications or marketing claims  we may be unable to generate significant revenues  if any 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and are able to successfully commercialize them  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payors and the medical community 
the fda or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products 
if we are unable to successfully market any approved product candidates  or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits  our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired 
a key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of our product candidates 
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships  which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully  if at all 
we will need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and international sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
we also intend to enter into collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our research and development programs 
the process of establishing collaborative relationships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
moreover  even if we do establish collaborative relationships  our collaborators may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results  a change in business strategy  a change of control or other reasons 
if any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  our research  clinical development or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated  or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator 
if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms  we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates  undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital 
in october  we entered into a collaborative arrangement with merck in which we and merck will further develop and commercialize heplisav 
pursuant to the terms of the collaboration  we are obligated to complete ongoing clinical studies  manufacture and supply on behalf of merck  and conduct technology transfer with respect to our existing heplisav development program 
although we will be reimbursed for specified development efforts and the delivery of clinical material to merck in the further development and commercialization of heplisav  merck controls the development and commercialization plans and timelines for the product 
we recently announced that two ind applications for heplisav have been placed on clinical hold by the fda due to a sae 
as a result of the clinical hold  there can be no assurance that heplisav can continue in further development 
merck may terminate the arrangement upon written notice to us  and there can be no assurance that merck will continue the collaboration regardless of whether or not the clinical hold by the fda is released 
moreover  even if the collaboration continues  we may not successfully and timely fulfill our obligations under the collaboration  merck may develop or market a potentially competitive product  or heplisav  even if successfully developed  may not achieve commercial success sufficient for us to achieve all of the milestones and royalties contemplated under the collaborative arrangement 

table of contents many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do 
if we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors despite these disadvantages we may be unable to generate revenues and our business will be harmed 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations  in developing therapies to treat or prevent infectious diseases  allergy  asthma and cancer  as well as those focusing more generally on the immune system 
competitors may develop more effective  more affordable or more convenient products or may achieve earlier patent protection or commercialization of their products 
these competitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or limit our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
existing and potential competitors may also compete with us for qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as for technology that would be advantageous to our business 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may not be able to obtain financing  enter into collaborative arrangements  sell our product candidates or generate revenues 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  dr 
dino dina 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit  train and retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs  including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as for the establishment of collaborations with other companies 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  our research and product development goals  including the identification and establishment of key collaborations  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed 
we may develop  seek regulatory approval for and market our product candidates outside the united states  requiring a significant commitment of resources 
failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may introduce certain of our product candidates in various markets outside the united states 
developing  seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside the united states could impose substantial burdens on our resources and divert management s attention from domestic operations 
international operations are subject to risk  including the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations  including recruiting and retaining qualified employees  locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community  compliance with varying international regulatory requirements  laws and treaties  securing international distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  adverse tax consequences  
table of contents the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  and regional and geopolitical risks 
if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations  we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  which would impair our ability to generate revenues 
we rely on our licenses from the regents of the university of california 
impairment of these licenses or our inability to maintain them would severely harm our business 
our current research and development efforts depend upon our license arrangements with the regents of the university of california  or uc 
our dependence on these licenses subjects us to numerous risks  such as disputes regarding the creation or use of intellectual property by us and uc  or scientific collaborators 
additionally  our agreements with uc generally contain diligence or milestone based termination provisions 
our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to these provisions could allow uc to terminate our agreements or convert exclusive to non exclusive licenses 
in addition  our license agreements with uc may be terminated or may expire by their terms  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses 
if we cannot maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology 
if third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge the validity of our patents and proprietary rights  we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly  time consuming  and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  or we may be required to enter into litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of our or another party s proprietary rights  including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims 
we are involved in various interference and other administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property which has caused us to incur certain legal expenses 
if we become involved in any litigation and or other significant interference proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others  we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
if we or our collaborators are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against our products  for example  as may arise in the commercialization of heplisav or any similar product candidate in the united states  we or our collaborator could be required to pay substantial damages or be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies without a license from such third party 
a license may require the payment of substantial fees or royalties  require a grant of a cross license to our technology or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third party s patents  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations 
one of our potential competitors  pfizer  has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  or pto  that may be asserted against our iss products 
we may need to obtain a license to one or more of these patent claims held by pfizer by paying fees or royalties or offering rights to our own proprietary technologies in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the us other than with respect to heplisav 
such a license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could preclude or limit our ability to commercialize our products 

table of contents if the combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate  the value of our product candidates will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting united states and foreign patent applications 
however  in certain cases such protection may be limited  depending in part on existing patents held by third parties  which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection 
in the united states  legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain  are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
the biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the united states  where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following we might not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed  the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable  we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage  patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business  other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent  and other parties may design around technologies we have licensed  patented or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights we may be unable to commercialize our products  enter into collaborations  generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors 
our tlr allergy program  including the development of tolamba  relies on debt funding that is accessible only on the achievement of specified development milestones 
we may not be able to achieve the milestones in a timely manner and as a result may not receive or have access to sufficient funding to continue further development of tolamba 
even if we achieve such milestones  we will be obligated to 
table of contents repay up to million in july and we may not have sufficient funds to pay such amounts upon maturity 
in july  we entered into a funding arrangement with deerfield management  or deerfield  to support our further development of our allergy product programs  including tolamba 
our continued access to the funding is dependent upon our successful achievement of specified milestones in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance that tolamba will be entered into planned clinical studies or successfully achieve the planned end points  and failure to successfully further develop tolamba according to our current clinical plans may result in the termination of further development efforts 
moreover  even if we achieve the planned clinical results  we will be required to issue additional warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock and repay outstanding loans to the deerfield 
we may be required to enter into a financing arrangement or license arrangement with one or more third parties  or some combination of these in order to repay the loan at maturity 
there can be no assurance that any financing or licensing arrangement will be available or even if available  that the terms would be favorable to us and our stockholders 
we have licensed some of our development and commercialization rights to certain of our development programs in connection with our symphony dynamo funding arrangement and will not receive any future royalties or revenues with respect to this intellectual property unless we exercise an option to repurchase some or all of the programs in the future 
we may not obtain sufficient clinical data in order to determine whether we should exercise our option prior to the expiration of the development period  and even if we decide to exercise  we may not have the financial resources to exercise our option in a timely manner 
in april  we granted an exclusive license to the intellectual property for certain iss compounds for cancer  hepatitis b and hepatitis c therapeutics development programs to symphony dynamo  inc sdi in consideration for a commitment from symphony capital partners  lp and certain of its affiliates symphony to provide million of capital to advance the development programs 
as part of the arrangement  we received an exclusive purchase option purchase option to acquire all of the development programs through the purchase of all of the equity in sdi during the five year term at specified prices ranging from to million 
the purchase option exercise price is payable in cash or a combination of cash and shares of dynavax common stock  at our sole discretion 
we also received an exclusive option to purchase either the hepatitis b or hepatitis c program program option during the first year of the arrangement 
in april  we exercised our program option for the hepatitis b program 
the exercise of this program option triggered a payment obligation of million which will either be a due to symphony upon the expiration of the sdi collaboration in if the purchase option is not exercised  or b included as part of the applicable purchase price upon exercise of the purchase option 
the intellectual property rights to the remaining cancer and hepatitis c therapy programs not purchased through the exercise of the purchase option will remain with sdi 
we and sdi jointly manage the development programs and there can be no assurance that we will agree on various decisions that will enable us to successfully develop the potential products  or even if we are in agreement on the development plans  that the development efforts will result in sufficient clinical data to make a fully informed decision with respect to the exercise of our purchase option 
if we do not exercise the purchase option prior to its expiration  then our rights in and with respect to the development programs will terminate and we will no longer have rights to any of the programs licensed to sdi under the arrangement 
if we elect to exercise the purchase option  we will be required to make a substantial payment of at least million  increasing thereafter quarterly  which at our discretion may be paid partially in shares of our common stock 
as a result  in order to exercise the purchase option  we will be required to make a substantial payment of cash and possibly issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock 
we do not currently have the resources to exercise the purchase option and we may be required to enter into a financing arrangement or license arrangement with one or more third parties  or some combination of these in order to exercise the purchase option  even if we paid a portion of the purchase price with our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any financing or licensing arrangement will be available or even if available  that the terms would be favorable to us and our stockholders 

table of contents we face product liability exposure  which  if not covered by insurance  could result in significant financial liability 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product s safety and efficacy 
as a result  we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates 
in addition  a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million for each occurrence for clinical trials with umbrella coverage of an additional million 
this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost or at all 
we also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claims  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  would divert our management s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability 
we face uncertainty related to coverage  pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third party payors  which may make it difficult or impossible to sell our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price or the availability of appropriate reimbursement from third party payors 
existing laws affecting the pricing and coverage of pharmaceuticals and other medical products by government programs and other third party payors may change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
because we intend to offer products  if approved  that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease  the willingness of third party payors to reimburse for our products is particularly uncertain 
we will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficiently high to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability and could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims or liabilities relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve 
our research and product development activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
we are currently in compliance with all government permits that are required for the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to persons or property from these materials 
in the event of an accident related to hazardous materials  we could be held liable for damages  cleanup costs or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
our stock price is subject to volatility  and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory efforts  in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  
table of contents our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates  our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own  our ability to enter into and maintain collaborations  maintenance of our existing exclusive licensing agreements with the regents of the university of california  changes in government regulations  general economic conditions  industry announcements  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  and volume of trading in our common stock one or more of these factors could cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because we have experienced greater than average stock price volatility  as have other biotechnology companies in recent years 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may prevent or frustrate a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock with voting rights to be determined by the board of directors  limiting the persons who can call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  providing that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required for amendment to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 

table of contents we will continue to implement additional financial and accounting systems  procedures or controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements 
we are required to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec 
compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or section  and other requirements may increase our costs and require additional management resources 
we may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems  procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to comply with new reporting requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a favorable assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to reach an unqualified assessment  or our independent auditors are unable to issue an unqualified attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which could harm our business and could impact the price of our common stock
