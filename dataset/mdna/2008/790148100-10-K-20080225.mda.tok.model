overview the st 
joe company is one of the largest real estate development companies in florida 
we believe we are the largest private landowner in florida 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida and has a very low cost basis 
in order to optimize the value of these core real estate assets  we seek to reposition our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we increase the value of our raw land assets through the entitlement  development and subsequent sale of residential and commercial parcels  home sites and homes  or through the direct sale of unimproved land 
we have four operating segments residential real estate  commercial real estate  rural land sales and forestry 
our residential real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed home sites to retail customers and builders  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped land  the sale of housing units built by us  rental income  resort and club operations  investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures  brokerage and title issuance fees on certain transactions within our residential real estate developments 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office and industrial uses 
our rural land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land and rural land with limited development 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood  timber and forest products 
since mid through the present  the united states  and florida in particular  have experienced a substantial  continuing decline in demand in most residential real estate markets 
at the same time  the supply of existing homes for sale has risen nationwide  with dramatic increases in florida 
although these weak market conditions have affected sales of all of our residential real estate products  we have experienced the most significant decrease in demand and increase in resale inventories in our resort and seasonal markets 
the downturn in the real estate market is causing prices for residential real estate to decline 
the already weak conditions in the real estate markets are being further exacerbated by problems in the mortgage lending industry  including a lack of mortgage availability and more restrictive lending standards  as well as the current deterioration of national economic conditions 
some economists have already declared that the united states is experiencing a recession which could cause further negative pressure on consumer confidence in housing 
as a result of the dramatic downturn in the residential real estate markets  revenues from our residential real estate segment have drastically declined  which has had an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not know how long the downturn in our real estate markets will last or when real estate markets will return to more normal conditions  but our business will continue to suffer until market conditions improve 

table of contents despite current market conditions  we remain committed to long term value creation 
our ability to obtain land use entitlements for our properties is a key requirement in repositioning our land to higher and better uses and for the generation of revenues 
at the end of  we had land use entitlements in hand or in process for approximately  residential units and million square feet of commercial space  with an additional acres zoned for commercial uses 
we continue to plan and obtain entitlements for an increasingly diverse set of land uses including residential  retail  office  industrial and multi family uses 
in september  we announced that we would streamline operations and exit the homebuilding business  which was primarily completed in further organizational changes and headcount reductions were implemented in january in october  we announced another plan for change in our business with the intent of enhancing and accelerating our value creation process 
the current plan includes the divestiture of non core assets  a significant reduction in capital expenditures  the elimination of quarterly dividends  a smaller operating structure requiring fewer employees and an increased focus on the use of strategic business partners 
the new operating structure consists of a reduced corporate center focused on regional planning  land use entitlements  and business to business relationships with strategic partners and customers who are interested in purchasing entitled land  who can provide development capital for projects and who may help accelerate development activity in our markets 
we have increased our efforts to stimulate regional economic development and to identify and manage key regional inducers 
as a result of the current restructuring plan  we are significantly reducing our employee base to a projected headcount of approximately approximately employees in our hospitality  recreational and golf operations were hired by third party management companies in the fourth quarter of we are continuing to develop our relationships with national  regional and local developers and homebuilders 
we have executed purchase and option contracts with several national and regional homebuilders for the purchase of developed lots in various communities 
these transactions involve land positions in pre development phases of our communities as well as phases currently under development 
these transactions provide opportunities for us to accelerate value realization  while at the same time decreasing capital investment and increasing efficiency in how we deliver primary real estate to the market 
we expect national and regional developers and homebuilders to be important business partners going forward 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical and current experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically probable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest up to total interest expense based on the amount of underlying expenditures and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period such determination is made 

table of contents real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers and amenities  multi family construction costs  capitalized property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  and more frequently if warranted by market conditions or other factors  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and home site sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
although until we had not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins  there can be no assurances that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
construction costs for single family homes are determined based upon actual costs incurred 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized using the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is then recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
percentage of completion accounting is also used for our home site sales when required development is not complete at the time of sale and for commercial and other land sales if there are uncompleted development costs yet to be incurred for the property sold 
our townhomes are attached residences sold individually along with the underlying parcel of land 
revenues and cost of sales for our townhomes are accounted for using the full accrual method 
these units differ from multi family units  in which buyers hold title to a unit or fractional share of a unit or in the case of private residence club prc  a fractional share of a unit within a building and an interest in the underlying land held in common with other building association members 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeded estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i analyzing expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
the fair value determined under these methods can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate and the projected net operating income for a specific property 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 

table of contents intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  lease terms  amortization periods and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
pension plan 
we sponsor a cash balance defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by specialized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension plan s impact on the financial statements of the company 
we engage the services of an independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in less than a million change in pre tax income 
our pension plan is overfunded  and accordingly  generated income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because the pension plan has an overfunded balance  no contributions to the pension plan are expected in the future 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by incorporating the contractual term of the options and analyzing employees actual and expected exercise behaviors 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility in market price over a period consistent with the expected term  and other factors 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we use an estimated dividend yield in the option valuation model when dividends are anticipated 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation

it 
table of contents clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity  not as a liability  in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
the statement also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin as of january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation requires a review of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
and applies a more likely than not recognition threshold 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
as of january  upon the adoption of fin  there was no impact on our financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
eitf states that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified non vested equity shares  non vested equity share units  and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase in additional paid in capital 
the amount recognized in additional paid in capital for the realized income tax benefit from dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies on share based payment awards 
eitf is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we do not believe eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the effective date for fair value measurements of certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fas no 
for the sale of condominiums eitf 
eitf states that 
table of contents in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph d of fas  an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible 
if an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph  including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs of fas  then the entity should apply the deposit method as described in paragraphs of fas eitf is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we have not yet assessed the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements  but believe that we will be required  in most cases  to collect additional deposits from buyers in order to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of eitf  we would be required to recognize revenue using the deposit method  which would delay revenue recognition until consummation of the sale 
we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of sfas statements no

those changes are reported in comprehensive income of a business entity 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas at december  resulted in the recording of an additional million pension asset and an additional million liability related to postretirement medical benefits

difference change difference change dollars in millions revenues real estate sales rental revenues timber sales other revenues total expenses cost of real estate sales cost of rental revenues cost of timber sales cost of other revenues other operating expenses total the decreases in real estate sales revenue and cost of real estate sales for compared to were primarily due to lower sales volume and prices in our residential real estate segment as a result of the current slowdown in the real estate market partially offset by increases in rural land sales 
despite these decreases  our gross margin percentage on real estate sales increased during compared to primarily as a result of a change in mix to higher margin rural land sales 
cost of rental revenues increased for compared to primarily due to shutdown costs related to one of our marinas 
other operating expenses increased in due to a million termination fee paid to a third party management company in our residential real estate segment  partially offset by lower administrative costs subsequent to the restructuring plan in our rural land sales segment 
the compared to decreases in revenues from real estate sales and costs of real estate sales were in each case primarily due to decreased sales in the residential real estate segment and  to a lesser extent  the commercial real estate segment 
the decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of rural land 
the decrease in other revenues and related gross profit of other revenues was primarily due to decreased resale brokerage activity and increased resort costs 
other operating expenses increased in due to increased marketing costs  increased project administration expenses and increased insurance costs in our residential real estate segment 
for further detailed discussion of revenues and expenses  see segment results below 
corporate expense 
corporate expense  representing corporate general and administrative expenses  decreased million  or  to million in over the decrease was partially due to decreases in total stock compensation costs of million 
total stock compensation decreased because the periods included the accelerated amortization of restricted stock related to the retirement of our former president coo  and there were fewer overall share based payment arrangement participants and unvested outstanding stock options in other general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million during compared to the decrease was primarily a result of the completion of our marketing program  reduced litigation costs and overall cost savings initiatives 
corporate expense increased million  or  to million in over the increase was primarily due to increased stock compensation and other compensation costs 
stock compensation costs increased million primarily as a result of the acceleration of restricted stock amortization related to the 
table of contents retirement of our former president coo and stock compensation expense recorded under sfas r 
other compensation costs increased million substantially related to retirement and or severance costs of our former president coo and cfo 
these cost increases were primarily offset by a reduction in bonus expense of million 
impairment losses 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
homes and home sites substantially completed and ready for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
for projects under development  an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is performed using estimated future expenditures necessary to maintain the existing service potential of the project and using management s best estimates about future sales prices and holding periods 
the decline in demand and market prices for residential real estate caused us to conclude that carrying amounts within our residential real estate segment may not be recoverable  and we performed an impairment analysis 
as a result of our impairment analyses  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the residential real estate segment 
we announced on october  our plan to dispose of sunshine state cypress as part of our restructuring plan 
our current estimate of its fair value based upon market analysis indicates that goodwill would not be recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million  including costs to sell  to reduce the goodwill carrying value of sunshine state cypress to zero in the forestry segment in addition to a million goodwill impairment loss in  both of which are reported as part of our discontinued operations 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million to approximate fair value  less costs to sell  related to our investment in saussy burbank which was sold in may  and is reported as part of our discontinued operations 
no impairment losses were recorded in restructuring charges 
restructuring charges include termination benefits and the write off of capitalized homebuilding costs in connection with our exit from the florida homebuilding business and our corporate reorganization 
on october   we announced a restructuring plan that includes the divestiture of non core assets  a significant reduction in capital expenditures  a leaner operating structure and an increased focus on the use of strategic business partners 
as a result  we expect to take a charge to earnings of approximately million  of which million was recognized in  with substantially all of the remaining charges to be recognized in the charges incurred will be primarily termination benefits to employees 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during in connection with our exit from the florida homebuilding business and a corporate reorganization 
the charge included million related to the write off of previously capitalized homebuilding costs and million related to one time termination benefits 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our restructuring reserve 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of investment income  interest expense  gains on sales and dispositions of assets  litigation expense  loss related to the monetization of installment notes and other income 
total other income expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense increased million during compared to primarily as a result of an increase in average borrowings in as well as less capitalized interest 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the net increase includes a receipt of a million insurance settlement relating to the defense of an outstanding litigation matter in partially offset by a writedown of million related to our retained interest of installment notes receivable and million related to a contractor settlement within our residential real estate segment 
in addition  in other  net included a litigation provision of million related to a sales commission dispute 
gain on disposition of assets was million during and represents the gain associated with three of the buildings sold as part of our office building portfolio and in which we had a continuing involvement as lessee 
investment income increased to million in from million in due primarily to higher invested cash balances 
interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding in other  net decreased in primarily due to a litigation provision of million relating to a sales commission dispute 
equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates 
we have investments in affiliates that are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates totaled 
table of contents million in  million in and million in during  we recorded a million equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates related to our investment in alp liquidating trust f k a arvida jmb partners  lp this adjustment was recorded as a result of the trust reserving million of its remaining net assets to satisfy all potential claims and obligations 
equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates also decreased in compared to and compared to primarily due to lower earnings in our investments in residential joint ventures  rivercrest and paseos  which are now sold out 
income tax expense 
income tax expense  including income tax on discontinued operations  totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was higher in primarily as a result of recognizing interest expense on uncertain tax positions as a tax expense 
recently  the internal revenue service irs examined our federal income tax returns for the years through we settled with the irs in march with regards to our contested tax positions 
this settlement resulted in an income tax benefit during the quarter ended march   of approximately million for amounts previously reserved  which lowered our effective tax rate 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include the operations and subsequent sales of our office building portfolio and saussy burbank which were sold in  sunshine state cypress  inc held for sale as of december   four commercial buildings sold in and the sale of advantis and four commercial office buildings in these entities results are not included in income from continuing operations

segment results residential real estate our residential real estate segment develops large scale  mixed use resort  primary and seasonal residential communities 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land near jacksonville  in deland and near tallahassee 
residential sales slowed significantly beginning in mid and market conditions continued to deteriorate during as a result of the slowdown  inventories of resale homes and home sites have risen dramatically in our markets 
through high resale inventory levels continued to negatively impact sales of our products in our markets 
further  the recent highly publicized problems in the mortgage lending industry have led to more restrictive lending standards  which have created additional negative pressure on demand and consumer confidence in housing 
a possible recession in the national economy is also contributing to the continued severe downturn in the residential real estate markets 
at this time  there is much uncertainty as to when the market for residential real estate will improve 
in we recorded impairments totaling million primarily due to current adverse market conditions for residential real estate 
approximately million of the impairments related to capitalized costs at certain projects due to changes in development plans  approximately million related primarily to completed spec homes in several communities and approximately million related to the modified terms of certain promissory notes 
in the past  we devoted significant resources to the conceptual design  planning  permitting and construction process for each of our new communities 
we are continuing this process for certain key projects currently under development  and we will maintain this process for certain select communities going forward 
in the future  however  we will primarily seek to either partner with third parties for the development of new communities or sell entitled land to third party developers or investors 
we hope to achieve significant savings in costs and capital expenditures through this approach to development going forward 
currently  customers for our developed home sites include both individual purchasers and national  regional and local homebuilders 
many of these homebuilders are also experiencing financial difficulties during this current weak real estate market 
as a result  some of these homebuilders are choosing to delay or forego

the gross profit from home site sales decreased to million in from million in due primarily to decreases in the number of home sites closed in summercamp beach  rivercamps on crooked creek  watercolor and watersound beach

the decrease in other revenues and related deficit was primarily due to the decrease in resale brokerage activity and increased resort costs 
the decrease in resale brokerage activity coincided with the slowdown in residential sales

commercial real estate 
our commercial real estate segment plans  develops and entitles our land holdings for a broad portfolio of retail  office and commercial uses 
we sell and develop commercial land and provide development opportunities for national and regional retailers as well as strategic partners in northwest florida 
we also offer land for commercial and light industrial uses within large and small scale commerce parks  as well as for a wide range of multi family rental projects

as a result  our revenues in the commercial real estate segment have steadily declined since in addition to the negative effects of the prolonged downturn in demand for residential real estate  commercial real estate markets are also being negatively affected by the current decline in the national economy 
despite these adverse market conditions  we expect significant interest to develop in the near future for our commercial and industrial properties that surround the site of the proposed panama city bay county international airport 
the new airport is currently under construction and could open for business as early as  subject to the successful resolution of any legal challenges and other construction delays 
we continue to focus our efforts on attracting national and regional retail users and other commercial developers to our properties in northwest florida 
going forward  we will seek to partner with third parties for the development of new commercial projects  as well as sell entitled land to developers and investors

dispositions of assets during the second and third quarters of  we closed on the sale of our office building portfolio  containing buildings with approximately million net rentable square feet  for an aggregate sales price of million 
as discussed earlier  three of the buildings have been reported in continuing operations and the remaining have been reported in discontinued operations 
considering the significant increase in office building valuations in the years prior to the sale  we believe that we achieved optimum pricing for our office building portfolio  especially in light of the subsequent decline in the market for commercial office buildings 
we have no current plans to acquire additional office buildings

cost of sales increased during compared to primarily due to a higher cost basis associated with the sale of our southwest georgia property  which we purchased in in october  we announced that we are marketing for sale approximately  acres that currently fit our criteria for harvesting value 
by december   we closed on the sale of  acres at an average price of  per acre 
the current market for rural land remains steady  and we continue to discuss with potential customers large tract rural land sales

table of contents average sales prices per acre vary according to the characteristics of each particular piece of land being sold and their highest and best use 
as a result  average prices will vary from one period to another 
forestry 
our forestry segment focuses on the management and harvesting of our extensive timber holdings 
we grow  harvest and sell timber and wood fiber 
in addition  we own and operate a sawmill and mulch plant  sunshine state cypress  which converts logs into wood products and mulch

our current estimate of fair value based upon market analysis indicates that its goodwill would not be recoverable 
accordingly  in we recorded an impairment charge of million pre tax which includes million to reduce the goodwill carrying value of sunshine state cypress to zero and million of estimated selling costs 
during  we determined the fair value of sunshine state cypress was less than the carrying value and recorded an impairment loss to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill from million to million 
this resulted in an impairment loss of million pre tax 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations  sales of land holdings  other assets and subsidiaries  borrowings from financial institutions  and issuances of equity from the exercise of employee stock options 
we used cash for operations  real estate development and construction  repurchases of our common stock  payments of dividends  repayments of debt  payments of taxes  and investments in joint ventures and acquisitions 
we have recently announced a restructuring plan designed to significantly reduce our capital investment plans 
we believe our restructuring plan will allow us to increase our financial flexibility over time by significantly reducing capital expenditures  decreasing selling  general and administrative expenses  divesting non core assets  lowering debt and eliminating our current dividend 
management believes we have adequate resources and liquidity to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to our planned level of investment in real estate developments 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows related to assets ultimately planned to be sold  including residential real estate development and related amenities  sales of undeveloped and developed land by the rural land sales segment  our timberland

the expenditures for operating activities relating to our residential real estate and commercial real estate segments were primarily for site infrastructure development  general amenity construction  construction of single family homes  construction of multi family buildings and commercial land development 
for the past three years  we have devoted significant resources to the development of several new large scale residential communities  including windmark beach  rivertown and watersound 
because of adverse market conditions and the substantial progress on these large scale developments  we expect cash expenditures in to be materially less than in also  we expect to realize significant cash savings due to our exit from the homebuilding business 
on august   we purchased the greg norman designed shark s tooth golf club  together with fully developed home sites in the wild heron community  additional land parcels and a beach club  all near panama city beach  florida  for approximately million 
as part of our restructuring plan we intend to limit our capital investments going forward by shifting more development costs to a range of best of class strategic business partners that include branded builders  project developers and venture partners 
capital investment for horizontal developments will be limited to our most strategic and valuable places 
our current income tax payable was million at december  and million at december   respectively 
our net deferred income tax liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the change in our deferred tax accounts was primarily a result of the reversal of deferred tax gains related to the sale of our office building portfolio 
in addition  we made million in tax payments during  which included million related to an irs settlement for the years through in the first quarter of the disposition of our office building portfolio also required us to make significant estimated tax payments during our accrued liabilities were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributed to the settlement of a million tax liability  which was part of our irs examination as discussed above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we sold  acres in southwest georgia 
in connection with this sale we recorded two installment notes in the aggregate amount of million 
these notes were subsequently monetized for million in net cash proceeds 
in addition  we sold  acres in northwest florida 
in connection with this sale we recorded an installment note in the amount of million  which was subsequently monetized for million in net cash proceeds 
selling timberlands using an installment sale structure allows us to defer paying federal income tax on the gain from the sales for years 
we have deferred approximately million of gain for income tax reporting purposes related to these sales 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities include cash flows from the sale of buildings from our office building portfolio  the sale of other assets not held for sale  distributions of capital from unconsolidated affiliates and acquisitions of property using tax deferred proceeds 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in 
table of contents during the second and third quarters of  we closed on the sale of our office building portfolio  containing buildings with approximately million net rentable square feet  for an aggregate sales price of million 
we also defeased approximately million of mortgage debt in connection with the sale 
net proceeds from the sale were used to pay taxes and to pay down debt 
on may   we sold our mid atlantic homebuilding operations  known as saussy burbank 
the sales price was million  consisting of million in cash and approximately million in seller financing 
the remaining balance outstanding on the seller financing at december  was million 
net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay taxes and pay down debt 
on april   we purchased the bay point marina in bay county near panama city beach  florida for approximately million  using tax deferred funds 
net cash provided in primarily was a result of million in proceeds related to the sales of office buildings 
cash flows from investing activities in included million in proceeds from the sales of office buildings and advantis  net of cash included in assets sold 
we used cash in for several real estate investments  including million for the purchase of a commercial office building and related intangible assets net of assumption of a mortgage on the property of million  the purchases of acres of property in manatee county for million and  acres of timberland in southwest georgia for million  in tax deferred like kind exchanges and million of other real estate investments 
the purchase of commercial buildings and land  comprising the majority of the cash used in investing activities  generally follow the sale of real estate  principally land sales on a tax deferred basis 
the tax deferral requires the reinvestment of proceeds from qualifying sales within a required time frame 
we make these investments in buildings and land only when we can acquire these assets at attractive prices 
it is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire assets that meet our pricing and other criteria for reinvestment and  as a result  we may not purchase commercial buildings and vacant land to the extent we have in the past 
additionally  as our sales activity has slowed  the amount of cash available for purchase activities has decreased 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in at december   we had approximately million of debt maturing in less than one year including million under short term libor contracts under our revolving credit facility described below 
in addition  we have a million term loan maturing in july we used the cash proceeds from the sales of our mid atlantic homebuilding operations and office building portfolio to pay taxes and to pay down debt 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we have eliminated our quarterly dividend 
in the future we plan to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program rather than paying a dividend 
the elimination of the dividend will result in annual cash savings of approximately million to million 
as previously discussed  we monetized notes receivable from timberland installment sales in july for million in cash and in november for million in cash 
proceeds from the transactions were used to pay down debt 
our million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility  which matures in july with the ability to extend to july  bears interest based on leverage levels at libor plus an applicable margin in the range of to 
the balance outstanding was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
proceeds from the credit facility have been and will be used for the repayment of debt maturing in  development and construction projects and general corporate purposes 
in july  we entered into a million term loan the term loan to finance the repayment of million of senior notes 
the term loan bears interest on approximately the same terms as our credit 
table of contents facility 
the term loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and in january  we extended the maturity date of the term loan to july  senior notes issued in private placements had an outstanding principal amount of million at december  and million at december  during the first quarter  we paid million related to our series b notes  which matured on february  the proceeds of the senior notes were used to finance development and construction projects  as well as for general corporate purposes 
we have used community development district cdd bonds to finance the construction of infrastructure improvements at six of our projects 
the principal and interest payments on the bonds are paid by assessments on  or from sales proceeds of  the properties benefited by the improvements financed by the bonds 
we record a liability for future assessments which are fixed or determinable and will be levied against our properties 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing  we have recorded as debt million and million related to cdd bonds as of december  and  respectively 
the credit facility  the term loan and our senior notes contain financial covenants  including maximum debt ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage and net worth requirements 
in addition  approximately million of the cdd debt on our consolidated balance sheet at december  is supported by standby note purchase agreements which incorporate the financial covenants of our credit facility 
in june and july we amended the credit facility  the term loan and the senior notes to favorably adjust the financial covenant addressing the fixed charge coverage ratio to provide for a four quarter  instead of a two quarter  calculation 
this change better reflects the variable nature of our quarterly earnings 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility  term loan  senior notes and cdd debt at december  the weak conditions in the residential real estate markets  however  create a challenging environment in which to generate sufficient earnings to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratios of the credit facility  term loan  senior notes and cdd debt 
although land sales should generate sufficient earnings to remain in compliance with these covenants in  we are weighing a number of alternatives to enhance our financial flexibility  including the negotiation of amendments to the credit facility  term loan  senior notes and cdd debt and capital market transactions 
our board of directors has authorized a total of million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock from shareholders from time to time the stock repurchase program  of which million remained available at december  there is no expiration date for the stock repurchase program  and the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available cash  market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
from the inception of the stock repurchase program in to december   we have repurchased from shareholders  shares 
during and  we repurchased from shareholders  and  shares  respectively 
during  as real estate market conditions continued to decline  we chose not to use cash for the repurchase of shares 
given the challenges presented by the current operating environment  we will continue to be prudent in our approach to share repurchase activity until market conditions improve 
as a result  we do not expect to repurchase any shares during executives have surrendered a total of  shares of our stock since in payment of strike prices and taxes due on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock 
for  and   shares worth million   shares worth million and  shares worth million  respectively  were surrendered by executives  of which million  million and million  respectively  were for the cash payment of taxes due on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements if timberlands are sold in exchange for an installment note  the internal revenue code permits the deferral of federal income tax on any gain on the sale until the installment note is paid 
during  we sold a total of  acres of timberland in two separate transactions in exchange for year installment notes receivable in the aggregate amount of million  which installment notes are fully backed by letters of credit issued by a third party financial institution 
we contributed the installment notes to bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose entities qspes established in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the qspes results are not consolidated in our financial statements 
the qspes monetized the installment notes by issuing debt securities to third party investors equal to approximately of the value of the installment notes and distributed approximately million in gross proceeds to us 
the debt securities are payable solely out of the assets of the qspes which consists of the installment notes and the irrevocable letters of credit 
the qspe s investors have no recourse to the company for payment of the debt securities 
we recorded a retained interest with respect to the qspes of million  which value is an estimate based on the present value of future cash flows to be received over the life of the installment notes  using management s best estimate of key assumptions  including credit risk and interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   there was million outstanding under our credit facility  which matures on july  this debt accrues interest at different rates based on timing of the loan and our preferences  but generally will be either the one  two  three or six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a libor margin in effect at the time of the loan 
in addition  we have a million term loan  which matures july and accrues interest based on libor 
these loans potentially subject us to interest rate risk relating to the change in the libor rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
if libor had been basis points higher or lower  the effect on net income with respect to interest expense on the credit facility and term loan would have been a respective decrease or increase in the
