the agreements called for connecticut water and newus to pay a combined million for the assets acquired  which had a book value of million 
on november   the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc issued a final decision approving the transactions and the accounting treatment described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the transaction was completed on january   at which point all of the former customers of eastern became customers of connecticut water 
the acquisition of eastern added more than  residential customers residing in towns across connecticut  some only a few miles from existing connecticut water systems 
the company is currently integrating eastern s customers and employees into connecticut water s operations 
the company expects the integration to be materially complete in the first quarter of for more information  please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  the dpuc approved the company s application to merge unionville water company unionville and crystal water company crystal into connecticut water 
the company completed these mergers on may  in july  the company filed a rate application with the dpuc for the newly merged connecticut water requesting an increase in rates of approximately million  or 
on january   the dpuc issued its final decision and approved a settlement agreement  negotiated with the office of consumer counsel and the dpuc s prosecutorial staff  that allowed connecticut water an increase of revenues of approximately  or 
the settlement agreement allowed connecticut water to defer a portion of the approved rate increase  approximately million 
the company recognized that increase through recording deferred revenues and a corresponding regulatory asset  as required by the decision 
through december   the company has recorded approximately million in deferred revenues 
the second phase of the increase is expected to 
table of contents occur on april  on january   the company filed to reopen the case  a procedure required by the settlement agreement  to implement the second phase 
in addition to the approval for the inclusion in current rates of the previously approved deferred revenues of million  the filing includes requested recovery of the costs associated with million of additional capital investments made in this portion of the second phase of the increase was also called for in the settlement agreement 
the total increase associated with this second phase is a request of  of which approximately is for deferred revenues and for the investment in additional capital in additionally  connecticut water agreed not to apply for a general rate increase that would become effective prior to january  a final decision on this second phase is expected by the end of march our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations 
the demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers high water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers 
demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season  particularly during the warmer months 
in general  the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions 
in addition  profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as costs to comply with security  environmental  and water quality regulations 
inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction  materials and personnel related expenses 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
since the enactment of the safe drinking water act  we have spent approximately million in constructing facilities and conducting aquifer mapping necessary to comply with the requirements of the safe drinking water act  and other federal and state regulations  of which million was expended in the last five years 
we are presently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
connecticut water derives its rights and franchises to operate from special state acts that are subject to alteration  amendment or repeal and do not grant us exclusive rights to our service areas 
our franchises are free from burdensome restrictions  are unlimited as to time  and authorize us to sell potable water in all the towns we now serve 
there is the possibility that the state of connecticut could attempt to revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems 
while we would vigorously oppose any such attempts  from time to time such legislation is contemplated 
the rates we charge our water customers are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by the dpuc 
it is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return 
as noted above  on january   the dpuc approved an increase of revenues of approximately  or  for connecticut water effective january  
table of contents connecticut water s allowed return on equity and return on rate base are and  respectively 
our water systems our water infrastructure consists of noncontiguous water systems in the state of connecticut 
our system  in total  consists of approximately  miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of billion gallons 
the safe  dependable yield from our active wells and reservoirs is approximately million gallons per day 
water sources vary among the individual systems  but overall approximately of the total dependable yield comes from reservoirs and from wells 
as of december   connecticut water s  customers consumed approximately billion gallons of water generating  in revenue 
we supply water  and in most cases  fire protection to all or portions of towns in connecticut 
the following table breaks down the above total figures by customer class as of december   and customers residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total water revenues s residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total customer water consumption millions of gallons residential commercial industrial public authority total includes million of deferred revenues in as allowed under the rate decision 

table of contents connecticut water owns various small  discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes 
at december   this land totaled approximately acres 
over the past several years  we have been disposing of these land parcels 
for more information  please refer to segments of our business below 
additional information on land dispositions can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 
competition connecticut water faces competition from a few small privately owned water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
segments of our business for management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water company with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
during  the company engaged in two land transactions totaling acres and increased its valuation allowance  resulting in a net profit of  in february  the company sold acres of land that were owned by barlaco to the town of barnstable  massachusetts for million 
in  the company sold acres of land in bristol  connecticut for in  the company reduced after tax profit by  by recording a reserve for income taxes 
this was due to an examination by the internal revenue service irs  which was examining the fair market value of the property reflected on the company s  and tax returns 
the irs completed its examination during and no adjustment to the company s tax liability was needed 
as a result  the reserve of  along with an additional  in reserves was reversed in a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows 
table of contents income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while relatively new and a small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provides approximately of our overall net income in net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years  and  respectively 
item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements at pages f to f because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses  however as part of our recent settlement agreement with the dpuc  we have agreed not to request rate relief that would become effective prior to january once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the timing of 
table of contents our future rate increase requests are dependent on the terms of our rate case decision on january  including the second phase of the rate case filed in january and also partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase to the extent approved 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by the dpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a law  the dpuc may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  such as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
the company does not expect to be able to take advantage of the wica mechanism until the first quarter of  at the earliest 
for more information related to wica  please refer to the executive overview found in item of this form k 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  
table of contents or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut has been observed  which we would attribute to the declining household size reported throughout the state  as well as increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the dpuc and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may  thus  have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own dams throughout the state of connecticut 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water distributes water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in 
table of contents sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the dpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
connecticut water has completed three acquisitions since the beginning of through the filing of this report on form k on march  the acquisitions of avery heights  hilldale park homeowner s association  and birmingham s eastern division water systems have increased the company s customer base by approximately  customers 
following these acquisitions  the connecticut water company now serves more than  customers  or a population of nearly  people  in more than connecticut towns 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including in the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the 
table of contents contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ongoing threats to the nation s health and security  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

in certain cases  our water company may be a party to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee simple and or land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant of the company at december  was solely owned by connecticut water 
connecticut water s net utility plant balance as of december  was  nearly million more than the balance of net utility plant as of december   due primarily to normal plant additions 

table of contents sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by connecticut water include eighteen reservoirs and fifty two well fields 
in addition  connecticut water has an agreement with the metropolitan district commission mdc a public water and sewer authority presently serving the city of hartford and portions of surrounding towns  which provides  among other things  for the operation and maintenance by mdc of a filtration plant to supply up to  gallons of treated water per day for connecticut water s collinsville system 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately forty seven million gallons of potable water daily to the fourteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  connecticut water owns  maintains  and operates fourteen small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined have the ability to deliver about one million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
during  the company entered into  and the dpuc approved  a purchased water agreement with the south central connecticut regional water authority rwa to purchase up to one million gallons per day billed at the rwa s wholesale rate 
activation of the interconnection will occur in on an as needed basis 
as part of the dpuc s decision approving the purchased water agreement  they allowed the company to capitalize  per year as the cost to reimburse rwa for capital investments needed to provide for increased water sales 
the company will be allowed to treat these costs as a regulatory asset 
connecticut water owns and operates sixteen water filtration facilities  having a combined treatment capacity of approximately million gallons per day 
the company s estimated available water supply  not including water purchases or non principal systems  is as follows estimated available supply million gallons per day chester system collinsville system danielson system gallup system guilford system naugatuck system northern western system plainfield system somers system stafford system terryville system thomaston system thompson system unionville system total as of december   the transmission and distribution systems of connecticut water consisted of approximately  miles of main 
on that date  approximately percent of our mains were eight inch diameter or larger 
substantially all new main installations are cement lined ductile iron pipe of eight inch diameter or larger

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition executive overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its four wholly owned subsidiary companies the connecticut water company connecticut water  new england water utility services  inc newus  chester realty company chester realty  and barnstable holding company barnstable holding 
in  approximately of the company earnings from continuing operations were attributable to the water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns  as of december  the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
after years without filing rate cases  the company s financial results reflect operations under a new rate structure 
the company has spent considerable time and effort over the past months to ensure that our corporate structure is aligned with our new strategy that will see us requesting rate relief on a more consistent basis in the future 
this is important because of the company s renewed focus on its regulated business as the primary driver of earnings growth and to ensure that we are allowed a fair rate of return on the utility plant that we use to serve our customers 
in an effort to stimulate growth  the company has stepped up its efforts to acquire water companies near our existing service territories 
to that end  the company announced in june that connecticut water entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the regulated water utility assets of eastern connecticut regional water company eastern  a regulated subsidiary of birmingham utilities  inc birmingham 
the acquisition of eastern  which closed on january   added more than  residential customers residing in towns across connecticut  some only a few miles from existing connecticut water systems 
see our regulated business  under item business and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the acquisition of eastern 
in and beyond  the company will continue to look for acquisition candidates that we would easily be able to tuck in to existing service territories  as well as possible acquisitions outside of our service territories  including outside the state of connecticut 
additionally  the company plans to continue its efforts to tie in private well owners whose homes are in close proximity to our mains 
in  connecticut water added customers in our existing service territories 
lastly  the company will continue to work with developers to encourage public water use for new residential construction within connecticut water s service areas 
over the next twenty years  the environmental protection agency expects water companies to spend over billion in infrastructure costs nationwide to ensure compliance with existing and future water regulations 
recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly in wica allows the company to add a 
table of contents surcharge to customers bills  subject to dpuc approval  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments  without a full rate proceeding 
the signing of wica into law in june will help to eliminate the regulatory lag from the time the company invests in replacement  or certain qualified new  plant and when it can begin to recover that investment in the rates charged to customers 
the company  however  does not expect to be able to take advantage of the wica mechanism until the first quarter of while the company plans to file more frequent rate cases  continue to make acquisitions and  in the future  utilize the wica adjustment to increase its earnings through its regulated subsidiary  it will also look to newus to increase its earnings in the unregulated business 
as part of the company s january acquisition of eastern  newus acquired the operation and maintenance contracts of birmingham ho services inc  an unregulated business of birmingham that has nearly contracts for unregulated water systems in eastern connecticut  totaling approximately  in revenues 
the company will continue to seek out maintenance and service contracts with new customers and renew existing contracts that have proven to be beneficial to the company  as well as to continue the expansion of the linebacker program 
regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
connecticut water is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
connecticut water s ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the regulatory rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the dpuc through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the 
table of contents company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements

 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of sfas material regulatory assets  other than deferred revenue  are earning a return 
revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
our water companies accrue an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation

financial condition liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have relied on both internally generated funds and periodic debt and equity issuances in order to fund our construction budget 
looking forward  we expect construction expenditures will be in excess of cash generated from operations and funds generated from the company s dividend reinvestment plan  therefore  we will require additional external debt financings 
we expect that this funding will initially come in the form of interim bank loans  with refinancing into long term debt as the aggregate balance on the interim loans accumulates

the lines of credit have lives that range from to months  which expire during and we expect to renew the lines as they expire
