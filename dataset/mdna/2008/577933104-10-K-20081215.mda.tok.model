you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our revenue and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenue earned on contracts  the timing of revenue on license sales  the timing of revenue on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenue 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  that require the company to make future cash payments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating leases total total contractual cash obligations exclude the potential future cash payments required in connection with potential earn out contingent consideration associated with purchase business acquisitions 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized income tax benefits at september   we are unable to reasonably estimate settlements with taxing authorities 
the above contractual obligations table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million  of which approximately million is related interest expense for fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on income taxes

on july   the company announced that it had retained ubs investment bank as a financial advisor to assist the board of directors in exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including a possible sale of the company 
on november   the company announced that its board of directors had completed its process to explore strategic alternatives and had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock under an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
after a thorough review process  the board of directors concluded that launching a million asr program  concentrating the company s strategic focus on core health and human services offerings and considering alternatives for certain non core assets  provides the best opportunity to maximize shareholder value  reflecting the company s strong financial position and future growth prospects 
in connection with the asr program  the company entered into an asr agreement with ubs investment bank on november  under the asr agreement  the company acquired and retired  shares at an initial price of per share for million plus fees of approximately million 
ubs purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the nine month period ending august  pursuant to the asr agreement  at its completion the company s initial price under the asr agreement was adjusted down based on the volume weighted average price vwap of the company s stock during this period 
such adjustment could be settled in cash or stock at the company s discretion

under a resolution adopted in july  the board of directors has authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to an aggregate of million of the company s common stock 
the resolution also authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
our working capital at september  and was million and million  respectively 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million and no debt  except for lease obligations 
management believes this liquidity and financial position  along with the revolving credit facility discussed below  provides sufficient liquidity to continue any contemplated stock repurchase program depending on the price of the company s common stock  to pursue selective acquisitions  and to consider the continuation of dividends on a quarterly basis 
restricted cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers 

table of contents under the provisions of certain long term contracts  we may incur certain reimbursable transition period costs 
during the transition period  these expenditures resulted in the use of our cash and in our entering into lease financing arrangements for a portion of the costs 
reimbursement of these costs may occur in the set up phase or over the contract operating period 
related revenue may also be deferred during the set up phase 
as of september   million in net costs had been incurred and reported as deferred contract costs on our consolidated balance sheet 
in june  in connection with a long term contract  the company issued a standby letter of credit in an initial amount of up to million  which amount was reduced to million on april  the letter of credit  which expires on march   may be called by the customer in the event the company defaults under the terms of the contract 
the company also has two letters of credit in connection with insurance policies  which total approximately million 
the letters of credit for insurance policies expire in may and automatically renew annually  thereafter 
on january   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility  with suntrust bank as administrative agent  issuing bank and swingline lender  and a syndicate of other lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit commitment  which may be used i for revolving loans  ii for swingline loans  subject to a sublimit of million  and iii to request the issuance of letters of credit on the company s behalf  subject to a sublimit of million

on june   suntrust bank s commitment automatically stepped down from million to million in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
the credit available under the credit facility may be used  among other purposes  to refinance the company s current indebtedness  to repurchase shares of the company s capital stock and to finance the ongoing working capital  capital expenditure  and general corporate needs of the company 
at september   letters of credit totaling million are outstanding under the credit facility 
in july  we entered into a capital lease financing arrangement with a financial institution whereby we acquired assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement 
rental payments for assets leased are payable over a month period at a rate of commencing in january in march  we entered into a supplemental capital lease financing arrangement with the same financial institution whereby we acquired additional assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement 
rental payments for assets leased under the supplemental arrangement are payable over a month period at a rate of commencing in april at september   capital lease obligations of million were outstanding related to these lease arrangements for new equipment 
at september  and  we classified accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  net of a million and million discount  respectively  as long term receivables and reported them within the other assets category on our consolidated balance sheets

we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation as measured by revenue  approximately of our business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business is time and material contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
we generally have been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portions of our contracts are fixed price and performance based and are typically priced to account for the likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that we do not have significant off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies  from federal government agencies  from foreign customers  and from other sources  such as commercial customers 
revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements  including fixed price  performance based criteria  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  and time and materials 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
of the contracts with not to exceed provisions  to the extent we estimate we will exceed the contractual limits  we treat these contracts as fixed price 
for fiscal  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based  and our contracts with the federal government generally have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 
we recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts when earned  as services are provided 
for certain fixed price contracts  primarily systems design  development and implementation  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
for other fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 

table of contents for fixed price contracts accounted for under sop  provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in which such losses become known 
costs related to contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
these costs are generally expensed 
however  certain direct and incremental set up costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized  when such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement 
set up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a client 
the timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit margins 
we recognize revenue on performance based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments 
revenue on cost plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred 
our most significant expense is cost of revenue  which consists primarily of project related costs such as employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
our management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects 
our management s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials contracts 
if actual costs are higher than our management s estimates  profitability may be adversely affected 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer 
we also license software under license agreements 
software revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions sop 
software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non cancelable license agreement  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  there are no significant future performance obligations  the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the license fee is considered probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred and classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as required by sop  the company determines the value of the software component of its multiple element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services  but not for all delivered elements such as the software itself 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
maintenance and post contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from software related consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from other software related contract services requiring significant modification or customization of software is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires contracts with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
we apply the guidance therein and recognize revenue on multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting if the criteria are met 
impairment of goodwill 
we adhere to the financial accounting standards board s statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under these rules  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas and fas goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
annual impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of our reporting units with which goodwill is associated 
losses  if any  resulting from annual impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 

table of contents capitalized software development costs 
software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed and are reported in discontinued operations 
we capitalize both purchased software that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software development projects from the time technological feasibility is established 
capitalized software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
upon the general release of the software to customers  capitalized software development costs for the products are amortized over the greater of the ratio of gross revenues to expected total revenues of the product or on the straight line method of amortization over the estimated economic life of the product  which ranges from three to five years 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment for recoverability of capitalized development costs require considerable judgment by management including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
any changes to these estimates could impact the amount of amortization expense and the amount recognized as capitalized software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company also capitalizes software development costs in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop which are reported in continuing operations 
direct costs of time and material incurred for the development of application software for internal use are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  ranging from three to seven years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
on a regular basis we re evaluate our client receivables  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
if our clients were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
deferred contract costs 
deferred contract costs consist of contractually recoverable direct set up costs relating to long term service contracts in progress 
these costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of us providing service to enable us to provide the contracted services to our customer 
such costs are expensed over the period services are provided under the long term service contract 
we review deferred contract costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer project 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount  we recognize a non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows 
contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings  including contract and employment claims  in the ordinary course of business 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
legal and settlement expense 
legal and settlement expense consists of costs  net of reimbursed insurance claims  related to significant legal settlements and non routine legal matters  including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters 
legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
income taxes 
to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 

table of contents we may also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law  or expiration of a statute of limitations 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions

the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin was a million decrease to the beginning balance of retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheet 
as of september   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards in a subsidiary in canada 
we believe we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards within the expiration period based on an existing contract within this canadian operation 
to the extent that future taxable income from this contract is revised and it is determined that there will be insufficient taxable income generated to utilize all available net operating loss carryforwards  a valuation allowance will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period the determination is made  and the deferred tax assets will be reduced by this amount 
as of september   the company had million of net operating loss carryforwards related to another subsidiary in canada 
a full valuation allowance of million has been established against the related deferred tax asset 
evaluating the net operating loss carryforwards requires us to make certain estimates  which we believe are reasonable 
in the event that actual circumstances differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other market risks with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial
