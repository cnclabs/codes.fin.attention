item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview we are a global provider of information technology it  enterprise support and business process outsourcing services to fortune companies  government entities  multinational companies  product and service providers  and small and medium sized companies 
our business consists of two main components our commercial business and our government business 
together  our it outsourcing services segment  it consulting and systems integration segment and other services segment comprise our commercial business 
our government technology services segment comprises our government business 
in addition to managing our business by service line  we also manage our business by geographic markets the americas defined as north america excluding our government based subsidiaries  europe and government solutions defined as our government based subsidiaries 
together  the americas and europe comprise our commercial business 
nearly three years ago  techteam began to make a transition from being a founder led company to a mature global services organization 
during the past two years  significant strides have been made to establish the foundation necessary for the company s continued strong growth and profitability 
our efforts have included  among other things  pursuing acquisitions  improving our overall execution in areas such as service delivery and new business development  and instilling a greater sense of discipline and accountability throughout the organization 
these initiatives enabled the company to report earnings of per diluted share  an increase of from  and record revenue of million for fiscal revenue grew by almost in from a combination of growth through acquisitions and growth in the base business 
during  revenue from our commercial business grew over  excluding acquisitions  led by over growth in it outsourcing services 
we are extending our global reach in our commercial business by expanding into targeted geographies  and by leveraging the strong relationships that we have with current clients to expand the scope of our services to them globally 
we entered with one global customer defined as a customer that receives services from more than one major geography and exited with four global customers 
we continued our steady expansion of our service capabilities in europe  and began providing support services in three new countries 
moreover  we accelerated our efforts to expand into locations with lower overall cost of providing services 
our strategy to leverage demand creation through alliance relationships continues to develop 
as noted in the third quarter of  techteam global nv sa  the company s belgian subsidiary  was selected for the third time to provide service desk services as a subcontractor of a major european telecommunications provider  and as one of four preferred providers of service desk services in europe to the customers of a major  us based manufacturer of computer equipment 
our focus on improving the efficiency of our service delivery execution and  consequently  the profitability of our projects is evident in our gross margin improvement in our commercial business to in from in our government business also made significant strides during as it grew over primarily due to our acquisition of newvectors llc newvectors on may   and rl phillips  inc rl phillips on august  these acquisitions enhance our competitiveness on larger opportunities by adding greater breadth and scale to our government operations and broadening our capabilities in this market 
newvectors broadens and deepens our department of defense footprint  while adding an enhanced skill set  particularly around logistics modernization  modeling and simulation  and business transformation  and rl phillips adds primarily information assurance services 
we believe that we are now more capable of effectively competing for larger contracts in the government services marketplace with this strengthened value proposition for our customers

results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue year ended december  increase decrease change in thousands revenue commercial business it outsourcing services it consulting and systems integration other services total commercial government technology services total revenue total company revenue increased to million through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth from both new and existing customers across all service lines 
excluding revenue contributed by three acquisitions completed in  total company revenue increased to million 
this organic growth in revenue was over in the commercial business and about in the government business 
revenue from the commercial business in was also favorably impacted by approximately million from the weakening of the us dollar over relative to the international currencies in which we conduct business 
we are unable to predict the effect fluctuations in international currencies will have on our revenue in  but since the euro continues at record levels against the us dollar  there could be significant revenue volatility 
it outsourcing services revenue from it outsourcing services increased to million in  from million in  as a result of revenue growth of in the americas and in europe 
our revenue growth reflects our continuing success at being able to grow existing accounts in our commercial business by expanding the scope of our services and the geographies in which we deliver services 
as noted in the overview  we entered the year with one global customer and exited with four global customers  and we expanded the scope of services we provide to a number of customers 
revenue growth in the americas also reflects greater activity on certain accounts that were ramping up in and a new fortune account added in the fourth quarter of revenue growth in europe also resulted from a combination of new account growth  our acquisition of sqm and the weakening of the us dollar over relative to the international currencies in which we conduct business 
if it outsourcing services revenue in europe were translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate in  reported revenue would have decreased approximately million in since most of our international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross profit is considerably less that the estimated impact on revenue  and it is not significant 
ford is the company s largest commercial customer 
it outsourcing services revenue generated from ford globally decreased to million in  from million in revenue from ford declined over in the americas while revenue in europe increased in each country in which we deliver services to ford resulting in aggregate growth in europe of over

the company has several it outsourcing contracts that expire in  most notably the ford global spoc contract and several accounts in the americas and europe that together comprised of the company s total revenue in while we feel that we are well positioned to renew many of these contracts in  it is not possible to predict the outcome of these renewals or the terms under which the renewals will occur 
notably  two projects comprising about of it outsourcing services revenue in are not renewing their contracts at the end of march it consulting and systems integration revenue from it consulting and systems integration increased to million in  from million in we experienced an increase in revenue in europe of million  or  driven primarily by new and existing customer growth at techteam akela and the acquisition of sqm 
excluding revenue from the acquisition of sqm  revenue in europe increased to million  and revenue globally increased to million 
the increase in revenue in europe was partially offset by a decline in revenue in the americas of from the wind down of certain systems implementation and training projects in our hospitality business 
we anticipate that our business in the americas will increase in over as a result of new projects awarded to us by customers in the hospitality industry 
government technology services revenue from government technology services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to our acquisitions of newvectors and rl phillips 
excluding revenue from these acquisitions  revenue increased to million 
as discussed in our quarterly filings on form q  our government business was adversely affected in by the difficult government contracting environment created by the continuing resolution funding the civilian agencies enacted by the us federal government for fiscal our government business was also impacted by the uncertainty created in funding for our department of defense customers earlier in when the supplemental war funding bill was passed later than anticipated  as they contemplated the need to reallocate funds to support the war effort and delayed procurement decisions 
when the us federal government operates pursuant to a continuing resolution  delays can occur in procurement of products and services  and such delays can affect our revenue  profit and cash flow during the period of delay 
while we experienced delays in customer procurement decisions  revenue from our government business grew in fourth quarter of over the comparable period in please refer to our discussion of the us federal government in the impact of business with major clients section of md a

gross profit growth and gross margin improvement occurred in the americas and included improved performance on two specific accounts  which impaired the america s gross margin during while the accounts were ramping up  and over revenue growth from a major us based customer that is now a global account 
gross profit increased in europe  but gross margin declined primarily due to a contract renegotiation with a customer during the first quarter of  which resulted in new pricing and severance costs relating to reduction of staff  and costs associated with employee recruiting and retention in romania where we have had an increasingly difficult time recruiting qualified employees for specialized requirements  such as german language skills and it infrastructure skills 
accordingly  we are in the process of opening satellite offices in stockholm  sweden  dresden  germany  and sibiu  romania  in order to obtain a better blend of resource skills 
with this site expansion  we believe that we will be able to manage  at a lower cost per technician  the multiple variables that affect the pricing of a globally delivered multilingual service desk including  but not limited to  language distribution  hours of operation and technical skills 
furthermore  we are exploring ways to enhance our ability to provide support in the languages of the asia pacific region while lowering our total cost of labor

the increase in gross profit and gross margin is primarily due to our acquisition of newvectors 
excluding gross profit from acquisitions  gross profit increased slightly and gross margin decreased slightly 
the decline in gross margin from is due to various factors that include hiring additional personnel to support our operations and increasing employee benefits to ensure that we remain competitive in the workplace for attracting the best employees

the increase in sg a expense can be primarily attributed to legal and professional fees associated with responding to a complaint filed by a shareholder costa brava seeking to inspect certain books and records of the company  matters relating to the proxy contest initiated by costa brava related to the election of our board of directors  and the settlement agreement with respect to these matters  costs related to the settlement of claims previously reported by the company that were brought against it by certain former company officers  an increase in board of director fees  including the value of potential equity awards  the acquisition of akela  stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to our annual audit and tax compliance requirements and ongoing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and reduced facility costs as we consolidated offices and allowed certain leases to expire 
net interest income increased to  in  from  in  as a result of earning higher average rates of return on invested cash equivalents

impact of business with major clients we conduct business under multiple contracts with various entities within the ford organization and with various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
ford accounted for of our total revenue in  as compared to in and in the us federal government accounted for of our total revenue in  as compared to in and in no single agency or department of the us federal government comprised or greater of our total revenue in and  however  in the aggregate  approximately of our total revenue in was derived from agencies within the us department of defense 
ford motor company our business with ford consists of service desk and desk side services  technical staffing  network management and a specific project installing personal computers subcontracted through dell inc revenue generated through our business with ford increased to million in  from million in and million in the increase in revenue for is largely due to the weakening of the us dollar against european currencies in which we perform services 
our largest contract with ford is our ford global spoc program  which is currently scheduled to expire at the end of november ford continues to seek cost savings on its total cost of it infrastructure support  and we continue to work with ford during the contract renewal process to find ways to reduce the total cost for our services 
we recently expanded the spoc program to provide spoc services to volvo car company  to whom we used to provide infrastructure support services as a subcontractor 
except for volvo  for whom we billed on an per incident basis  we provide a set of infrastructure support services under specific service level metrics  and we invoice ford based upon the number of seats we support 
the number of seats supported is determined bi annually on december and june of each year 
if certain contractual conditions are met  ford and techteam have the right during each six month period to request one out of cycle seat adjustment 
as a result of ford s corporate restructuring during  we saw a decline in seats supported in the us  however  we saw a increase in seats supported in europe as a result of volvo joining the spoc program in the fourth quarter although we continue to invoice volvo on a per incident basis 
in our work on the contract renewal with ford  we are attempting to offset the anticipated decrease in the price charged for our services with an increase in the number of seats supported and the expansion of the scope of our services 
except for the uncertainty around our continuing to provide services to the jaguar and land rover units  if ford concludes the sale of these units  we believe we are well positioned to expand the spoc program 
we have been informed by ford that certain services that we perform for ford  valued at approximately million in annual revenue  will be transitioned to internal ford staff by the end of the first quarter of as a result of this and other changes in the mix and volume of services provided to ford  it is possible that we may lose of our revenue from ford in  with a small degradation of gross profit margin 
we do not believe that ford s financial condition will otherwise affect our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford  however  any failure to retain a significant amount of business with ford  a bankruptcy filing or other restructuring by ford  would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 
us federal government we conduct business under multiple contracts with various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
revenue generated through our business with the us federal government increased to million in  from million in and million in in years when the us federal government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year  government operations typically are funded pursuant to a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the government to continue to operate  but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives 
when the us federal government operates pursuant to a continuing resolution  delays can occur in procurement of products and services  and such delays can affect our revenue  profit and cash flow during the period of delay 
the results of our government business have been negatively impacted by the difficult government contracting environment created by the continuing resolution enacted by the us federal government in and the delayed passage of the supplemental appropriations bill for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
as a result of this environment  many customers have delayed procurement actions 
as a result  we have experienced delays in our expected new business development 
with the newvectors acquisition  the company now derives a greater portion of its government revenue from short term  project based work 
the uncertainty in government spending makes it more difficult to manage resources 
moreover  in  our contract with the business transformation agency of the department of defense is up for renewal 
revenue from the business transformation agency totaled million for the seven months ended december   since the acquisition of newvectors 
while we believe that  as a member of a team with other contractors  we are well positioned to obtain the renewal  there can be no assurances in this regard 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

noncontrolling interests in financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
these pronouncements are required to be adopted concurrently and are effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited  thus the provisions of these pronouncements will be effective for the company in fiscal the company is evaluating the potential impact of sfas r and sfas on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fasb staff position no 
fas delays the effective date of certain provisions of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million in as a result of million in cash used for acquisitions  million in payments to reduce long term debt and million in cash used for capital expenditures 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million from the issuance of long term debt  million in cash provided by operations and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
operating activities provided cash of million in  which was generated primarily from net income prior to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
this was partially offset by non cash working capital increases of million largely from increases in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased million  net of acquisitions  as a result of over organic revenue growth in and delays in payment remittances from multiple customers 
the company believes the collection delays experienced in the fourth quarter of are temporary and do not represent customer disputes 
operating activities provided cash of million in the increase cash provided by operating activities in was the result of higher net income partially offset by increases in working capital 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in  as a result of acquisitions 
financing activities provided cash of million in  primarily due to the issuance of million in long term debt that was partially offset by payments on long term debt of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  primarily due to payments on long term debt that were partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of company stock options 
long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the continued expansion in europe  new expansion into the asia pacific region  enhancements of existing technologies  additional consideration that is or may become payable to the selling shareholders of previously acquired companies based on specific performance conditions and operating targets  possible repurchases of our common stock and the possible acquisition of businesses complementary to our existing businesses 
we believe that positive cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operational requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future 
we have historically not paid dividends  and we are restricted from doing so under our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na material commitments following are contractual obligations outstanding at december  operating maturities of contractual obligations debt leases less than one year years years thereafter total critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that our critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  goodwill impairment  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment  and business combinations 
revenue recognition under all situations  revenue is not recognized until earned  which is when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided  the revenue terms are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn revenue under our it outsourcing services segment under one of the following four models time and material contracts under which we bill an agreed rate for each help desk agent based on the number of units ie  hours or days the individual agent worked during the month  per transaction contracts under which we bill an agreed rate per incident or call handled during a month or per minute for the length of the telephone call for the incident  fixed monthly fee contracts under which we agree to provide all of the agreed upon scheduled services on a monthly basis for a fixed monthly fee  and per seat contracts under which we agree to provide agreed upon scheduled services for a monthly fee that is determined by multiplying the number of users supported at the customer by the monthly per seat fee 
within the it outsourcing services segment  greater than of our services are delivered as a monthly service and not over multiple periods 
we also refer to our fixed fee and per seat contracts as managed service contracts 
many of our contracts that we bill on a per transaction basis contain a minimum monthly fee  which is derived by multiplying the agreed upon forecast of anticipated incidents by an agreed upon minimum percentage 
under this arrangement  we receive a minimum revenue amount for having committed to provide a specific level of staff to support the services projected during a month 
since we invoice the customer for the minimum fee and do not reduce future billings  we recognize the minimum fee as revenue in the month in which the incidents are below the customer s minimum forecast 
incident resolution usually occurs in the same month that incidents are reported 
under our managed service contracts  we generally do not incur material costs in a future month to complete a service obligation that arose in a prior month 
in those instances where our service obligation is not complete for a month and we expect to incur more than immaterial costs in a future month  we will defer an amount of revenue that represents the fair value of that service obligation 
revenue from all other services that we provide under our other operating segments government technology services  it consulting and systems integration  and other services may be categorized into two primary types time and material and fixed price 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue in these business segments was time and material and were fixed price a substantial majority of which are fixed price level of effort contracts 
revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue is recognized under the majority of fixed price contracts  which are predominantly level of effort contracts  using the cost to cost method for all services provided 
in addition  we evaluate contracts for multiple deliverables  which may require the segmentation of each deliverable into separate accounting units for proper revenue recognition 
our contracts with agencies of the us federal government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work and recognize revenue on unfunded portions of existing contracts based on customer direction pending finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experience with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue is deferred and is not recognized 
we recognize revenue under cost based us federal government contracts based on allowable contract costs  as mandated by the us federal government s cost accounting standards 
the costs we incur under us federal government contracts are subject to regulation and audit by certain agencies of the us federal government 
contract cost disallowances  resulting from government audits  have not historically been significant 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical losses in belgium and romania  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward in these countries 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium and romania 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisitions 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
we are not currently aware of major financial difficulties at any major customer and do not anticipate large uncollectible accounts in the future  however  ford s long term debt rating was lowered to below investment grade status by standard poor s rating services during  and was downgraded further on march   by fitch ratings services 
these downgrades have not negatively affected our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford  however  any bankruptcy filing by ford would have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford and our operating results and liquidity 
goodwill impairment goodwill relating to our acquisitions represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  and has a carrying amount of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in goodwill in was related to the acquisitions of rl phillips  newvectors and sqm 
we completed our annual impairment analyses at october  and  noting no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 
at december   there have been no events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment test should be performed sooner than our annual test each october st 
long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment the carrying amount of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors or events indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to evaluate whether the costs are recoverable 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or contract  decreases in us federal government funding of certain programs  or other similar events 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued using certain software related to our help desk operations 
we expected no future cash flows related to the asset and  therefore  recorded an impairment loss equal to the net book value of the asset of  which was recorded in our it outsourcing services segment 
we did not record an impairment loss in any other period presented 
business combinations we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while costs incurred by us for unsuccessful or terminated acquisition opportunities are expensed when we determine that such opportunities will no longer be pursued 
costs incurred related to probable business combinations are deferred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on june   the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for long term borrowings at variable rates of interest based upon either the london interbank offered rate libor  the bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate  each of which having an applicable interest margin added 
upon entering into the agreement  the company borrowed million to finance part of the acquisition of newvectors 
on june   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to hedge the variable rate of interest on the company borrowings 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a loss of approximately  as interest expense on the interest rate swap 
the company has recorded a liability of  for the fair value of the interest rate swap at december   for which the corresponding offset has been recorded as an unrealized loss within other comprehensive income 
our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk associated with the outstanding loan under the credit agreement 
the market exposure for the variable interest rate on the loan is mitigated by the interest rate swap with a notional amount of million at december  assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and assuming the debt was outstanding since january   interest expense would have increased approximately  in the estimated increase in interest expense was based on the portion of our variable interest debt that was not offset by the interest rate swap agreement and assumes no changes in the volume or composition of the debt 
we did not have any variable rate debt at december  in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results and position could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
also  certain of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
as currency exchange rates change  our operating results will be affected by foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the receivable balance until it is collected 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to trade receivables 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option or forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and european euro 
no derivatives  options contracts or similar instruments were outstanding at december  or we do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately million and million of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries at december  and  respectively  are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
the potential loss on trade receivables from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
