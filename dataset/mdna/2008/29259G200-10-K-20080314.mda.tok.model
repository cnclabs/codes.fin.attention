business strategy our goal is to create value for our investors by increasing reserves  production and cash flow utilizing a balanced approach between exploration  exploitation and acquisitions 
combined with a sound financial discipline  we believe this balanced approach manages risk and results in an achievable and sustainable business plan which will increase shareholder value over the long term 
our north sea focus stems from our belief that the continued restructuring of portfolios by larger energy companies away from the more mature but prolific north sea will create opportunities for smaller companies 
as a result  we expect the region to remain attractive with additional opportunities becoming available as these larger energy companies divest certain north sea assets to focus in other regions and as government authorities continue their push to move unevaluated acreage and undeveloped discoveries into the hands of new  more assertive players 
exploitation exploitation of discovered or acquired reserves is a key part of our strategy 
we believe the north sea benefits from existing infrastructure with ever increasing spare capacity which lends itself to attractive  economically viable approaches to the further development of identified reserves 
we believe our expertise and experience will allow us to develop such opportunities on a cost effective and profitable manner 
our existing producing and discovered assets form a foundation around which we can move aggressively toward exploiting opportunities that we develop whether through exploration or acquisition 
acquisitions in keeping with our business focus  we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of new properties and licenses that expand our current production  exploitation and exploration base  are accretive to shareholder value  provide an attractive rate of return  increase the scope and scale of our operations and offer unrealized reserve potential 
further consolidation of the independent sector in the north sea should also create more opportunities for us to acquire and develop attractive assets and prospects 
in addition  by pursuing strategic acquisitions  we expect to redeploy cash flows from acquired producing assets to fund our exploration drilling program  as well as development of new discoveries 
exploration we also believe the north sea contains significant numbers of new exploration opportunities with material reserve potential and that the existing and available infrastructure in the north sea region further enhances the near term commercial potential of opportunities in this region 
we intend to grow our reserves and production through exploratory activities on our existing acreage  acreage acquired in future licensing rounds and acreage obtained through farm ins and swaps with other industry participants 
these efforts will be aided by our access to the d megasurvey and north sea digital atlas data  compiled by pgs exploration uk ltd  covering the continental shelves of the united kingdom  norway and the netherlands to efficiently and effectively identify new exploration opportunities 

table of contents endeavour international corporation properties at the end of  our exploration portfolio consists of production licenses in the united kingdom sector of the north sea covering approximately million gross acres  approximately million gross acres in the norwegian continental shelf  or ncs  and million gross acres in ireland 
within our acreage position  we have interests in licenses covering eight producing fields in the uk and two producing fields in norway 
as of december   we had proved reserves of  mmcf of natural gas and  mbbls of crude oil  condensate and ngls  for a combined  mboe 
sixty percent of our proved reserves are located in the uk at december   reflecting the enoch and talisman acquisitions in those acquisitions are also responsible for the significant increases in reserves from to as of december   we had the following producing licenses endeavour working field name country operator interest alba united kingdom chevron bittern united kingdom shell brage norway norsk hydro caledonia united kingdom chevron enoch united kingdom talisman goldeneye united kingdom shell ivanhoe  rob roy  hamish united kingdom hess njord norway norsk hydro renee united kingdom endeavour rubie united kingdom endeavour the goldeneye field contributed approximately of our production at  mboe and a quarter of our proved reserves   mboe  at the end of the year 
goldeneye is predominately gas and represented over of our gas production in the njord and alba fields each contributed approximately of our production with and mboe  respectively 
these two fields each had approximately of our proved reserves at december  with  and  mboe at alba and brage  respectively 
while the njord field represented  mboe of our proved reserves at december   its share of our production for was less 
with the completion of the gas export project at njord in december  njord is expected to increase its production in thereby gaining a larger percentage of our total gas production 
since our change in focus to the north sea  we accumulated exploration licenses in the uk  exploration licenses in norway and one in ireland 
our undeveloped acreage covers million gross acres  with approximately each in the uk and norway 
our previous successful exploration activities at columbus and cygnus continue to move forward in development plans and an appraisal well and sidetrack was drilled at the columbus prospect during we expect our exploration efforts in to result in the drilling of at least five prospects 

table of contents endeavour international corporation reserves for  our proved oil and gas reserves were estimated by netherland  sewell associates  inc for  our proved oil and gas reserves in the united kingdom were also estimated by netherland  sewell associates  inc our proved oil and gas reserves in norway for and were estimated by independent reserve engineers 
our internal technical staff  or those of the operator  evaluate all technical data available on each field including production data  wells logs  pressure data  petrophysical analysis  fluid properties  seismic data  mapping based on seismic interpretations and well control along with offset well data to estimate the reserves in place in the reservoir and ultimately estimate the quantity of remaining recoverable proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
we provide our analysis and data to our external reservoir engineers for their independent estimates using the sec definitions of proved reserves 
the external engineers then perform their own analysis of the same raw data including analysis of all production data  pressure data  well logs  petrophysical analysis  fluid analysis  seismic data and mapping based on that seismic data to determine their own reserves in place and ultimately estimate the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved oil and gas reserves at december    and included the following oil gas oil equivalents mbbls mmcf mboe united kingdom norway united kingdom norway norway planned exploration and development expenditures we anticipate spending approximately million during to fund oil and gas exploration and development in the north sea 
an estimated million will be allocated to drilling at least five exploration prospects in the north sea 
approximately percent of this exploration budget will be spent in norway with the balance dedicated to drilling in the uk 
in norway  we expect to drill our first well as an operator with the jade prospect on pl slated to begin drilling during the fourth quarter of the area is the site of the two agat natural gas discoveries and the test will set out to identify additional reserves in support of commercial development 
most of the remaining exploratory wells are outside operated 
some million is expected to be spent for development drilling and facilities improvements to maintain maximum production levels 
another million will fund our efforts in the uk to move the 
table of contents endeavour international corporation cygnus and columbus discoveries toward field development plans and for further exploitation of undeveloped reserves in the renee field on block the timing and order of this program will be determined by the completion of ongoing technical work  partner approvals and rig scheduling for individual prospects 
we may increase or decrease our planned activities for or high grade our exploratory prospects  depending upon drilling results  potential acquisition candidates  product prices  the availability of capital resources  and other factors affecting the economic viability of such activities

company history endeavour international corporation a nevada corporation formed in is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration and development of energy reserves and  since february   we have been geographically focused in the north sea 
in  our operations were focused on oil and gas properties in louisiana  mississippi and oklahoma 
during  we significantly transformed the nature and scope of our business 
on february   we completed a series of transactions that provided a new management team  a new business strategy of exploration  exploitation and acquisition focused on the north sea  the acquisition of nsnv  inc which possessed the seismic data and management team that were central to our new strategy  and a restructuring which resulted in the sale of all our interests in us oil and gas properties 
the transformed company  renamed endeavour international corporation  emerged with a business strategy firmly focused on exploration  production and development in the north sea 
throughout  we made significant strides in our goal to capitalize on opportunities in the north sea 
simultaneous with the restructuring in february  we completed a private offering of common stock for net proceeds of million 
this offering financed the initial transactions in the transformation and provided capital for us to proceed with our business plan for the remainder of throughout and  we sold all remaining us oil and gas properties and our partnership interests in thailand thereby optimizing the assets of our predecessor company in support of our north sea drilling plans and strategy 
in november  we purchased a majority interest in oer oil as oer  a privately held norwegian exploration and production company based in oslo the oer acquisition 
in january  we purchased the remaining interest in oer from twenty four minority interest holders 
through this acquisition  we hold working interests in the agat  brage and njord fields 

table of contents endeavour international corporation in may  we announced our largest acquisition to date the talisman acquisition 
on november   we completed this acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of talisman expro limited for us million  after purchase price adjustments and expenses 
as a result of the talisman acquisition  we acquired interests in eight fields in the united kingdom sector of the north sea and over seven million boe of proved reserves as of the closing date 
the talisman acquisition was financed in four parts million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of for million in gross proceeds   shares of series c convertible preferred stock for million in gross proceeds  million in a borrowing base debt facility  before financing costs paid of million  and million in a second lien term loan  before financing costs paid of million 
in the second quarter of  we purchased an eight percent interest in the enoch field in the north sea for approximately million 
the field is one of the first discoveries to be developed along the median line between the united kingdom and norway after the ratification of the uk norway framework treaty 
while working to complete and integrate these acquisitions  we also moved forward in our drilling program 
during and  we gained approval in the uk and norway to act as an operator or licensee in both countries and began participating in the license round process 
the award of licenses to us in in both the uk and norway allowed us to initiate our multi year drilling program using funds raised by issuing million senior convertible notes in early we ve also pursued various farm in and license transfer opportunities to build acreage and potential and spread the risk of exploration drilling among multiple prospects 
from through  we participated in wells  including five where we served as operator 
together with our partners  we have completed the development project at the enoch field and a project to begin gas production at our njord field 
with the successful exploration drilling at columbus and cygnus  we are working on development plans of both projects and a successful appraisal well and sidetrack was drilled on the columbus prospect in environmental endeavour was established on a commitment to find and develop energy resources in a manner that protects the health and safety of people and preserves the quality of the environment 
adhering to high performance standards in the areas of health  safety and the environment hse is an integral part of the operations of the company in its efforts to end each day injury and incident free 
our operations in the uk portions of the north sea are subject to numerous uk and european union laws and regulations relating to environmental and safety 
environmental matters are addressed both before oil and gas production activities commence and during the exploration and production activities 
before a uk licensing round begins  the department for business  enterprise regulatory reform the dberr previously called the department of trade and industry or dti will consult with various public bodies that have responsibility for the environment 
applicants for production licenses are required to submit a statement of the general environmental policy of the operator in respect of the contemplated license activities and a summary of its management systems for implementation of that policy and how those systems will be applied to the proposed work program 
additionally  the offshore petroleum production and pipelines assessment of environmental effects regulations require the secretary of state to exercise his licensing powers under the uk petroleum act in such a way to ensure that an environmental assessment is undertaken and considered before consent is given to certain projects 
in the norwegian portions of the north sea  our operations are subject to the environmental and safety requirements of the norwegian petroleum act  as well as other laws and regulations 
our 
table of contents endeavour international corporation production licenses in norway incorporate the environmental and safety requirements provided in the norwegian petroleum act  and failure to comply with such requirements can result in the imposition of fines and penalties as well as the potential suspension or revocation of our authorizations to operate 
regulation the exploration  production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental bodies 
applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals  corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located 
as a general rule  parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights 
the terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development 
notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights  the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the manner of development of those rights 
competition the petroleum and natural gas industry is highly competitive 
numerous independent oil and gas companies  oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers  such as drilling companies  upon which we rely 
petroleum and natural gas producers also compete with other suppliers of energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual customers 
competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and or agencies thereof and other factors out of our control including  international political conditions  overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas  and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources 
significant customers our oil sales are to a limited number of customers  each of which account for more than of revenue statoilhydro and shell international trading and shipping company  limited and our gas and natural gas liquids sales are to statoilhydro  shell uk limited and esso exploration and production uk limited 
employees as of march   we have full time employees 
we believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees  none of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward looking statements 
the following material risk factors  among others  may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents endeavour international corporation risks related to our business our ability to produce commercial quantities of oil and gas from our properties may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control 
if we are unable to produce oil and gas from our properties in commercial quantities  our operations will be severely affected 
our business of exploring  developing and producing oil and gas involves a substantial risk of investment loss 
drilling oil and gas wells involves the risk that the wells may be unproductive or that the wells  although productive  do not produce oil or gas in economic quantities 
other hazards  such as unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressures  fires  blowouts  loss of circulation of drilling fluids  or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well 
this could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property 
certain of our operating areas may be subject to severe weather conditions which could adversely impact our operations 
a productive well may become uneconomic if water or other substances are encountered  which impair or prevent the production of oil and gas from the well 
in addition  production from any well may be unmarketable if it is impregnated with water or other deleterious substances 
we cannot assure you that oil and gas will be produced from the properties in which we have interests  nor can we assure the marketability of oil and gas that may be acquired or discovered 
numerous factors are beyond our control  including the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and processing equipment  market fluctuations of prices  taxes  royalties  allowable production and environmental regulations 
we cannot predict how these factors may affect our business 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves which could cause our production and reserves to decline 
our future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves will decline unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration drilling activities 
we have limited control over the availability or cost of drilling rigs and other equipment and services which are essential to our operations  and market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to oil and gas markets or delay production 
we have limited control over the availability and cost of drilling rigs and other services and equipment which are necessary for us to carry out our exploration and development activities 
procuring a sufficient number of drilling rigs is expensive and difficult as the market for such rigs is highly competitive 
the cost of all oil field services has increased significantly during the past year as oil and gas companies have sought to increase production 
there is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services or equipment on a timely basis or that the cost of such services and equipment will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level 
shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations  which could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition or results of operations 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and gas markets  or delay production or increase our expenses 
the availability of a ready market for oil and gas production depends on a number of factors  
table of contents endeavour international corporation including the demand for and supply of oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our debt level could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
as of december   we had million in outstanding indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our operations  including placing restrictions on certain operating activities  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indentures or the terms of our other debt and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to required payments on debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general business activities  decreasing our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged competitors 
we may not have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding debt 
if we are unable to repay our debt out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to pay the interest on our debt or that future borrowings  equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock  a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions  our market value and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering  refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and negatively impact our exploration program 
we have outstanding million of convertible senior notes due upon specified change of control events  each holder of those notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the holder s notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  up to but excluding the date of purchase  plus in certain circumstances  a makewhole premium 
in early  under a private offering  we issued million of guaranteed convertible bonds due to a company controlled by the smedvig family office of norway 
if we undergo a change of control the holders of these bonds have the right  subject to certain conditions  to redeem the bonds and accrued interest 
at december   we also have outstanding million under a secured revolving loan and a letter of credit facility agreement 
an additional million  outstanding under a second lien credit and guarantee agreement  was repaid in january at the same time  we also borrowed million under a junior facility agreement together  the debt agreements 
upon specified change of control events  each lender under the debt agreements may cancel the facility and declare outstanding loans  plus accrued and unpaid interest  outstanding letters of credit and other outstanding fees  if any  due and payable 
we cannot assure you we would have sufficient financial resources to purchase the notes for cash or repay the lenders under our debt agreements upon the occurrence of a change of control 
in addition  events involving a change of control may result in an event of default under other debt we may incur in the future 

table of contents endeavour international corporation variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
certain of our borrowings  primarily borrowings under our bank facilities  are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same  and our net income would decrease 
a change in interest rates would result in a million change in our annual interest expense 
we will not be the operator of all of the interests we own or acquire  and therefore we may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts  the associated costs  or the rate of production of the reserves in respect of such interests 
a significant number of our interests  including several of our producing fields  are located in blocks that we do not currently operate and as we carry out our planned drilling program  we will not serve as operator of all planned wells 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of these interests or their associated costs 
dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects  and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of expected returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside our control  including the timing and amount of their capital expenditures  the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs  drilling equipment  support vessels  production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants to drill wells and implement other work programs  selection of technology  and the rate of production of the reserves 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing or generate sufficient operating cash flow  we may not be able to adequately fund our existing development and exploration projects  acquire additional oil and gas interests  or maintain our rights in such projects 
we may not have an adequate amount of financial resources to adequately fund all of our development and exploration projects 
in the past  we have relied on operating cash flows  credit facility borrowings and the sale of our debt and equity securities to fund the acquisition  exploration and development of our petroleum properties 
we may need to raise additional capital to continue funding these projects and to have the ability to fund additional projects 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available to us for exploration and development of our projects or to fulfill our obligations under any agreements 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of any such financing will be favorable 
failure to generate such additional operating cash flow or obtain such additional financing could result in delay  postponement or cancellation of further exploration and development of our projects or the loss of our interest in our prospects 
we expect to incur substantial expenditures in connection with our oil and gas exploration  development and production activities which may be in excess of operating cash flows and may require us to seek external sources of capital in the future 

table of contents endeavour international corporation competition for oil and gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial  technical and personnel resources that give them an advantage in evaluating  obtaining and developing properties and prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects  acquiring properties  marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors are major or independent oil and gas companies that have longer operating histories in this region and employ superior financial resources which allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources and which better enable them to acquire and develop the prospects that they have identified 
we also actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties 
our relatively small size could adversely affect our ability to obtain new licenses in the future 
specifically  competitors with greater resources than our own can have certain advantages that are particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties 
competitors may be able to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay 
if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future  our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted 
these competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling 
larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  most of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles 
if we are unable to identify additional oil and gas prospects in which we can acquire an interest at an affordable price  we may not be able to grow successfully 
one element of our strategy is to continue to grow through selected acquisitions of additional interests in oil and gas prospects 
this strategy may not be successful  however  because we may not be able to identify additional desirable oil and gas prospects and acquire interests in such prospects at a desirable price  any acquisition of interests in oil and gas prospects may be found not to include prospects that contain proven oil or gas reserves  we may not have the ability to develop prospects that contain proven oil or gas reserves to the point of commercial production  we may not have the financial ability to complete additional acquisitions of interests in oil and gas prospects or to develop the prospects that we acquire to the point of production  and we may not be able to consummate additional acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all 
acquiring interests in properties for oil and natural gas exploration is speculative in nature and may not ever result in operating revenues or profits 
we cannot assure you that we will discover oil and gas in commercial quantities in our current properties or properties we may acquire in the future 
our success depends upon our ability to acquire working and revenue interests in properties upon which oil and gas reserves ultimately are discovered 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we face risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of new properties that expand our current asset base and potentially offer unexploited reserve potential 
this strategy involves risks and we cannot assure you that we will be able to finance or consummate the transactions we select  any acquisitions will be profitable or be successfully integrated into our operations  we will be able to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses  any acquisitions and integrations will not divert management resources  or any acquisitions and integrations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
market fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas could adversely affect the price at which we can sell oil or gas discovered on our properties  and lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write downs 
in recent decades  there have been periods of both worldwide over production and underproduction of hydrocarbons  varying weather patterns and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts 
these conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of  and reduced demand for  crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a regional basis 
these periods historically have been followed by periods of short supply of  and increased demand for  crude oil and natural gas 
the excess or short supply of oil and gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations  even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty future oil and gas prices 
changes in oil and gas prices significantly affect our revenues  operating results  profitability and the amount and value of our oil and gas reserves 
lower prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
in an attempt to reduce our price risk  we may periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties net of related deferred taxes  including estimated capitalized abandonment costs  may not exceed a ceiling limit  which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings as an impairment charge 
this is called a ceiling test write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce net income 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test write downs in the future 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments 
as a result of mergers and acquisitions  at december  we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
although our latest tests indicate that no 
table of contents endeavour international corporation goodwill impairment is currently required  future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability 
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
to manage our exposure to price risk with our production  we entered into commodity derivative contracts 
we may also enter into other commodity derivative contracts from time to time with respect to a portion of our future production to manage our exposure to price risk or exposure to interest rate risk 
the goal of these derivative contracts is to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow 
these transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise over  or interest rates fall below  the prices established by the derivative contracts 
in addition  derivative contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  the counterparties to our contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or gas prices or interest rates 
the use of d seismic is only an interpretive tool and we may be unable to recognize significant geological features 
the use of d seismic is only an interpretive tool and we may be unable to recognize significant geological features due to errors in analysis of data  processing limitations or other factors 
the use of seismic information does not guarantee that the wells we drill will encounter hydrocarbons  or if we do encounter hydrocarbons  that they will be present in commercial quantities 
we operate internationally and are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties 
we currently have operations in the united kingdom  norway and the netherlands 
we may expand our north sea operations to other countries or regions 
international operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the risk of war  acts of terrorism  revolution  border disputes  expropriation  renegotiation or modification of existing contracts  and import  export and transportation regulations and tariffs  taxation policies  including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims  exchange controls  currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations  laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment  and the possibility of being subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states 
the exploration  production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental bodies 
applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
these efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability 
numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to  and have  issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  by constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities 

table of contents endeavour international corporation oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals  corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located 
as a general rule  parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights 
the terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development 
notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights  the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the manner of development of those rights 
our insurance may not protect us against business and operating risks  including the potential that an operator of a prospect in which we participate may fail to maintain or obtain adequate insurance 
oil and gas operations are subject to particular hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and gas  such as blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires and pollution and other environmental risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently operate all of our oil and gas properties 
in the projects in which we own non operating interests  the operator may maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry 
the occurrence of a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance could result in the loss of our total investment in a particular prospect and additional liability for us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the cost of decommissioning is uncertain 
we expect to incur obligations to abandon and decommission certain structures in the north sea 
to date the industry has little experience of removing oil and gas structures from the north sea 
few of the structures in the north sea have been removed 
certain groups have been established to study issues relating to decommissioning and abandonment and how the costs will be borne 
because experience is limited  we cannot precisely predict the costs of any future decommissions for which we might become obligated 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in the reserve estimates or underlying assumptions of our assets will materially affect the quantities and present value of those reserves 
estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions  including price and other economic factors 
in preparing such estimates  projection of production rates  timing of development expenditures and available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data are analyzed 
the extent  quality and reliability of these data can vary 
this process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
if our interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at our reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate  the amount of oil and gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us 

table of contents endeavour international corporation actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from estimates  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to fulfill commitments under any of our licenses  we will lose our interest  and our entire investment  in such license 
our ability to retain licenses in which we obtain an interest will depend on our ability to fulfill the commitments made with respect to each license 
we cannot assure you that we or the other participants in the projects will have the financial ability to fund these potential commitments 
if we are unable to fulfill commitments under any of our licenses  we will lose our interest  and our entire investment  in such license 
we are subject to environmental regulations that can have a significant impact on our operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of national  state  local  and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection  particularly in the united kingdom and norway where our operations are currently concentrated 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties as well as potential orders suspending or terminating our rights to operate 
some environmental laws to which we are subject provide for strict liability for pollution damages  rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances such as oil and gas related products 
aquatic environments in which we operate are often particularly sensitive to environmental impacts  which may expose us to greater potential liability than that associated with exploration  development and production at many onshore locations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly requirements for oil and gas exploration and production activities could require us  as well as others in our industry  to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance which could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with future laws and regulations to the same extent that we believe we have in the past 
similarly  we cannot always precisely predict the potential impact of environmental laws and regulations which may be adopted in the future  including whether any such laws or regulations would restrict our operations in any area 
current and future environmental regulations  including restrictions on greenhouse gases due to concerns about climate change  could reduce the demand for our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to occur 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for activities that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
such liabilities can be significant  and if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents endeavour international corporation governmental regulations to which we are subject could expose us to significant fines and or penalties and our cost of compliance with such regulations could be substantial 
oil and gas exploration  development and production are subject to various types of regulation by local  state and national agencies 
regulations and laws affecting the oil and gas industry are comprehensive and under constant review for amendment and expansion 
these regulations and laws carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  adversely affects our profitability 
in addition  competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and or agencies thereof 
we are dependent on our executive officers and need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel 
our future success depends in large part on the service of our executive officers

although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  there can be no assurance that we will have the ability to retain their services 
further  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any executive officers 
our future success also depends upon our ability to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified technical and other management personnel  who are essential for the identification and development of our prospects

overview we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused in the north sea 
to date  we have invested a significant amount of our resources on various development  acquisition and exploration projects 
over the last several years  we have used three acquisitions to build our base of production  proved reserves and cash flow norwegian assets in late and an interest in the enoch field and eight fields in the uk from talisman in with the completion of these acquisitions  we had a large base of production and cash flow at the end of that provided our first opportunity to operate producing assets 
initial production from the enoch field in mid further added to our production and cash flows from the uk 
the significant trends in the financials represent the impacts and timing of these acquisitions and the related financing  tax and derivative impacts 
while we have grown through acquisitions  we have also maintained a focus on exploration and development programs 
saw the start of our exploration drilling program 
each year we have participated in the licensing round process in the uk and norway and pursued farm in opportunities in order to build our exploration portfolio 
the success of the columbus and cygnus exploration activities in and the purchase of enoch allowed us to move into development activities in late we initiated appraisal drilling at the columbus prospect in that proved successful and completed development activities at the enoch field to allow the commencement of production in mid key items in our drilling and operations in the last three years exploration during the last three years  we ve drilled fifteen exploration wells with four successes in the uk and two in norway  including o cygnus the first of our wells in our drilling program  the cygnus prospect  was spud in early february in the uk sector of the north sea 
the well has successfully tested as a gas discovery and is located within close proximity to several potential 
table of contents endeavour international corporation transportation routes 
we continue to work toward completing the development plan with the other interest owners in the prospect 
o columbus in  we drilled the columbus exploratory prospect in the central graben region of the north sea 
we served as operator of the well 
in december  we completed successful testing of the well 
in  we drilled an appraisal well and its sidetrack effectively confirming the presence of gas condensate bearing sands 
the well is now suspended for possible use in the development of the field 
information obtained from the drilling will be used to further advance development studies  an optimum reservoir depletion scheme and export plans to nearby infrastructure 
enoch we completed the development program and began initial production in mid producing assets at the end of  we completed a project designed to begin gas production at the njord field 
production from goldeneye has continued at levels in above our expectations  indicating the quality of this large gas field 
development drilling has been ongoing at njord  brage and alba to maintain production levels 
results of operations cash flow provided by used in operations was million in versus million in and million in discretionary cash flow was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this significant increase in discretionary cash flow allowed us to repay million in debt while spending million in capital expenditures net loss for was million  or per share  reflecting the significant unrealized loss on the mark to market of commodity derivatives 
for and  net loss was million and million  respectively  or per share and per share  respectively 
the net loss for reflects a significant unrealized gain on the mark to market of commodity derivatives

in connection with the talisman acquisition  we entered into various oil and gas derivative instruments to stabilize cash flows from the acquired assets and satisfy certain obligations under the financing agreements that funded the acquisition 
hedge accounting has not been elected for these instruments resulting in the application of mark to market accounting effectively pulling forward into current periods the non cash gains and losses from commodity price fluctuations relating to all future delivery periods 
when we entered into these contracts  they covered nearly million boe beginning in and running through at a weighted average price of 
as both oil and gas prices fell from the date we entered into the contracts through december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million reflecting the decline in future commodity prices through however  in  commodity price changes reversed their declines  continuing to increase to record levels in the case of oil 
with oil prices reaching nearly per barrel and gas prices recovering to levels close to our original contract prices  we recorded an million unrealized loss in on contract volumes through in  we did receive million in cash on the settlement of instruments that closed during we will continue to have fluctuations in net earnings each period as commodity prices fluctuate based on all remaining unsettled contracts at the end of each period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these derivatives 

table of contents endeavour international corporation revenues  production and operating costs revenues increased from to and again to due to higher market prices and the significant impact of our acquisitions discussed above 
for  and  we had production of approximately  boe per day   boe per day and  boe per day  respectively 
our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
given the current tightly balanced supply demand market  small variations in either supply or demand  or both  can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
while the market price received for oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas  oil trades in a worldwide market  whereas natural gas  which has a limited global transportation system  is subject to local supply and demand conditions 
consequently  price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction 
natural gas prices in the north sea have been influenced by fuel prices around the world with crude oil and coal reaching all time highs 
these prices are also impacted by european gas supplies  particularly deliveries from russian gas supplies 
in addition  regional supply and demand issues affect gas prices 
the majority of our natural gas is sold in the uk market 
market prices for both oil and natural gas were at historically high levels during and oil prices continued their high levels throughout much of north sea gas prices declined in the first quarter of but recovered in the second half of the year and have remained strong 
total operating costs increased from through as a result of the acquisitions discussed above 
operating costs per boe declined for and due to the lower operating costs per boe for our acquired uk properties

the change in income taxes from an expense of million to an expense of million for and  respectively  is primarily the result of the establishment of a tax paying position in the uk upon closing the acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency changes on the deferred tax liabilities 
the change in income taxes from an expense of million in to a benefit of million in resulted from the impact of the mark to market changes on our derivatives and the activity of our uk operations 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million in the us and million corporate tax net operating loss carryforwards and million special corporate tax net operating loss carryforwards in the uk 
table of contents endeavour international corporation in  and  we have not recorded any income tax benefits in the us as there was no assurance that we could generate any us taxable earnings  resulting in a full valuation allowance of deferred tax assets generated 
in addition  we have not recorded any income tax benefits in the uk or the netherlands during as there was no assurance that we could generate any taxable earnings  resulting in full valuation allowances 
as our deferred tax liabilities in the uk  the netherlands and norway are denominated in their respective currencies  we revalue those deferred tax liabilities to the applicable foreign currency exchange rate at the end of each period 
those foreign currency gains and losses are included in income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands december  december  cash restricted cash long term debt debt  net of cash year ended december  amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we have historically funded our operations and acquisitions through issuances of debt and equity securities

table of contents endeavour international corporation as previously discussed  we also sold our partnership interests in thailand to a private entity for net proceeds of approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our debt 
the increased revenues generated by a full year of operations of our acquired assets were primarily responsible for the cash flows provided by operations of million for versus the million used by operations in cash flows used by operating activities were million for as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million for primarily due to higher interest expense in as discussed above and the changes in assets and liabilities between the two periods  partially offset by the higher revenues from the assets acquired in the talisman acquisition 
non gaap measures net income can be significantly affected by various non cash items  such as unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives  currency impact of long term liabilities and deferred taxes 
given the significant impact that non cash items may have on our net income  we use various measures in addition to net income  including non financial performance indicators and non gaap measures as key metrics to manage our business 
these key metrics demonstrate the company s ability to maintain or grow production levels and reserves  internally fund capital expenditures and service debt as well as provide comparisons to other oil and gas exploration and production companies 
these measures include  among others  debt and cash balances  production levels  oil and gas reserves  drilling results  discretionary cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income 
net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow are internal  supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use these non gaap measures as internal measures of performance and to aid in our budgeting and forecasting processes 
we view these non gaap measures  and we believe that others in the oil and gas industry view these  or similar  non gaap measures  as commonly used analytic indicators to compare performance among companies 
we further believe that these non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers  many of which present these measures when reporting their results 
we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance and provide investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes 
since the application of mark to market accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods non cash gains and losses related to commodity derivatives relating to future delivery periods  analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult 
we believe that excluding these unrealized non cash gains and losses related to commodity derivatives and currency exchange changes provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us  investors  analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 
these measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under gaap  and the items excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  operating income  or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity 
because net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow are 
table of contents endeavour international corporation not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and thus susceptible to varying calculations  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow have limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as reported under gaap 
for example  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow may not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  unrealized gains losses on derivatives  non cash foreign currency gains losses  our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debts  our preferred stock dividend requirements  and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
because of these limitations  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow should not be considered as measures of cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and by using net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow only supplementally 
as required under regulation g of the securities exchange act of  provided below are reconciliations of net income loss to the following non gaap financial measures net income as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow 
in thousands  except per share december  net loss depreciation  depletion and amortization impairment of oil and gas properties deferred tax expense benefit unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments amortization of non cash compensation gain on sale of oil and gas assets other discretionary cash flow

outlook drilling program we anticipate spending approximately million during to fund oil and gas exploration and development in the north sea 
an estimated million will be allocated to drilling at least five exploration prospects in the north sea 
approximately percent of this exploration budget will be spent in norway with the balance dedicated to drilling in the uk 
in norway  we expect to drill our first well as an operator with the jade prospect on pl slated to begin drilling during the fourth quarter of the area is the site of the two agat natural gas discoveries and the test will set out to identify additional reserves in support of commercial development 
most of the remaining exploratory wells are outside operated 
some million is expected to be spent for development drilling and facilities improvements to maintain maximum production levels 
another million will fund our efforts in the uk to move the cygnus and columbus discoveries toward field development plans and for further exploitation of undeveloped reserves in the renee field on block the timing and order of this program will be determined by the completion of ongoing technical work  partner approvals and rig scheduling for individual prospects 
we may increase or decrease our planned activities for or high grade our exploratory prospects  depending upon drilling results  potential 
table of contents endeavour international corporation acquisition candidates  product prices  the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting the economic viability of such activities 
we believe we have a production base that generates significant cash flow to fund our future growth plans and ongoing operations 
rig commitments during  we entered into a rig commitment for days for the united kingdom sector of the north sea 
the value of this contact is approximately million 
the arrangement is with applied drilling technology international  a division of globalsantafe 
during  we utilized days of this rig commitment to drill the balgownie and emu prospects 
we expect to utilize the remaining days of this commitment beginning in the third quarter of through depending on well scheduling 
we have a consortium with several other operators in the norwegian continental shelf that has entered into a contract for the use of a drilling rig over a multi year period 
the contract commits us to days for two wells of drilling services for approximately million between mid and revenues and production we expect production for to range from  to  boe per day  with approximately of that production as gas 
for  we expect realized prices before derivatives to be per mcf less than the national balance point price for gas and per bbl less than the dated brent price for oil 
oil prices continued to be impacted by supply and demand on a worldwide basis  while natural gas prices are more impacted by regional economic and weather patterns 
oil prices have continued to increase since year end and natural gas prices in the uk  the market for the majority of our gas production  have recovered significantly due primarily to return to normal weather conditions 
in connection with the talisman acquisition  we entered into commodity derivative instruments to secure our realized prices for a portion of our oil and gas production through see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for more discussion of our commodity derivative instruments 
we expect operating costs per boe to be in the range of to per boe for commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses 
significant commodity price increases  as experienced in recent years  can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities 
as a result  the demand and cost for people  services  equipment and materials may also increase  causing a negative impact on our cash flow 
liquidity and financial resources as previously discussed  we completed the acquisition of producing properties in the uk in late  financed through the issuance of common stock  convertible preferred stock and debt 
this acquisition significantly increased the size of our production and reserves upon closing and should also provide cash flow to support our ongoing exploration drilling program for the next several years 
annual dividends on the convertible preferred stock are expected to be million  assuming we pay the dividends in cash 
the newly issued debt bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million whereby we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor 
in january  we completed the refinancing of certain debt utilizing a strategic investment by the smedvig family office in norway 
included in this refinancing were the repayment of our second lien 
table of contents endeavour international corporation term loan  plus accrued interest  issuance of million under a private offering of guaranteed convertible bonds due  and borrowing of million under a junior credit facility  which will bear interest at the sum of libor  after the first year 
amounts borrowed under the junior facility will be repaid in semi annual payments beginning december  and must be repaid in full on october  the junior facility may be repaid at our option without any penalty 
the smedvig family also committed an additional million for future investments with us 
we expect to have interest expense  including the effect of these new debt agreements  of approximately million annually while paying only million in cash interest 
our income tax expense relates primarily to our operations in the uk statutory income tax rate of and to our operations in norway statutory income tax rate of 
we are currently not able to record income tax benefits on our us loss as there is no assurance that we can generate any us taxable earnings 
further  we are only able to record an income tax benefit on interest expense related to approximately million of our long term debt at an effective income tax rate of 
due to our ongoing drilling program and utilization of deferred tax assets  we anticipate that the majority of tax expense  before foreign currency effects  will be deferred tax expense 
as part of the financing for the talisman acquisition during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a million senior bank facility  subject to a borrowing base limitation 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination every six months with an independent reserve report required every months 
at december   the borrowing base capacity was million  of which million was outstanding 
the senior bank facility also provides for issuances of letters of credit of up to an aggregate million 
while all letters of credit issued under the senior bank facility will reduce the total amount available for drawing under the senior bank facility  letters of credit issued to secure abandonment liabilities in respect of borrowing base assets will not reduce the amount available under the borrowing base 
as of december   we have million of outstanding letters of credit related to abandonment liabilities on certain of our oil and gas properties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and have been presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
these accounting principles require management to use estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of proved reserves  estimates of future dismantlement costs  income taxes and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes it is reasonably possible that the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties  estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs  estimates of fair values used in purchase accounting and estimates of the fair value of derivative instruments 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
table of contents endeavour international corporation full cost accounting under the full cost method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain directly related employee costs and a portion of interest expense  incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas are capitalized and accumulated in pools on a country by country basis 
capitalized costs include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  including the estimated costs of dismantling and abandoning these assets  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs  seismic and other geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and costs related to such activities 
employee costs associated with production and other operating activities and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
capitalized costs are limited on a country by country basis the ceiling test 
the ceiling test limitation is calculated as the sum of the present value of future net cash flows related to estimated production of proved reserves  using end of the current period prices including the effect of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
under the ceiling test  if the capitalized cost of the full cost pool  net of deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling limitation  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
we utilize a single cost center for each country where we have operations for amortization purposes 
any conveyances of properties are treated as adjustments to the cost of oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized unless the operations are suspended in the entire cost center or the conveyance is significant in nature 
unproved property costs include the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development and are not included in the full cost amortization base where proved reserves exist until the project is evaluated 
these costs include unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with interest costs capitalized for these projects 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties where the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
significant unproved properties are assessed periodically for possible impairment or reduction in value 
if a reduction in value has occurred  these property costs are considered impaired and are transferred to the related full cost pool 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not individually significant are aggregated  the portion of such costs estimated to be ultimately nonproductive  based on experience  are amortized to the full cost pool over an average holding period 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  unevaluated property costs remain capitalized in unproved property cost centers until proved reserves have been established  exploration activities cease or impairment and reduction in value occurs 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of a proved reserve base  amounts in the unproved property cost center are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
when it is determined that the value of unproved property costs have been permanently diminished in part or in whole based on the impairment evaluation and future exploration plans  the unproved property cost centers related to the area of interest are impaired  and accumulated costs charged against earnings 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we capitalize interest on expenditures for significant exploration and development projects while activities are in progress to bring the assets to their intended use 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying our weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs and is limited to gross interest expense 
as costs are transferred to the full cost pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the full cost pool 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
in connection with the several acquisitions  we recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our fair value estimates for the acquisition are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by our engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition 
intangible assets represent the purchase price allocation to the assembled workforce as a result of the acquisition of nsnv  inc we assess the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets by testing the asset for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
dismantlement  restoration and environmental costs we recognize liabilities for asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites  offshore production platforms  and natural gas processing plants  with a corresponding increase in the related long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is depreciated along with the property and equipment in the full cost pool 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and accretion expense  recognized over the life of the property  increases the liability to its expected settlement value 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded for both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 

table of contents endeavour international corporation revenue recognition we use the entitlements method to account for sales of gas production 
we may receive more or less than our entitled share of production 
under the entitlements method  if we receive more than our entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability at the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
if we receive less than our entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset at the lower of the current market price or the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
oil revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred  title has transferred and collectibility of the revenue is probable 
derivative instruments and hedging activities from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows from operations or to hedge the fair value of financial instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production or a portion of our variable rate debt to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
these transactions are likely to be swaps  collars or options and to be entered into with major financial institutions or commodities trading institutions 
derivative financial instruments are intended to reduce our exposure to declines in the market prices of commodities that we sell and increases in interest rates and to manage cash flows in support of our annual capital expenditure budget 
regardless of whether the derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge or not  derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recorded at fair market value and included in the balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is not accounted for as a hedge is included in other income expense as an unrealized gain or loss 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at its inception 
where we intend to account for a derivative as a hedge  we document  at its inception  the hedging relationship  the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument  the hedged item or transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  and the method that will be used to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that receive hedge accounting treatment 
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative s fair value 
any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in other income expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion of  or all of  the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents endeavour international corporation in july  the financial accounting standards board issued a new interpretation that seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
this new interpretation also provides guidance on classification  derecognition  interest  penalties and accounting in interim periods and also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
the interpretation was effective for us as of january  our adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
stock based compensation arrangements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised rules that require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted these new rules effective january  using the modified prospective method in which the prior period financial statements are not restated 
the share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method 
we apply the fair value method in accounting for stock option grants to non employees using the black scholes method 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued a new standard which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standards does not require new fair value measurements  rather  its provisions will apply when fair value measurements are performed under other accounting pronouncements 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the standard was deferred for one year as it applies to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis eg those measured at fair value in a business combination and goodwill impairment 
we are reviewing the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
in february  the fasb issued a new standard that permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this standard expands the use of fair value measurement and applies to entities that elect the fair value option 
the fair value option established by the new standard permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued enhanced guidance related to the measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and disclosure of information related to business combinations and their effect 
the standard applies prospectively to business combinations in and is not subject to early adoption 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on business combinations and related valuations 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as a component of consolidated equity 
this is a change from the current practice to present noncontrolling interests in liabilities or between liabilities and stockholders equity 
similarly  the new standard requires consolidated net income and comprehensive 
table of contents endeavour international corporation income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests 
the standard is effective prospectively with respect to transactions involving noncontrolling financial interests that occur on or after january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our obligations and commitments to make future payments under its lease agreements and other long term obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal interest asset retirement obligations operating leases for office leases and equipment rig commitments total contractual obligations repayment of the initial borrowing base on the senior bank facility is based on reserve estimates  which are reassessed every six months 
assumes a libor rate 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we operate in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as rig commitment contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the international scope of our business operations exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to effects that foreign exchange rate movements have on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign 
table of contents endeavour international corporation operations 
our oil revenues are received in us dollars while gas revenues are received in pounds sterling or norwegian kroner 
capital expenditures  payroll and operating expenses may be denominated in us dollars  pounds sterling or norwegian kroner 
we operate a centralized currency management operation to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset exposures against each other 
to date  we have addressed our foreign currency exchange rate risks principally by maintaining our liquid assets in interest bearing accounts  until payments in foreign currency are required  but we have not reduced this risk by hedging to date 
commodity price risk we produce and sell crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional gas spot market prices which have been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
as a result  our financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we may engage in oil and gas hedging activities to realize commodity prices which we consider favorable 
at december   we had the following commodity derivative instruments outstanding amounts in thousands  except unit and per unit data total oil fixed price swap mbbl weighted average price barrel gas fixed price swap mmcf weighted average price mcf costless collar mmcf weighted average ceiling price mcf weighted average floor price mcf net fair market value asset liability oil gas total gas derivative contracts are designated in therms and have been converted to mcf at a rate of therm to mcf 
the exchange rate at december  was to 
at december  and  the prices used to determine the estimates of future cash inflows were and per barrel  respectively  for oil and and per mcf  respectively  for gas 

table of contents endeavour international corporation interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under debt 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million whereby we pay a fixed rate of and receive three month libor through november a change in basis points on libor would result in a million change in our annual interest expense  given our floating rate debt at december  and the interest rate swap
