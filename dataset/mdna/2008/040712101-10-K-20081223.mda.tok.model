item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting period our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest september we report fiscal years under a week format 
this reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year to year comparisons of operating results 
under this method  certain years will contain weeks 
the fiscal years ended september  and september  each included weeks 
overview we have reclassified our consolidated statements of operations data for the prior periods presented below  in accordance with sfas  as a result of the sale of two of our restaurants and the closure of three of our restaurants during the fiscal year ended september   and closure of two of our restaurants during the fiscal year ended september  the operations of these restaurants have been presented as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended september  and september  see item recent restaurant dispositions and charges  item recent restaurant dispositions and note of consolidated financial statements 
revenues total revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal revenues for fiscal were reduced by  and revenues for fiscal were reduced by  as a result of the sale of two facilities and the closure of five of our facilities and their reclassification to discontinued operations 
same store sales increased  or  on a company wide basis from fiscal to fiscal same store sales in las vegas decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal same store sales in new york increased  or  during fiscal same store sales in washington dc decreased by  or  during fiscal same store sales in atlantic city decreased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal same store sales in boston increased  or  during fiscal same store sales in connecticut increased  or  during fiscal other operating income  which consists of the sale of merchandise at various restaurants  management fee income and door sales were  in fiscal and  in fiscal costs and expenses food and beverage cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal and in fiscal total costs and expenses increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased sales 
payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal payroll expense was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  increased sales resulted in an increase in payroll expenses 
we continually evaluate our payroll expenses as they relate to sales 
we typically incur significant pre opening expenses in connection with our new restaurants that are expensed as incurred 
furthermore  it is not uncommon that such restaurants experience operating losses during the early months of operation 
in fiscal  we began operating a mexican restaurant and lounge  yolos  at the rethemed planet hollywood casino in las vegas  nevada  and entered into an agreement to lease space for a yet to be named restaurant at the museum of arts design at columbus circle in manhattan 
the obligation to pay rent for the restaurant at the museum of arts design is not effective until the earlier to occur of the date the restaurant opens for business or mach  we anticipate that investors will invest in the limited liability company that leases the space and such investors will reimburse this limited liability company for all pre opening expenses  we will be the managing member of this limited liability company and  through this limited liability company  we will manage the operations of the restaurant in exchange for a monthly management fee equal to five percent of the gross receipts of the restaurant  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will contribute any capital to this limited liability company  and none of the obligations of this limited liability company will be guaranteed by us and investors in this limited liability company will have no recourse against us or any of our assets 
however  due to the current economic climate  we cannot be certain that such investors will be available 
in such a situation  we anticipate we will contribute capital for pre opening expenses and operate this restaurant through this limited liability company as a subsidiary 
in fiscal  we converted our bar  luna lounge  at the resorts atlantic city hotel and casino in atlantic city  new jersey  into a restaurant  gallagher s burger bar  expanded our operations at the foxwoods resort casino by opening the grill at two trees in the two trees inn  a facility owned by the mashantucket pequot tribal nation and a part of the foxwoods resort casino  in ledyard  connecticut  began construction of yolos  and began operating the durgin park restaurant and the black horse tavern in boston  massachusetts 
we purchased the durgin park facility in from the previous owner for  in cash and a  five year promissory note bearing interest at a rate of per year 
we experienced  and  in pre opening and early operating losses at our facilities in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  were in fiscal and in fiscal we manage two consolidated facilities we do not own el rio grande and the food market at the mgm grand  the tampa and hollywood florida food court operations  and lucky seven at foxwoods 
sales of el rio grande were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
sales of the the food market at the mgm grand were  during the portion of fiscal in which it was open 
the food market at the mgm grand was not open during fiscal sales of the tampa and hollywood florida food court operations were  during fiscal and  during fiscal sales of lucky seven were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal we began an investment program utilizing our large cash balances 
investments are made in government securities and investment quality corporate instruments 
other income  which generally consists of purchasing service fees  equity in losses of affiliates and other income at various restaurants  was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each new york subsidiary on a non consolidated basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary 
for state and local income tax purposes  the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york facilities  which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  in fiscal and  in fiscal our tax return for the fiscal year ended september  is currently under audit by the internal revenue service 
we expect no material adjustments will result from this examination 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations 
we have  from time to time  also utilized equipment financing in connection with the construction of a restaurant and seller financing in connection with the acquisition of a restaurant 
we utilize capital primarily to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  cash was used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of yolos  a mexican restaurant  at the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas  nevada 
cash was also used to purchase investment securities 
cash provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of discontinued operations and the sale of investment securities 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  cash was used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants  converting our bar  luna lounge  at the resorts atlantic city hotel and casino in atlantic city  new jersey  into a restaurant  gallagher s burger bar  opening the grill at two trees in the two trees inn  a facility owned by the mashantucket pequot tribal nation and a part of the foxwoods resort casino  in ledyard  connecticut  purchasing the durgin park restaurant and the black horse tavern in boston  massachusetts from the previous owner for  in cash and a  five year promissory note bearing interest at a rate of per year  and the construction of yolos in las vegas  nevada 
cash was also used to purchase investment securities 
cash provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of discontinued operations and the sale of investment securities 
the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal of  and  in fiscal was principally used for the payment of dividends 
we had a working capital surplus of  at september  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at september  a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share was declared on october  subsequent to october   quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share were declared october and december  and on april  we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to per share on may  and subsequent quarterly cash dividends reflecting this increased amount were declared on october  and january  april  july and october  in addition  we declared a special cash dividend in the amount of per share on december  prior to this  we had not paid any cash dividends since our inception 
we intend to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors 
restaurant expansion during the fiscal year ended september   we expanded our operations at the foxwoods resort casino by opening the food market in the mgm grand casino  a facility part of the foxwoods resort casino  in ledyard  connecticut  began operating a mexican restaurant and lounge  yolos  at the rethemed planet hollywood casino in las vegas  nevada  and entered into an agreement to lease space for a yet to be named restaurant at the museum of arts design at columbus circle in manhattan 
the obligation to pay rent for the restaurant at the museum of arts design is not effective until the earlier to occur of the date the restaurant opens for business or mach  we anticipate that investors will invest in the limited liability company that leases the space and such i investors will reimburse this limited liability company for all pre opening expenses  we will be the managing member of this limited liability company and  through this limited liability company  we will manage the operations of the restaurant in exchange for a monthly management fee equal to five percent of the gross receipts of the restaurant  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will contribute any capital to this limited liability company  and none of the obligations of this limited liability company will be guaranteed by us and investors in this limited liability company will have no recourse against us or any of our assets 
however  due to the current economic climate  we cannot be certain that such investors will be available 
in such a situation  we anticipate we will contribute capital for pre opening expenses and operate this restaurant through this limited liability company as a subsidiary 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
we incurred  in pre opening expenses in fiscal our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
apart from these agreements  we are not currently committed to any projects 
we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
recent restaurant dispositions and charges our bar nightclub facility venus  located at the venetian casino resort  experienced a steady decline in sales and we felt that a new concept was needed at this location 
during the first quarter of  this bar nightclub facility was closed for re concepting and re opened as vivid on february  total conversion costs were approximately  sales at the new bar nightclub facility subsequently failed to reach a level sufficient to achieve the results we required and we have identified a buyer for this facility 
as of december   we classified the assets and liabilities of this bar nightclub facility as held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
based on the fact that the facility has met the criteria under sfas no 
based on the offers made for this facility  we recorded an impairment charge of  during the first fiscal quarter of an additional impairment charge of  was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of as a result of the sale of the facility 
we recorded operating losses of  during the fiscal year ended september  the impairment charges and operating losses are included in discontinued operations 
also during fiscal  we were approached by the venetian casino resort who indicated that  due to the expansion of the grand canal shoppes  our lutece and tsunami locations  as well as a portion of our vivid location  in the grand canal shoppes were desired by other tenants 
the venetian casino resort offered to purchase these locations from us for an aggregate of  after evaluating the offer  we determined that such offer made it advantageous for us to redeploy these assets 
effective december   our subsidiaries that leased each of our lutece  tsunami and vivid locations at the venetian resort hotel casino in las vegas  nevada  entered into an agreement to sell lutece  tsunami and a portion of the vivid location used by lutece as a prep kitchen to venetian casino resort  llc for an aggregate of  our lutece location closed on december  and our tsunami location closed on january  we realized a gain of   after taxes  or per share on the sale of these facilities 
we recorded operating income of  for the fiscal year ended september  the gain on sale and income are included in discontinued operations 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we discontinued the operation of our columbus bakery retail and wholesale bakery located in new york city 
columbus bakery was originally intended to serve as the bakery that would provide all of our new york restaurants with baked goods as well as being a retail bakery operation 
as a result of the sale and closure of several of our restaurants in new york city during the last several years  this bakery operation was no longer profitable 
during the second fiscal quarter of we opened  along with certain third party investors  a new concept at this location called pinch s mac which features pizza and macaroni and cheese 
we contributed columbus bakery s net fixed assets and cash into this venture and received an ownership interest of 
these operations are not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective june   the lease for our stage deli facility at the forum shops in las vegas  nevada expired 
the landlord for this facility offered to renew the lease at this location prior to its expiration at a significantly increased rent 
the company determined that it would not be able to operate this facility profitably at this location at the rent offered in the landlord s renewal proposal 
as a result  the company discontinued these operations during the third fiscal quarter of and took a charge for the impairment of goodwill of  and a loss on disposal of  the impairment charge and disposal loss are included in discontinued operations 
as a result of the above mentioned sales or closures  we allocated  and  of goodwill to these restaurants and reduced goodwill by these amounts in fiscal and  respectively 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 published by the sec  recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of certain accounting policies  which may require us to make estimates and assumptions of future events 
in the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  we estimate the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which are not readily apparent from other sources 
the primary estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable  the useful lives and recoverability of its assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters 
management bases its estimates on certain assumptions  which they believe are reasonable in the circumstances and actual results could differ from those estimates 
long lived assets we annually assess any impairment in value of long lived assets to be held and used 
we evaluate the possibility of impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
if such cash flows are less than carrying value we then reduce the asset to its fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors such as sales growth and operating margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis 
future results could differ from our projections with a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
leases we are obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurants 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets during  the fasb issued sfas  which requires that for us  effective september   goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life  cease amortizing 
sfas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit the company is being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
based on the above policy no impairment charges were recorded during the fiscal years ended and share based compensation effective october  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  and related interpretations and began expensing the grant date fair value of employee stock options 
prior to october   the company applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans 
accordingly  prior to october   no compensation expense has been recognized in net income for employee stock options  as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company elected to value employee stock options using the black scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the company s common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
the assumptions used for the options granted on december   which were unvested at the time of the adoption of sfas r  included a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  a dividend yield of and an expected life of three years 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized during fiscal includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock awards granted prior to october  recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has recently issued the following accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which  among other requirements  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas prescribes a single definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for financial instruments and certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually  sfas is effective beginning the first fiscal year that begins after november   which corresponds to the company s fiscal year beginning september  for all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities the effective date of sfas has been delayed to the first fiscal year beginning after november   which corresponds to the company s fiscal year beginning october  the company is still determining the effect sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements  but it currently does not expect the effect to be material 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits measurement of recognized financial assets and liabilities at fair value with certain exceptions such as investments in subsidiaries  obligations for pension or other postretirement benefits  and financial assets and financial liabilities recognized under leases 
changes in the fair value of items for which the fair value option is elected should be recognized in income or loss 
the election to measure eligible items at fair value is irrevocable and can only be made at defined election dates or events  generally on an instrument by instrument basis 
items for which the fair value option is elected should be separately presented or parenthetically be disclosed in the statement of financial position 
sfas also requires significant new disclosures that apply for interim and annual financial statements 
sfas shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with earlier adoption permitted  if certain conditions are met 
the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value of eligible items existing would be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption  which corresponds to the company s fiscal year beginning september  the company is currently evaluating sfas and determining whether to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination  including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas r will become effective for our fiscal year beginning october in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 sfas  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb no 
 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this standard defines a noncontrolling interest  previously referred to as minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
sfas requires  among other items  that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity separate from the parent s equity  consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statement of income  and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which corresponds to the company s fiscal year beginning october  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting 
the objective of the guidance is to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november   which corresponds to the company s quarterly period beginning december  management is currently evaluating the impact sfas will have on the company s consolidated financial statements  but it currently does not expect the effect to be material 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas  which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new guidance applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions 
under fsp fas  entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension 
fsp fas will require certain additional disclosures beginning october  and prospective application to useful life estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after september  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of fsp fas may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and provides entities with a framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
the current gaap hierarchy has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts  which are subject to the same level of due process as fasb statements of financial accounting standards  below industry practices that are widely recognized as generally accepted but that are not subject to due process 
the board believes the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditors that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
