item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction as a result of the very different characteristics of our two major operating areas poland and us  our financial results show a distinct dichotomy 
our polish operations are early in their initial development and growth phase  while our us operations are relatively mature 
thus  in late  our results began to show substantial changes and improvement 
see results of operations by business segment below 
through  most of our oil and gas production  revenues  and lease operating expenses were attributable to our us operations 
our oilfield service revenues and costs have been and will continue to be exclusively from the us our us operations have historically been the source of essentially all of our operating cash flow 
these operations are relatively stable  with only modest growth or decline on an annual basis 
our operations reflect a major shift for us  as our exploration efforts in poland led to our first meaningful production there commencing in late at that time  we began producing and selling gas from two more of our six commercial discoveries  the wilga and zaniemysl wells 
revenues from our polish properties became the primary component of our revenue in  and will increase further when three more of our commercial wells begin production in and most of our exploration costs during the past several years have been attributable to our efforts in poland 
we expect our polish operations will continue to represent the bulk of our exploration costs  reflecting the nature of our exploration efforts there 
following is a brief discussion concerning certain significant operational and capital events that occurred during and the first quarter of recent operational events as a result of our ongoing drilling and production successes in poland  was a record year for the company in terms of revenues  oil and gas production  and year end proved reserve volumes and values 
change revenues in thousands oil gas sales total revenues production gas production mcf oil production bbls total production mcfe proved reserve volumes gas reserves mcf oil reserves bbls total reserves mcfe proved reserve values gas reserves value in addition to these new benchmarks  we also saw significant improvement in the areas of cash used in operating activities  liquidity cash and working capital  finding and development costs  and per unit operating costs 
all of these improvements are directly tied to the commencement of production in poland in late  as well as the successful completion of two new commercial wells in poland in while we expect most results will remain well above those of and prior periods  we expect to see a decline in oil and gas production and revenues from to this is attributable to our wilga well 
see property impairments for additional information 
however  we expect to see another upward trend in early as we anticipate bringing additional wells in poland into production 
recent capital events common stock offering 
in july  we sold  shares of common stock to certain long term institutional shareholders at a price of per share in a registered direct offering 
after offering costs  the proceeds to us were approximately million 
this funding provided the critical resources for us to accelerate and expand our d seismic program in our core fences area in poland  allowing us to begin a square kilometer extension of the sroda d project 
this d seismic will cover our winna gora new field discovery  as well as a number of additional rotliegend sandstone structures previously identified on d seismic 
field work on the survey began in late warrant exercises 
in february  warrant holders exercised a total of  outstanding warrants at a price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of million 
the warrants were issued in a offering of common stock and warrants and expired as of march new million credit facility 
in november of  we entered into a million senior facility agreement the facility with the royal bank of scotland plc rbs 
we believe our arrangement with rbs is the first onshore gas project financing in poland 
the facility is provided to fx energy poland sp 
z oo  a wholly owned subsidiary of fx energy  inc funds from the facility  which became available to us in march  will cover infrastructure and development costs at a variety of our polish gas projects 
the facility is collateralized by our commercial wells and production in poland and is guaranteed by us 
the facility is significant to us on a number of levels 
first  and foremost  we view the facility as a validation by a respected international financial institution of the value of our reserves  production  and land in poland 
second  it provides us with the ability to leverage our balance sheet and finance the development of our gas projects in poland at a reasonable cost 
third  it provides us with a potentially important initial relationship in the financial community 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our facility 
property impairments wilga 
our wilga well in eastern poland is unique  with no comparable wells to model 
it produces both gas and light crude oil  or lco  or condensate  from three productive zones 
the well began to experience significant water encroachment from one of the productive zones in late  and our production engineering data suggest that we may see a sharp decline in oil and gas production over the course of the next months as a result 
we are currently evaluating alternative methods of sustaining production or slowing the anticipated decline  however  we expect oil and gas revenues in to be adversely impacted from to by lower wilga production than that recorded in as a consequence of the water encroachment  the proved reserves at wilga have been reduced accordingly  resulting in an impairment of capitalized costs in the amount of million in rusocin 
during the second half of  we and pogc drilled the rusocin well  the first well intentionally focused on a stratigraphic trap in the rotliegend 
we believe the well may have discovered commercial quantities of natural gas 
however  our exploration and production focus primarily in the sroda and other areas is to continue in the near term 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we determined to delay steps to place the rusocin well into production as we focus our exploration efforts on the sroda area 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position  accounting for suspended well costs  the capitalized costs associated with this well of million were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production  or e p  segment in poland and the united states  and the oilfield services segment in the united states 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  interest expense  and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
the following table summarizes the results of operations by segment for the years ended december    and in thousands

a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for each of the years presented follows 
further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the consolidated financial statements 
exploration and production segment gas revenues 
as discussed previously  we began gas production in poland during late  and the related gas revenues rapidly became the primary component of our revenue 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to million and in and  respectively 
gas production from our wilga well contributed approximately of our production volumes and approximately of our gas revenues 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for gas revenues  average gas prices  gas production volumes  and lifting costs per mcf for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year na average price per mcf percent change versus prior year na production volumes mcf percent change versus prior year na lifting costs per mcf percent change versus prior year na lifting costs per mcf are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total volume of gas produced 
with the anticipated decline in production discussed earlier at our wilga well  we expect gas revenues in to be lower than those for  but still above those of and earlier 
however  we expect to bring our roszkow well  and possibly other polish wells  into production in and later 
these wells are expected to have a substantial positive impact on future production and revenues 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
included in and revenues were approximately million and  respectively  related to the sale of lco in poland at our wilga well 
with the anticipated decline in production discussed earlier at our wilga well  we expect lco revenues in to be significantly reduced 
all other oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices and changing production rates that are a function of normal production declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
lco lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between oil and gas 
lifting costs include production taxes incurred in the united states 
depending largely upon future oil prices  we expect that and future oil revenues will be fairly stable compared to the future changes expected for gas revenues 
we do not expect major oil production changes similar to those for future gas production 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in  and million in the higher costs in are reflective of a full year s production in poland 
poland operating costs rose from  in to million in operating costs rose slightly from to as we commenced gas and lco production at our wilga well in poland 
lease operating costs at our kleka and zaniemysl wells were not significant in we also recompleted nine producing wells in montana during exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs as well as the costs of exploratory dry holes 
exploration costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing  and interpreting new seismic data on the fences i and ii areas  including our new d seismic survey in the sroda area which began shooting in late  and on which we spent a total of million in exploratory dry hole costs were  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  both of the wells we drilled in poland were determined to be commercial  and were completed for future production 
our exploration costs included approximately  associated with the drozdowice well in our fences iii prospect in poland  along with additional amounts for two dry holes in montana and nevada 
during  we plugged and abandoned two wells in poland  the sroda and lugi wells  for a total cost of approximately million 
in addition  we plugged and abandoned four exploratory wells in nevada for a total cost of approximately  since different types of future exploration costs may either be capitalized and depleted  or written off altogether  depending upon future exploration results  it is not possible to provide especially meaningful forward looking thoughts on these expenses 
however  the capital budget is substantially above that of  which would indicate exploration costs might well be higher in the future 
impairment costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties were million  million  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as discussed previously  during we impaired million related to our wilga well  and in we impaired the entire amount of capitalized costs associated with our rusocin well 
there were no similar impairments during dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to was a reflection of a full year s worth of production in poland  discussed earlier 
dd a expense in poland was  in the increase from to was due primarily to the commencement of production at our properties in poland  which accounted for  of the  increase 
the remaining increase is due to capital cost additions in at our montana producing properties 
future dd a costs are expected to generally  but not completely  follow future production trends 
however  future dd a rates can be very different depending upon future capitalized costs 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
activity in the contract drilling industry where we operate increased significantly during  slowed somewhat in  and increased again in oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during   and respectively 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
higher employee compensation costs in  associated in part with an expansion of our poland operations office  coupled with higher legal  insurance  and software maintenance costs  resulted in an increase in g a of million 
during  we significantly reduced from levels legal and consulting fees  reducing our g a by approximately  decreases in other g a areas were offset to some extent by higher employee costs  as we increased headcount in our poland office 
during  we opened a new office in warsaw  poland  hiring five experienced individuals to assist in our expanding exploration and production efforts 
stock compensation g a 
stock compensation expense recorded in represents the amortization of stock and options issued to consultants prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
amortization of deferred compensation g a 
as discussed above  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective method 
under this method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
stock based awards that were granted prior to the effective date continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and and  of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to  using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in and and million of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to  using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
interest and other income expense corporate 
interest and other income expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we began to amortize the fees incurred in securing our senior credit facility to interest expense as well as the semi annual commitment fees for the facility  totaling  in interest related charges 
these charges offset interest income of  an increase over levels due to higher cash balances available for investment 
the increase in interest income for to was also due to higher cash balances generally available for investment over the prior year  coupled with rising interest rates 
income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
we believe our cash resources and marketable securities at december   together with anticipated revenues in and availability under our million senior facility agreement  are sufficient to cover our planned exploration program and ongoing operations in the united states and poland for the next months 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  project financing to help finance the completion of successful wells  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we will allocate our existing capital as well as funds we may obtain in the future among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition  and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   an increase of million from december  the increase is due primarily to the proceeds of an equity financing during  offset by costs associated with our drilling and seismic activities during the exercise of warrants in early as discussed above has further improved working capital 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million  and million in our operating activities during   and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
revenues from oil and gas sales in poland  which commenced in late  helped us reduce the amount of cash used in operations in both and our current assets at year end included approximately million in accrued oil and gas sales from both the united states and poland  and  in refundable input vat that we expect to receive during the first six months of our current liabilities at year end included approximately  in costs related to our exploration activities in poland that were paid in early investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million in and received net cash from investing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
in we received million from the maturities of marketable securities 
we invested million in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in we received million from the maturities of marketable securities 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in we received million from the sale of marketable securities and million from the recovery of previously capitalized input vat 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  upgrading our oilfield services equipment 
financing activities 
we received net cash from financing activities of million in  used net cash in financing activities of  in  and received net cash of million from our financing activities during during  we sold million shares of stock in a registered direct offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
in addition   options and warrants were exercised during the year  resulting in proceeds to us of an additional million 
all the cash used in financing activities in was used to pay the loan origination fees and associated legal costs related to our million senior credit facility 
all of the proceeds in were from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
in addition  the exercise of warrants and options provided additional proceeds of million 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we had no significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december  we are subject to certain work commitments with respect to our exploration concessions that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
these work commitments are  however  optional on our part 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling  and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not re measured at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  any amounts recognized upon adoption of this rule as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we have evaluated sfas no 
and have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which permits an entity to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
an entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years that begin after november  we have evaluated sfas no 
and have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and we have not early adopted 
we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
revenues associated with oil and gas sales are recorded when title passes  which is upon delivery to the pipeline or purchaser  and are net of royalties 
oilfield service revenues are recognized when the related service is performed 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining dd a expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
dd a rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our dd a expense 
also  estimated reserves are used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no

under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states and poland is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
our gas in poland is sold to pogc or its subsidiaries under contracts that extend for the life of each field 
prices are determined contractually and  in the case of our wilga and zaniemysl wells  are tied to published tariffs 
gas sold at kleka is sold at a fixed price without regard to any published tariff or index 
the currently limited volumes and sources of our gas production mean we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain by limiting our market for potential customers 
pogc is the primary purchaser of domestic gas in poland 
we expect that the prices we receive in the short term for gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a more competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do in the future 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the immediate future  our policy is to use zloty based revenues generated in poland to pay for all zloty based invoices  supplemented as needed by transferring us dollars to poland to cover invoices that exceed the generated revenues
