table of contents the company manufactures components and assemblies principally for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter and space programs 
the company s miltec subsidiary provides engineering  technical and program management services almost entirely for united states defense  space and homeland security programs 
the company s mix of military  commercial and space business in  and  respectively  was approximately as follows military commercial space total the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and the apache helicopter programs

the positive factors were partially offset by higher bonus accruals  higher environmental accruals and a higher effective tax rate in compared to critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue from products sold under long term contracts is recognized by the company on the same basis as other sale transactions 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of services including prototype products based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue 
table of contents is recognized i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price service contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  comparable company analyses  discount rates and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in the event that a goodwill impairment charge is required  it would adversely affect the operating results and financial position of the company 
other intangible assets the company amortizes purchased other intangible assets with finite lives using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to fourteen years 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation for stock options the company uses a black scholes valuation model in determining the compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the company has two identified award populations  one with an option vesting term of four years and the other with an option vesting term of one year 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
for performance and restricted stock units the company calculates compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service performance period of the awards 
the performance stock units vest based on a three year cumulative performance cycle 
the restricted stock units vest at the end of five years 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on it historic experience 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage incurred  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it if necessary to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand and not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required

das and other companies and government entities have entered into consent decrees with respect to each landfill with the united states environmental protection agency and or california environmental agencies under which certain investigation  remediation and maintenance activities are being performed 
based upon currently available information  the company has established a reserve for its estimated liability in connection with the landfills in the approximate amount of  the company s ultimate liability in connection with these matters will depend upon a number of factors  including changes in existing laws and regulations  the design and cost of construction  operation and maintenance activities  and the allocation of liability among potentially responsible parties

there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
the effective date of sfas no 
is delayed for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually

sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
this statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the requirements to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan was effective for the company for the calendar year ended december  the company adopted this requirement in and the incremental impact of sfas no 
was zero on the pension obligation
