our marketing and lead generation activities are designed to support the above sales strategy  to drive awareness and create and foster sales leads for the previously mentioned solutions  products and services  as well as increase visibility of the borland brand and our open alm strategy 
research and development we believe innovation  timeliness of product releases and high product quality are essential to maintain a competitive position 
consequently  we dedicate considerable resources to development efforts to enhance existing 
table of contents products and developing new products 
the product development group is responsible for the design  development and release of product enhancements  upgrades and new products 
our research and development efforts are directed at enhancing our current technology and products  especially alm products 
we devote a significant percentage of our operating expenses to research and development efforts 
research and development expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of total revenue in those years 
rapid technological advances in software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete 
we believe a significant level of research and development is required to achieve our strategic goals and to remain competitive 
even while we aim to manage costs in other areas of our business  we expect to continue to invest in  and commit substantial resources to  product development and engineering 
in addition  our product development depends  in part  on licenses with third parties for technology that is incorporated into our products and we intend to continue this practice in the future to the extent we believe it is necessary or efficient for product development strategy 
competition our markets are intensely competitive 
in the market for comprehensive software development solutions  we face competition from some of the largest software providers in the world  including ibm  microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  inc  hewlett packard company  computer associates and others 
we also compete with smaller software companies including serena software  inc  compuware corporation and telelogic ab 
these companies currently provide or have stated they intend to provide more comprehensive enterprise software development and integration solutions 
we attempt to differentiate our products and solutions from those of our competitors based on cross platform interoperability  breadth of our alm offering  integration with process improvement and skills educational services  total cost of ownership  product quality  performance  and reliability 
in the market for our individual ide products  we face competition from the same companies above  as well as open source initiatives  and several smaller companies 
we compete in these markets on cross platform interoperability  ability to integrate with other products  price  product quality  product functionality  brand  distribution and reputation 
manufacturing our product development groups produce a set of master cd roms or diskettes and documentation for our products  which are then released to manufacturing 
all manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by outside contractors under the supervision of borland s logistics organization 
this process includes replication of cd roms or diskettes  printing and production of documentation and packaging materials and assembly of final product packages for shipment to customers 
our products are sold in cd rom or diskette format with attached user documentation or delivered directly to customers via electronic download 
borland believes adequate supplies and sources exist for the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products 
intellectual property our success depends upon our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have over patents issued in the united states  which expire between and employees as of december   we employed  employees  of which were engaged in selling  general and administrative functions and were engaged in research and development

risk factors risks relating to our business we have limited experience in the enterprise market for application lifecycle management  or alm  software solutions 
if we are unable to successfully achieve our strategic goals  our operating results could be harmed 
since we are still in the early stages of focusing our business on open alm  and considering alm is a relatively new and evolving market  it is difficult for us to predict our likelihood of success 
there is a limited history upon which to base assumptions as to our probability of success and we are in the process of developing and implementing new products  solutions and sales and marketing strategies 
the change in the primary focus of our business from ide to open alm has involved significant changes in our go to market strategy  our sales and services organizations and sales cycles and our marketing strategies 
if we are not able to successfully develop and implement our new strategies  our business and operating results will be harmed 
our success is dependent upon our ability to develop effective products which meet our customers complex and evolving needs and to integrate our products into effective alm solutions 
we produce and sell a broad portfolio of products to manage the software development process 
the market for these products is characterized by continuous technological advancement  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our customers use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software and operating platforms 
while we plan to continue to invest resources to develop products for new or emerging software and hardware platforms in the server  desktop  mobile and other environments that may develop  there is a risk that a new hardware or software platform for which we do not provide products could rapidly grow in popularity 
in particular  we believe that this risk is substantial for particular proprietary platforms and languages for which we may not be given economically feasible access or access at all 
as a result  we may not be in a position to develop products for such platforms or may be late in doing so 
if we fail to introduce new products that address the needs of emerging market segments or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance as a result of delays in development or other factors  our future growth and revenue opportunity could suffer 
a significant portion of our research and development focus is on integrating our existing and recently acquired products into cohesive alm solutions 
managing our development activities as we gain experience in the evolving alm market is complex and involves a number of risks 
we may not be successful in designing and marketing new products  integrating products into cohesive solutions or providing the necessary enhancements or features to address the sophisticated and varied needs of our customers 
to be successful in this market  we will also need to be able to compete with several large and well established companies with more experience and resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 
our markets are intensely competitive 
in the market for comprehensive software development solutions  we face competition from some of the largest software providers in the world 
for example  ibm  microsoft  sun microsystems  hewlett packard  computer associates and others provide or have stated they intend to provide comprehensive enterprise software development and integration solutions 
traditionally  we have partnered with some of these competitors to offer a broader solution to their or our customer base  however  as our partners and business strategy change  a larger market overlap may develop and some or all of these partnering arrangements could be adversely affected or terminated 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers  extensive knowledge of the market  substantial experience in selling enterprise solutions  strong professional services and technical support offerings and extensive product development  sales and marketing resources 
as a result of their greater resources and established relationships  these competitors may be more successful than we are at developing and marketing products and solutions in our markets 

table of contents in addition  the markets for our codegear products are characterized by rapid change  new and emerging technologies  and aggressive competition 
some of our competitors include ibm  microsoft and sun microsystems 
we attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors based on interoperability  total cost of ownership  product quality  performance  level of integration and reliability 
we may be unable to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors  or we may be unable to compete with the substantially greater resources many of our competitors have 
if so  our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
our inability to forecast our revenue pipeline or convert revenue pipeline into contracts  especially given our focus on enterprise customers  could increase fluctuations in our revenue and financial results 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our alm business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all potential transactions  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of each transaction 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period 
when customers delay purchasing decisions  reduce the amount of their purchases or cancel their purchases altogether  it will reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts and our revenues will be harmed 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner 
our inability to respond to a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  or at all  could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our business involves licenses of our software that are made directly to large enterprises 
these large transactions involve multiple elements and tend to be lengthy and unpredictable 
sales to enterprise customers generally require substantial time  effort and money as we aim to establish relationships and educate them about our solutions 
also  sales to enterprise customers generally require an extensive sales effort throughout many levels within the customer s organization and often require final approval by several layers of the customer s executives 
these factors substantially extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will be made in any particular quarter  or at all 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays and uncertainties in our sales cycles as well as increased up front expenses in connection with our enterprise sales efforts 
the timing of the execution of enterprise volume licenses could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  especially when we anticipate certain transactions will close in a particular quarter 
further  industry buying patterns suggest that larger transactions are frequently deferred until later in the quarter  creating increased difficulty in quarterly forecasting 
if a sale is never completed despite months or even years of selling efforts  we will have expended substantial time  money and resources during the pre sales effort without generating any revenue to offset these expenses 
finally  due to the complexity and time commitment necessary to pursue each of these transactions  we focus on a small number of proposed sales at any time and if we fail to complete any of these sales  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected 
the complexity of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could limit our ability to predict our revenue and materially affect our financial results for a given period 
although we use standardized agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in multi product license and services transactions 
as our transactions have increased in complexity  particularly with the sale of larger  multi product licenses  negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may require us to defer recognition of revenue on such licenses 
we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  however  more complex  multi product license transactions require additional accounting analysis to account for them accurately 
errors in such analysis in any period could lead to unanticipated changes in our revenue accounting practices and 
table of contents may affect the timing of revenue recognition  which could adversely affect our financial results for any given period 
if we discover that we have interpreted and applied revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the u 
s  we could be required to devote significant management resources  and incur the expense associated with an audit  restatement or other examination of our financial statements 
our failure to implement systems to meet the requirements and manage the large service projects necessary for our enterprise may result in delays in recognizing revenue on these projects and thus could harm our profit and adversely affect our results of operations 
our enterprise business focuses on large  complex professional services agreements 
our inability to structure and manage services agreements may result in unanticipated changes to the timing of our services revenue 
in addition  if we bundle services together with our license agreements  this may also affect the timing of recognizing our license revenue 
we may need to implement new systems or upgrade current systems to manage these large  complex services agreements 
if we fail to make appropriate changes to our existing systems or if our services agreements lead to unanticipated changes to the timing of revenue recognition  our results of operations could be harmed 
we have recently undergone significant changes to our financial reporting and accounting team and systems and are still in the process of making changes to these systems in international regions  which may impact our ability to comply with our financial reporting and accounting obligations 
in october  we moved our corporate headquarters from cupertino  ca to austin  tx and in connection with this move  we transitioned a significant portion of our finance team 
while we planned for an orderly transition  our new hires have a limited history working together as a part of our accounting team 
we also recently began to build an internal audit team  in conjunction with reducing our reliance upon consultants to assess our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  we recently changed our financial reporting systems in the united states and are continuing to implement changes in our international regions 
while we have taken measures aimed at protecting data and keeping accurate records  there can be no assurance the transition will be done without causing errors  delays or inefficiencies 
if we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately or maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
we are in the process of implementing plans for reducing expenses and if we fail to achieve the results we expect  there will be a negative effect on our financial condition 
we announced restructuring plans during  which included the consolidation of certain office locations  reductions in capital expenditures  reduction in discretionary spending  reduction in the work force and other cost cutting measures 
we may not be able to realize the cost savings we anticipate from these measures 
for example  we may not be able to exit facilities with long term leases 
if we are not able to implement these measures as planned  further cost reduction efforts may be necessary 
our plans to reduce expenses may not be completed in a timely manner  which would impair our goal to achieve profitability and positive cash flow 
in addition  although we are aiming to implement plans to reach sustainable profitability in the second half of  we are currently operating at a net loss and there can be no assurance as to when we will return to profitability  if at all 
in order to fund our ongoing operations in future periods it will be necessary for us to achieve profitability 
we and our independent registered public accounting firm  previously determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
there can be no assurance that a material weakness will not arise in the future 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in our annual reports on form k for the years ended december  and  respectively  we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have since remediated these deficiencies and continue to spend a significant amount of time 
table of contents and resources to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of as reported in section a of this form k  our management does not believe we had any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  however  considering that we have and will continue to evolve our business in a changing marketplace  we are continuing to implement changes in our erp systems and will continue to make corresponding changes in our internal control in financial reporting  there can be no assurance that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future 
should we or our independent registered public accounting firm  determine in future fiscal periods that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
in prior periods  we were unable to timely file our annual and quarterly reports as required by the securities exchange act of  and our continued inability to file these reports on time could result in your not having access to important information about us and the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq stock market 
we were late in filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and our quarterly reports on forms q for the fiscal quarters ended march   june   and september  as a result  during the periods in which these reports were late  we were not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market and  in some cases  with the sec s rules and regulations under the securities exchange act of we are required to comply with these rules as a condition of the continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq stock market 
although we are not currently late with respect to any annual or quarterly report  there can be no assurance that we will be able to file all such reports in the future in a timely manner 
if we are unable to timely file these reports in the future  it may impede your access to important information about us 
this could cause us to incur substantial expenses  including an increase in the interest rate under our convertible senior notes offering  issued in february further  in the case of a prolonged delay in filing  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
delisting could result in our common stock no longer being traded on any securities exchange or over the counter market and could impact its liquidity and price 
in addition  if we were delisted  we would be in default under the senior convertible notes  which would cause the notes to become immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to maintain revenue levels for our deployment  or application middleware  products  our financial results may be harmed 
we currently have a portion of our revenue attributable to our deployment products  which we also call or application middleware products 
these products are mature products and we primarily rely on new sales to existing customers  maintenance agreements with existing customers  compliance purchases through customer audits and sales through existing independent software vendors and original equipment manufacturers partners to generate revenue 
we have experienced weakness and fluctuations in revenue from these products in the past and believe they will continue to be subject to commoditization 
our deployment products are generally based on older standards and technologies  which are used in a decreasing number of industries  networks and applications 
we devote little marketing resources to these products and primarily rely on the effectiveness of the sales force and compliance teams to work with customers and partners to generate sales 
there have been many changes in the sales force over the past several quarters  especially in europe where we have historically generated a significant amount of revenue from our deployment products 
if we are unable to maintain effective sales programs for our deployment products  or if existing customers migrate away from our deployment products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
because competition for qualified technical and management personnel is intense  we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel  which could harm our business 
we believe our ability to successfully manage and grow our business and to develop new products depends  in large part  on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled software engineers  
table of contents sales personnel and management personnel 
competition for qualified technical and management personnel is intense and in the past some of our competitors have utilized their greater resources to provide substantial signing bonuses and other inducements to lure key personnel away from us 
we have implemented various cost cutting efforts  which makes it challenging to retain key people and recruit new talent  as needed 
consolidation in our industry or fluctuation in our stock price may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation continues to occur among companies that compete in our markets 
additionally  some of the largest software and hardware providers in the world have sought to expand their software and services offerings through acquisitions in the software development  deployment and integration space 
if large providers  who have significantly greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have  are successful in increasing their offerings in the software development market  our business will be subject to significant pressure and our ability to compete effectively harmed 
additionally  changes resulting from these and other consolidations may harm our competitive position  particularly as certain products  when offered as part of a bundled suite  are offered for free or are given away to sell more hardware  infrastructure components or information technology services 
as the trend toward consolidation continues  we may encounter increased competition for attractive acquisition targets and may have to pay higher prices for those businesses or technologies we seek to acquire 
in addition  we have seen a recent decline in our stock price  which will in turn make it more difficult for us to use stock as a currency for the acquisition of strategic businesses or technologies 
this will put pressure on our ability to seek out potential acquisition targets which may impede our growth and our ability to compete effectively 
we depend on technologies licensed to us by third parties  such as sun microsystems and microsoft  and the loss of or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales or shipments of certain of our products 
we depend on licenses from third party suppliers for some elements of our products such as various file libraries 
in particular  we depend on technology licenses from sun microsystems for certain of our java products  and we depend on licenses from microsoft for our delphi  c  c builder and borland developer studio products 
if any of these licenses or other third party licenses were terminated or were not renewed  or if these third parties failed to notify us in a timely manner of any new or updated technology  we might not be able to ship such products as planned or provide support for such products  including upgrades 
we would then have to seek an alternative to the third party s technology and  in some cases  an alternative may not exist 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs by having to secure unfavorable royalty arrangements or reduced functionality of our products  which in turn could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to manage our international operations could harm our results 
a substantial portion of our revenues are generated from international sales 
in addition  a significant portion of our operations consist of activities outside the united states 
we now have research and development facilities in several domestic and international locations  and we currently have a direct sales force in approximately eighteen countries around the world 
we have a complicated corporate structure  and historically have had geographically dispersed operational controls 
in particular  we rely on personnel in our international locations to properly account for and manage our international operations  which introduce inherent difficulties in management and control 
given this  we have and may continue to experience difficulty in efficiently and effectively managing our dispersed and complicated organization 
as a result  our results of operations may suffer 
in addition  we are subject to other risks inherent in doing business internationally  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty of staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries and continents  
table of contents potentially reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights than is available under the laws of the united states  longer payment cycles in some countries and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  restrictions on the expatriation of currency  foreign taxes  export restrictions  tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  changes in regulatory requirements and resulting costs  differing cultures and business practices not consistent with our regulatory obligations in the united states  compliance with various conflicting laws and regulations  including employment laws  and resulting costs  and war  threats of war  terrorist activity or political or economic instability in certain parts of the world 
one or more of these risks could harm our future research operations and international sales 
if we are unable to manage these risks of doing business internationally  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
bundling arrangements or product give aways by our competitors  including available  cost free development technologies  may diminish demand for our products or pressure us to reduce our prices 
some of our competitors  particularly those that are primarily hardware vendors or platform providers  generate a substantially greater proportion of their sales in markets in which we do not directly compete 
we believe a number of these competitors view sales of software application lifecycle technologies as important to enhancing the functionality and demand for their core products 
as a result  these companies often bundle software products that compete with our offerings  with products such as application servers  work stations  personal computers  operating systems databases and information technology services 
when competitors do so  the effective price for their software products that compete with our software development platform solutions are often heavily discounted or offered at no charge 
this has required us to reduce the price of our products and related services in certain circumstances  sometimes to no avail 
similarly  industry alliances and arrangements exist or may be formed in the future under which our competitors ally with companies in markets in which we do not compete to bundle products 
these arrangements may also result in lower effective prices for our competitors products than for our products  putting pressure on our business and diminishing our competitive position 
our future success depends upon enhancing existing relationships and establishing new technology alliances 
the market for enterprise software application development and deployment solutions is broad  and our products and solutions must integrate with a wide variety of technologies 
to be successful  we must continue to establish and enhance strategic alliances with a wide variety of companies in the software development ecosystem 
many of these companies have competitive products or have stated a desire to move broadly into the software development lifecycle space 
in addition  many of these companies are competitive with one another and approach partnering with us cautiously 
this has made it difficult in some cases to establish or enhance desired relationships or achieve intended objectives 
we currently have a number of important strategic alliances and technology relationships with industry leaders 
where we have established working relationships  our allies may choose to terminate their arrangements with us where no binding contractual arrangements exist 
the failure to develop or maintain our strategic alliances and technology relationships or our allies decision to opt out of their arrangements with us may impede our ability to introduce new products or enter new markets  and consequently harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our products may contain unknown defects that could result in a loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
software products occasionally contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
we cannot be certain that our products are currently or will be completely free of defects and errors 
we could lose revenue as a result of product defects or errors  including defects contained in third party products that enable our products to work 
in addition  the discovery of a defect or error in a new version or product may result in the following consequences  among others delayed shipping of the product  delay in or failure to ever achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  product liability claims  and increased service and warranty costs 
we believe our alm products are critical to our customers and a defect or error in our products could result in a significant disruption to their businesses 
due to the nature of our complex solutions  there is also the risk that our current products will not prove scalable without substantial effort 
if we are unable to develop products that are free of defects or errors or if our products are not able to scale across an enterprise or are perceived to be too complex to scale across an enterprise  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly litigation or settlement terms or limit the sales of our products 
from time to time  we receive notices claiming that we have infringed a third party s patent or other intellectual property right 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality becomes more widespread 
further  the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require in some situations a costly opinion of counsel be obtained to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
regardless of its merits  responding to any claim can be time consuming and costly and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  discontinue the use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that might not be offered or be available on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim was made against us and we failed to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims or our insurance coverage for these types of claims may not be adequate 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets 
as a software company  our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights  but these measures may provide only limited protection 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriations of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse engineer or decompile our software products 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights  particularly in certain international markets  making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights  and such litigation can be time consuming and expensive 

table of contents our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in february  we issued an aggregate principal amount of  in convertible senior notes due in the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could require us to dedicate a portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of our cash available for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and research and development expenditures  make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  limit our ability to sell ourselves or engage in other strategic transactions  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this section entitled risk factors  or otherwise  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
although the convertible senior notes mature in  the holders of the convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase their notes prior to maturity under certain circumstances  including specified fundamental changes such as the sale of a majority of the voting power of the company 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of the convertible senior notes  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at such time 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
conversion of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
the terms of the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the notes into shares of our common stock 
the convertible senior notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of per share  which would result in an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events  provided that the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion  as may be adjusted for fundamental changes or otherwise  may not exceed approximately million shares 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
each  of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
however we may seek to obtain stockholder approval to settle conversions of the notes in cash and shares of common stock  which approval would require the vote of a majority of shares of our common stock at a stockholder meeting duly called and convened in accordance with our organizational documents  applicable law and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  holders may convert their convertible senior notes prior to maturity if the price of our common stock reaches during specific periods of time  specified corporate transactions occur or the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 
as a result  although the convertible senior notes mature in  the holders may require us to convert the notes prior to maturity 
as of the date this annual report on form k was filed with the securities and exchange commission  none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had occurred 

table of contents under the terms of the convertible senior notes due  events that we do not control may trigger conversion rights that  if exercised  may have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
holders of our convertible senior notes due will have the right to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of borland  including some types of change of control transactions 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes in cash or to make the required repayment at such time or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes  if we have received approval from our stockholders to settle conversions of the notes in cash and shares of our common stock  we will be required to make cash payments to the holders of the notes equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted and the conversion value of those notes 
such payments could be significant  and we may not have sufficient funds to make them at such time 
our failure to repurchase the notes or pay cash in respect of conversions when required would result in an event of default 
our rights plan and our ability to issue additional preferred stock could harm the rights of our common stockholders 
in october  we adopted our stockholder rights plan and currently each share of our outstanding common stock is associated with one right 
each right entitles the registered stockholder to purchase  of a share of our series d junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of 
the rights only become exercisable in certain limited circumstances following the tenth day after a person or group announces acquisition of or tender offers for or more of our common stock 
for a limited period of time following the announcement of any such acquisition or offer  the rights are redeemable by us at a price of per right 
if the rights are not redeemed  each right will then entitle the holder to purchase common stock having the value of twice the then current exercise price 
for a limited period of time after the exercisability of the rights  each right  at the discretion of our board of directors  may be exchanged for either  share of series d junior participating preferred stock or one share of common stock 
the rights expire on december  pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without the consent of our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of series d junior participating preferred stock or any preferred stock subsequently issued by our board of directors  under some circumstances  could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
for example  an issuance of shares of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the stockholders of our common stock  make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  limit or eliminate any payments the stockholders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
specifically  some provisions may deter tender offers for shares of common stock  which may be attractive to stockholders  or deter purchases of large blocks of common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock over the then prevailing market prices 

table of contents provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and  therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous 
these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board that could increase the number of outstanding shares and discourage a takeover attempt  limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  provide that our board is expressly authorized to amend our bylaws  or enact such other bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  certain of our named executive officers and certain other executives have entered into change of control severance agreements  which were approved by our compensation committee 
these agreements would likely increase the costs that an acquirer would face in purchasing us and may thereby act to discourage such a purchase

we presently have excess facilities under lease  and we are actively negotiating the sublease for some of these lease commitments as part of our restructuring plans we put in place in and  which are discussed under part ii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  consisting of intellectual property  commercial  employment and other matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies we record a liability when we believe it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  however  we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us  as well as adequate accruals for any probable and estimable losses 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations for that period 
we believe that  except as described above  given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances  even were we to receive an adverse judgment with respect to litigation that we are currently a party to  it is likely that such a judgment would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights  disputing royalties  or disputing other commercial arrangements 
regardless of the merit of any such claim  responding to these claims could be time consuming and expensive  and may require us to enter into licensing or royalty agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we expect that our software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment increases  the functionality of products overlap and industry participants become more aggressive in using patents offensively

overview borland is a leading vendor of open application lifecycle management solutions  or alm  which represents the segment of the alm market in which vendors solutions are flexible enough to support a customer s specific processes  tools and platforms 
open alm is a new  customer centric approach to helping it organizations transform software delivery into a managed  efficient and predictable business process 
we offer a combination of software products as well as consulting and education services to help our customers better manage the growing complexity of software development 
our goal is to provide customers with a foundation which will allow them to consistently deliver software on time  on budget and with increased business value 
borland s solutions address five critical alm processes project portfolio management  requirements definition management  lifecycle quality management  model driven development and software change management 
each solution can play an important role in helping enterprises manage the complexity of software development and delivery  by providing business  development and operational teams with increased visibility and control over all phases of the software lifecycle 
we believe this is especially crucial for large enterprises working within heterogeneous and distributed environments 
we have been evolving our business and strategy in recent years in response to the many changes occurring in the software industry and specifically in our market 
in a march study  idc forecasted the alm market to grow to billion in  achieving a compound annual growth rate between and in order to capitalize on the alm market growth  over the past several quarters we have made changes to our overall product portfolio  our worldwide services organization  our r d investments  as well as our global sales and marketing models to reflect our open alm vision and product strategy 
as part of this transformation  we have shifted our focus from selling individual stand alone products to selling more multi product  enterprise class solutions 
effective january   consistent with how we manage our business  we changed from reporting one segment to reporting two segments enterprise and codegear 
a summary of the types of products and services provided by the enterprise and codegear segments is provided below 
enterprise 
our enterprise segment focuses on open application lifecycle management solutions  or alm  which includes a combination of software products as well as consulting and education services to help our customers better manage their software development projects 
our alm portfolio includes products and services for project and portfolio management  requirements definition and management  lifecycle quality management  software configuration and change management and modeling

codegear also provides worldwide developer support and education services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
changes in these accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by us 
to the extent there are material differences 
table of contents between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in addition to these estimates and assumptions which are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements  we make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue 
specifically  our sales personnel monitor the status of proposals  including the estimated closing dates and potential dollar amounts 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time  which is subject to change 
the inability to properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenue could significantly affect our future operations 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
to be specific  an enterprise software financial model includes expenses which are substantially fixed in the near term and revenue which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
revenue is typically recorded in the latter part of a given quarter  therefore  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner  and such delays may adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of those critical accounting polices and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures related to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include  post contract customer support  or pcs  consulting and education 
we recognize license fees on contracts  which do not involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products upon delivery when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we determine the value for services based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  and related accounting literature 
vsoe for the consulting services element is based upon the standard rates we charge for services  given the complexity of the services and experience of the professional performing the services  or the amount charged on similar transactions 
vsoe for annual pcs is based on the stated future renewal rates  if substantive  included in the contracts  the amount charged on a similar transaction or other specific evidence 
we recognize revenue for the license portion of a multiple element arrangement based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine the collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
if we determine that a fee is not fixed or determinable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue as the fee becomes due 
we generally recognize revenue for software licensed for a specific time period  or license term  ratably over the term of the license 
historically  we developed solutions providing specific functionality to certain hardware vendors 
these solutions may involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products 
we recognize license and service revenues associated with contracts involving significant implementation  integration or new functionality  either on a percentage of completion basis or a completed contract basis depending on 
table of contents whether or not we can obtain reliable estimates of the costs to complete the work 
percentage of completion accounting often involves complex accounting decisions  judgments and estimates regarding future costs and recoverability of unbilled amounts 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and or service revenues  based upon the estimated fair value of each element based upon vsoe 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
during  and we did not account for any consulting contracts on a completed contract basis or a percentage of completion basis 
service revenues from consulting and education services related to the implementation of our software are recognized when services are performed 
service revenues from our process consulting are recognized based on when services are performed or when certain milestones have been met  depending on our arrangement with the customer 
for process consulting services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab service revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the support period  which is generally one year 
net revenue on our products held by our distributors is recognized upon sell through to their customers and we maintain allowances for returns for all unsold products held by our distributors 
additionally  we maintain allowances for product returns from our channel resellers and end users  whose revenues are recognized on a sell in basis  based upon historical return rates  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
management makes significant judgments and estimates when establishing our sales returns and other allowances  especially when concerning channel resellers 
the provision for sales returns and rebates is recorded as a reduction to license and other revenues in the period that the accrual is considered necessary 
the reserve balance is recorded on the balance sheet as an accounts receivable allowance 
if future returns and rebates increase over historical levels  additional allowances may be required 
as we continue to focus our business on the alm market and enterprise solution selling  we will continue to become more dependent on large  multi product transactions to meet our revenue expectations 
these transactions typically involve longer sales cycles and the timing of these deals could cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows 
accounting for acquisitions in april  we completed the acquisition of segue software  inc  or segue 
segue was a massachusetts based provider of quality and testing solutions that defined  measured  managed and improved software quality throughout the entire application lifecycle 
the purchase price was approximately million and consisted of fixed consideration of million in cash used to purchase all of segue s outstanding common shares  million in cash paid to eligible segue employees who held vested common stock options on the closing date of the acquisition and million of direct acquisition related costs 
cash acquired in the acquisition was million 
the results of operations for segue have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in october  we completed the acquisition of privately held legadero  a texas based provider of information technology management and governance solutions for software development and delivery 
the purchase price consisted of fixed consideration of million in cash plus contingent consideration of million for retention payments to be earned through the continued employment of certain key employees 
this contingent consideration vests and will be paid over a two year period or earlier under certain circumstances and will be recognized as compensation expense in the period earned 
in addition  we incurred million of acquisition related costs subsequent to the completion of the acquisition 
options to purchase  shares of common stock pursuant to our supplemental stock option plan were issued to legadero employees who became borland employees 
these options vest over a four year period 
cash acquired in the acquisition was million 
the results of operations for legadero have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

table of contents in january  we completed the acquisition of privately held teraquest  a texas based consulting firm focusing on software improvement  quality assurance and risk management for corporate and government software organizations 
the purchase price consisted of fixed consideration of million in cash and million of acquisition related costs 
the contingent consideration includes cash retention payments of million to be earned through the continued employment of certain key employees 
this contingent consideration vested over a two year period 
in addition  million of restricted stock  which will vest over a four year period  was issued to certain teraquest key employees upon the closing 
cash acquired in the acquisition was million 
results of operations for teraquest have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we account for acquisitions as purchases in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  we report all acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities of acquired companies at fair value 
our determination of the values of acquired intangibles was based on the discounted cash flow method 
we recognize the fair value of purchased identifiable intangibles as an operating expense over the estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible  unless the identifiable intangible is determined to have an indefinite life 
we recognize the fair value associated with in process technology as an operating expense during the period the transaction is consummated 
we value employee stock options assumed as part of acquisitions using the black scholes valuation model 
the value of all vested awards and the value of unvested awards in excess of the intrinsic value of the unvested awards are included as part of the purchase consideration 
we report the intrinsic value of the unvested awards as compensation and record it as an operating expense over the remaining vesting period of the award 
we value our stock issued as part of the purchase consideration based upon the average of the closing price for the five day trading period surrounding the transaction 
we report total consideration in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets  net of assumed liabilities  as goodwill 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations  or sfas and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible asset  or sfas effective january   we changed from reporting one segment to reporting two segments enterprise and codegear 
as of january   we began utilizing a combination of a discounted cash flow and market approach and goodwill was allocated to each of the reporting segments 
please refer to note reportable segments below for more information on the accounting related to the reportable segments 
under sfas  goodwill and other long lived assets must be tested for impairment annually or in interim periods  if conditions indicate possible impairment 
impairment testing of goodwill is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed our annual testing of goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of and no impairment was indicated as of september  at december   we took into consideration various data points when determining the implied fair value including discounted cash flows and market comparable transactions 
our estimated fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reporting value of goodwill and may result in future write downs beyond the current reduction 
as a result of this testing  impairment of million was recorded against our codegear reporting segment 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter of based on a single reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment as of september  the market capitalization method was the primary method used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes 
we considered the establishment of two segments as a triggering event under fas and performed a goodwill allocation and impairment analysis at december  for our reporting segments enterprise and codegear 
we used the cash flow method in determining fair values for goodwill allocation and impairment purposes and concluded there was no impairment for the goodwill allocated to each segment 
we did not record impairment to goodwill during refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

table of contents we may incur substantial liabilities in connection with our acquisitions that are accounted for as purchases 
these include the termination of employees  asserted claims or litigation  impairment of assets or termination of leases 
we estimate merger related costs at the time of the acquisition and accrue these costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  with an offsetting entry to goodwill 
these accruals involve estimates regarding future events  sometimes several years in the future 
we may make revisions and adjustments to the accrual and the related goodwill based on actual events 
restructuring we report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
 sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  as applicable 
under sfas no 
 we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
the definition of significant future services does not include any retention period up to days in connection with the employee earning the termination benefits 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future payments with no future economic benefit or a commitment to pay the termination costs of a prior commitment 
in future periods we will record accretion expense to increase our liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the leases 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to find a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
should actual lease exit costs differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring charge which would impact net income in the period such adjustment was recorded 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after january  and granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and  accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility  and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in 
table of contents addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we evaluate the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair market value is determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
no impairment was recorded in  and investment securities we report investments in debt and marketable equity securities  and equity securities in our investment portfolio  at fair value based on quoted market prices or  if quoted prices are not available  discounted expected cash flows using market rates commensurate with the credit quality and maturity of the investment 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities are included in equity  net of applicable taxes and other adjustments 
we regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of that market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or until forecasted recovery  and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer 
unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
unrealized gains and losses on investment securities classified as trading and certain retained interests are included in earnings

income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between 
table of contents financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the weight of the available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
if our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change  we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we make the determination 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we record liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
we also record deferred tax liabilities for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested 
contingencies our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims which management has determined have a reasonable probability of resulting in payment by us and for which management can estimate the loss amount or range of amounts 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the outcome and loss amount or range of loss of pending litigation and demands  management is unable to make a determinative estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and demands  and revise our estimates  record new estimates or remove previously recorded estimates accordingly 
such updates to our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have numerous foreign subsidiaries  which together accounted for of our total revenues in and of our total assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in unrealized exchange gains and losses  which are included as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is considered the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
cumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the local currency 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations in the period during which the disposal occurs 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a 
table of contents subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of million and million  which were included as part of cumulative other comprehensive income within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded net unrealized foreign currency gains totaling million as part of other comprehensive income on the balance sheet  which included translation gains and losses associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
during  we recorded net unrealized foreign currency gains totaling million 
during  we recorded net unrealized foreign currency losses totaling million 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our results of operations for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
these currencies have included the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  chinese yuan  korean won  brazilian real  russian ruble  indian rupee and australian  new zealand  canadian  singapore and hong kong dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations

please refer to note reportable segments below for more information on the accounting related to the reportable segments 
under sfas  goodwill and other long lived assets must be tested for impairment annually or in interim periods  if conditions indicate possible impairment 
impairment testing of goodwill is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed our annual testing of goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of and no impairment was indicated as of september  at december   we took into consideration various data points when determining the implied fair value including discounted cash flows and market comparable transactions 
our estimated fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reporting value of goodwill and may result in future write downs beyond the current reduction 
as a result of this testing  impairment of million was recorded against our codegear reporting segment 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter of based on a single reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment as of september  the market capitalization method was the primary method used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes 
we considered the establishment of two segments as a triggering event under fas and performed a goodwill allocation and impairment analysis at december  for our reporting segments enterprise and codegear 
we used the cash flow method in determining fair values for goodwill allocation and impairment purposes and concluded there was no impairment for the goodwill allocated to each segment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our results from operations are primarily a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address the foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts as described below 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents foreign currency risk a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the local currency of the country in which we have established business operations 
both revenues and operating expenses in each of these countries are in local currencies 
this mitigates a portion of the exposure related to fluctuations in local currencies against the us dollar 
however  our financial results could still be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  we have established a program to minimize our foreign currency exposure utilizing forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to non functional currency balances 
during  we recorded net realized foreign exchange losses of million  included as part of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the foreign exchange losses were primarily due to fluctuation in the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  the singapore dollar and the japanese yen versus the us dollar 
it is uncertain whether these currency trends will continue 
in the future we may experience foreign exchange losses on our non functional currency denominated receivables and payables to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
during we recorded unrealized foreign currency gain of million  in cumulative other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets  in part  due to foreign currency movements on our long term inter company balances 
as of december   we had million  million  million  million and million in long term inter company receivable balances that will be settled in singapore dollars  indian rupee  brazilian real  australian dollars  and japanese yen  respectively and million in long term inter company payable balances that will be settled in euros 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during  we initiated an investment strategy to achieve this objective by investing available funds in a portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including but not limited to government and corporate securities  auction rate securities  time deposits and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
we have limited exposure to risks related to auction rate securities as we have sold the remaining million in auction rate securities in january  with an immaterial gain 
a hypothetical decrease on basis points in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would reduce annual pre tax earning by approximately million 
actual results may differ from this estimate 
short term investments 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of commercial paper 
short term investments consist of marketable securities  including but not limited to corporate notes  corporate bonds and medium term notes in large us institutions and governmental agencies and auction rate securities 
our marketable securities that are classified as short term investments will mature in less than one year from december  auction rate securities may have nominal maturity dates that are more than one year from december   but are classified as short term investments by the company 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value 
long term investments 
at december   long term investments consisted of long term marketable securities 
we will periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that could be considered other than temporary 
we classify our long term investments as available for sale 

table of contents credit risks our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions and commercial paper 
we have limited exposure to risk related to auction rate securities as we have sold the remaining million in auction rate securities in january  with an immaterial gain 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
no single customer represented greater than of total accounts receivable  net of allowances  as of december   or
