overview through our us subsidiaries  we provide primary and modified pool mortgage guaranty insurance coverage to residential mortgage lenders and investors as a credit enhancement vehicle 
we classify insurance as primary when we are in the first loss position and the ltv is or greater when the loan is first insured 
we classify all other insurance as modified pool 
the majority of our primary insurance is delivered through the flow channel  which is defined as loans originated by lenders and submitted to us on a loan by loan basis 
we have also historically provided mortgage insurance to lenders and investors who seek additional default protection typically secondary coverage or on loans for which the individual borrower has greater than equity  capital relief  and credit enhancement on groups of loans that are sold in the secondary market 
these transactions are referred to as our structured bulk channel business 
those individual loans in the structured bulk channel in which we are in the first loss position and the ltv ratio is greater than are classified as primary 
all of our modified pool insurance is delivered through the structured bulk channel 
we do not expect any significant production of modified pool or primary bulk business from the structured bulk channel in our canadian subsidiary was formed in for the express purpose of exploring the opportunities of providing mortgage insurance in canada  but did not write any business and only had start up expenses in we suspended our canadian expansion efforts in the fourth quarter of and we do not expect to write any business through our canadian subsidiary 
our revenues principally consist of a initial and renewal earned premiums from flow business net of reinsurance premiums ceded as part of our risk management strategies  b initial and renewal earned premiums from structured bulk transactions  and c investment income on invested assets 
we also realize investment gains  net of investment losses  periodically as a source of revenue when the opportunity presents itself within the context of our overall investment strategy 
our expenses essentially consist of a amounts paid on claims submitted  b changes in reserves for estimated future claim payments on loans that are currently in default  c general and administrative costs of acquiring new business and servicing existing policies  d other general business expenses  e interest expense on long term debt and line of credit  and f income taxes 
our profitability depends largely on a the volume of business insured combined with the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting discipline relative to the risks insured  b the conditions of the housing  mortgage and capital markets that have a direct impact on mitigation efforts  cure rates and ultimately the amount of claims paid  c the overall general state of the economy and job market  d persistency levels  e operating efficiencies  and f the level of investment yield  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio 

table of contents persistency is an important metric in understanding our premium revenue 
the longer a policy remains on our books  or persists  the greater the amount of revenue that we will derive from the policy from renewal premiums 
we define persistency as the amount of insurance in force at the month end of a financial reporting period as a percentage of the amount of insurance in force at the beginning of the period 
cancellations of policies originated during the past twelve months are not considered in our calculation of persistency 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
we believe that our calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining at the end of the month measurement period 
cancellations result primarily from the borrower refinancing or selling insured mortgaged residential properties and  to a lesser degree  from the borrower achieving prescribed equity levels  at which point the lender no longer requires mortgage guaranty insurance 
consolidated results of operations following is selected financial information for the last three years change change vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands  except per share data earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses other operating expenses net loss income diluted loss earnings per share a substantial increase in the reserve for losses and lae in was primarily responsible for our net loss for the increase in the reserves was directly related to the growth in the number of reported loans in default as well as an increase in the frequency and severity factors utilized in the reserve model 
additionally  the changing characteristics of the loans entering the default pool  with new defaults having substantially higher average risk per loan than a year ago  has contributed to the increase in reserves 
these factors have been especially evident in i distressed markets california  florida  arizona and nevada  ii the development of the and books of business  iii our primary bulk business written in  which is showing a significant amount of early payment defaults and has a significant amount of high ltv loans  and iv our recent modified pool business  which also has exhibited a significant amount of early payment defaults 
at december  distressed markets accounted for of the total risk in force but represented of both the risk in default and reserves 
at december   distressed markets accounted for of the total risk in force  but represented only of the risk in default and of reserves 
these distressed markets contributed million  or  of the total reserve increase experienced in  compared to million  or  of the total reserve increase experienced in net losses and lae for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  loss and lae reserves increased by million during the year  driven by a increase in the number of loans in default for which we provide a reserve and a increase in the average risk in default on those loans 
in addition to the substantial increase in reserves  there was also strong growth of paid losses in both total dollars and the average paid loss severity 
paid losses of million for were up million  or  as compared to average paid loss severity was  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase in average paid severity is primarily the result of a higher percentage of claims from the more recent vintage years  which reflect larger loan balances  and a decline in our ability to mitigate losses 
earned premiums for grew significantly when compared to  principally due to growth in primary insurance in force 
total insurance in force grew by billion  or  as a result of total niw of billion and a total annual persistency rate of 

table of contents other operating expenses for increased over due to organizational changes and staff additions to support our growth and strategic initiatives  including expenses associated with entering the canadian market 
we incurred approximately million of expenses in relating to our start up operations in canada 
the change in diluted loss earnings per share for from was consistent with the change in our operating results 
the denominator used in calculating diluted loss per share for shown above excludes exercise of options and unvested restricted stock  which is required when a loss from operations is being reported or the result would otherwise be antidilutive 
realized investment gains losses  net of taxes  decreased diluted loss per share in by  increased diluted earnings per share in by and had no impact on diluted earnings per share in diluted realized gains and losses per share is a non gaap measure 
we believe this is relevant and useful information to investors because  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  it shows the effect that our discretionary sales of investments had on results of operations 
we describe our results of operations in greater detail in the discussion that follows 
the information is presented in four categories production  insurance and risk in force  revenues  and losses and expenses 
production below is a summary of new production change change vs 
vs 
dollars in millions primary insurance written flow structured bulk total primary insurance written modified pool insurance written total insurance written total niw decreased slightly during  however  of total niw that was written in was written in the first two quarters  with and  respectively  coming in the third and fourth quarters of primary flow niw increased billion for compared to  however of the increase for was written in the first half of the year and  similar to total niw  declined in the third and fourth quarters of we believe it is likely that primary flow niw will continue to decline into for a variety of reasons including those described below american home mortgage corp 
ahm was our second largest customer for  contributing billion  or of our total primary flow niw 
ahm filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code during the third quarter of and  as a result  provided extremely limited production during the second half of we do not anticipate any further production from ahm 
the ahm bankruptcy  coupled with contractions in personnel and a reduction in production by two of our other large lender customers due to the unsettled nature of the mortgage marketplace  negatively impacted production for the second half of we expect that we will see further reductions in production in at december   our risk to capital ratio was to compared to to at december  the maximum risk to capital ratio permitted by most states is generally to in addition  we are subject to a maximum risk to capital ratio of to under our million credit facility 
our risk to capital ratio has been increasing over the last several quarters  partially as the result of operating losses during the third and fourth quarters of in order to manage our risk to capital ratio in this environment  we are carefully monitoring the writing of new business and allocating our capital against what we believe to be the most promising opportunities 
this allocation of capital is expected to further limit the amount of future production 
we discontinued a special lender paid program at the end of the second quarter that had been responsible for approximately million of niw per quarter for each of the first two quarters of and the last quarter of 
table of contents for the twelve months ended december   our exposure to loans with ltvs of greater than represented of primary niw 
as noted above  we are reducing the risk in our portfolio through tightened underwriting guidelines and are limiting our exposure to loans with ltvs of greater than 
our focus on quality through tightened underwriting guidelines has resulted  and we expect will continue to result  in the elimination of certain mortgage lenders with which we had historically done business and a reduction in volume from other lenders with which we continue to do business 
bulk insurance is a term that describes primary and modified pool mortgage insurance written for a group of loans that is generally securitized in the secondary market 
mortgage insurance provides loss protection to the issuer and thus increases the credit rating and pricing of the securitization 
in the primary bulk channel  we recorded billion of niw in  much of which was attributable to a forward commitment created in the fourth quarter of a large percentage of the loans contained in this single transaction had loan amounts in excess of  with ltvs greater than 
we do not expect any further production in the primary bulk channel for the foreseeable future 
structured bulk transactions  which include both primary and modified pool  are likely to vary significantly from period to period due to a the limited number of transactions occurring in this market  b the larger size of such transactions compared with primary insurance  c the level of competition from other mortgage insurers  d the relative attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancement  and e the changing loan composition and underwriting criteria of the market 
during the second half of  we viewed the structured bulk market as unsettled  with a wide variety of products that did not meet our criteria and a lack of clear direction in spreads and pricing 
in this environment  we chose to decrease our participation in structured bulk transactions and we do not expect any further production of modified pool niw in the following table provides estimates of our national market share of niw  using mica definitions  through our flow and structured bulk channels based on information available from mica and other public sources for the years ended december    and market share by channel flow channel structured bulk channel total our total market share declined in due primarily to our decision to exit the structured bulk market during the second quarter 
in addition  our flow market share declined in primarily due to the termination of two lender paid programs and the termination of production from ahm in the third quarter of according to estimates published by fannie mae  the overall mortgage loan origination market for declined approximately  and is estimated to decline another in the housing market continued to slow throughout  as evidenced by reduced sales of new and existing homes  near record high levels of unsold inventories in many markets and a general decline in home prices 
fannie mae predicts total home sales to decline by in  and another in a significant contributor to the decline in mortgage originations in the second half of was the liquidity crisis that developed in the secondary markets  which prevented many mortgage originators from selling their loans in the secondary markets 
this development contributed to the failure of a number of large national lenders and has negatively altered the outlook for mortgage originations for the foreseeable future 
many lenders have significantly reduced their emphasis on simultaneous seconds or piggyback mortgage products  which has created an opportunity for increased penetration of mortgage insurance in loan originations 
however  these piggyback mortgage products have been replaced by products with greater than ltv  which contains a higher amount of risk 
these products present a higher level of risk as home values have declined  especially in the soft market areas where home values have declined at a more rapid pace 
evidence exists that important positive changes in the market are emerging  including the development of a more stringent and pragmatic underwriting environment 
in addition  we have further tightened our underwriting guidelines to help limit our exposure to high ltv loans  especially in the distressed markets that have experienced the greatest decline in home prices 
we have limited the 
table of contents amount of reduced documentation loans that we are willing to underwrite 
we are also reducing our dependence on certain significant customers and are expanding existing relationships with customers that we believe share our focus on quality 
our enhanced quality standards will cause us to forgo some volume opportunities 
as part of our overall risk management  we monitor various risk characteristics in both our primary and modified pool niw 
the following three tables detail certain risk characteristics credit quality  loan type and ltv of our primary niw during the respective periods 
one of the risk characteristics that we pay particular attention to is credit quality 
we have defined alt a as individual loans having fico scores greater than and that have been underwritten with reduced or no documentation 
a minus is defined as loans having fico scores greater than  but less than we have defined sub prime loans as those with credit scores less than the following table summarizes the credit quality characteristics of our primary niw production during each of the last three years credit quality of primary niw prime alt a a minus sub prime total the following table summarizes the loan type characteristics of our primary niw production for the past three years 
the increase in loans with fixed rates in reflects the conversion of arm products to more predictable fixed rate loan products 
most of the potentially negative amortization loan types were the result of production in the first two quarters of production from this type of product had declined to less than by the fourth quarter of loan type of primary niw fixed arm positive amortization arm potential negative amortization total adjustable rate mortgages that include a feature allowing for a potential negative amortization pnams declined significantly in an inherent risk in a pnam loan is the scheduled milestone in which the borrower must begin making amortizing payments 
these payments can be substantially greater than the minimum payments required before the milestone is met 
while most of these pnams have interest rates that will reset on an annual basis  these loans do not have scheduled payment increases until later years  so the borrower has not been required to make an increased payment or to refinance  adding uncertainty and potential risk to this product 
we limited our exposure to pnams by reducing the number of pnams for which we provide insurance in the third quarter of we also announced guideline changes to eliminate mortgage insurance eligibility on pnams in the fourth quarter of pnam loans have experienced a higher delinquency rate than that of the remaining portfolio 
another risk characteristic that we consider in our underwriting guidelines is the ltv of the loan 
the following table summarizes the percentage of our primary production by ltv for  and loan to value of primary niw greater than to and below total the above table indicates a significant increase in the primary production of niw on loans with ltv greater than 
these loans are coming from both the flow and bulk channels 
we believe many of the greater than loans are 
table of contents the result of lenders turning away from piggyback or simultaneous second mortgages in favor of a loan product that has a higher ltv ratio 
the majority of primary bulk transactions that were included in niw consisted of loans that were greater than ltv  which impacted the overall primary stratifications by ltv as shown above 
almost all of the modified pool niw over the last three years has been in the alt a credit quality classification 
the risk associated with our modified pool niw certificates differs from primary niw in that modified pool structures in which we participate generally include either loans that have primary coverage by other insurers in front of our risk or loans that are originally written with an ltv lower than  some of which may have a simultaneous second mortgage precipitating the lower ltv 
the and structured bulk transactions that are classified as modified pool  while similar in many risk characteristics when compared to earlier years  have exhibited an earlier and greater default pattern in the early stages of development 
insurance and risk in force the following table provides detail on our direct insurance in force at december    and change change vs 
vs 
dollars in millions primary insurance flow primary insurance structured bulk insurance total primary insurance modified pool insurance total insurance our primary insurance in force grew in and in as a result of significant production during those years and improved persistency rates 
primary insurance annual persistency improved to at december  compared to at december  and at december  we anticipate that persistency rates will be maintained near current levels for based upon the slowdown of the existing housing and mortgage markets 
however  persistency could be adversely affected if interest rates decline significantly and the housing and mortgage markets begin to improve 
furthermore  if persistency were to decline  the decline may be concentrated in areas experiencing economic expansion and home price appreciation but may not decrease or may not decrease to the same degree in areas experiencing economic contraction and declining home prices 
as a result  our remaining insurance in force would be more heavily concentrated in higher risk areas  areas experiencing economic contraction and declining home prices 
the following tables provide information on selected risk characteristics of our business based on risk in force at december   and risk in force is the total amount of coverage for which we are at risk under our certificates of insurance 
the following is a list of what we believe are important indicators of increased risk that are present in our risk in force as of december  a decline in the percentage of business defined as prime credit quality  an increase in the percentage of alt a business  an increase in primary ltv greater than  an increase in pnam loan types  an increase in condominium property types  a decline in primary residence occupancy status  a growing percentage of loans in excess of  a greater concentration of risk in distressed market states  and the presence of multiple risk factors on a single insured loan

table of contents the above table reflects that certain indicators of increased risk continue to grow as a percentage of our risk in force  consistent with a general shift to these products and risk characteristics in the overall mortgage industry 
while we have limited our exposure to certain sectors in the marketplace such as sub prime and second mortgages  our portfolio contains an increased exposure to alt a loans as well as pnams 
as discussed earlier in this report  pnams contain an additional future risk when scheduled positive amortization is required in later years 
as a group  the alt a loans and the pnam loans have performed worse than the remaining prime fixed rate loans through december  we also have experienced a significant increase in the size of the mortgages for which we are providing coverage 
as noted above  loans greater than  make up an increasing percentage of our risk in force 
loans greater than  totaled of total primary risk in force at december  compared to at december  and at december  loans greater than  also totaled of total modified pool risk in force at december  compared to at december  and at december  in addition  the increase in loans with ltvs greater than  which historically produced higher default rates  has increased our risk 
due to the recent significant growth in our production and the amount of refinancing that took place in through  our insurance portfolio is relatively unseasoned  having a weighted average life of years at december  compared to years at december  and years at december  the following table shows direct risk in force as of december    and by year of loan origination

as noted above  approximately of the primary and of the modified pool risk in force at december  has been generated in and this is the result of increased production in the number of certificates and an increase in the size of the loans during these periods 
the and vintage years have so far exhibited higher default rates at this stage of development than we have historically experienced from preceding vintage years 
for additional information regarding these vintage years  see losses and expenses  below 
we also offer mortgage insurance structures designed to allow lenders to share in the risks of such insurance 
one such structure is our captive reinsurance program under which reinsurance companies that are affiliates of the lenders assume a portion of the risk associated with the lender s insured book of business in exchange for a percentage of the premium 
under the captive reinsurance program  the risk held by the captive is supported by assets held in trust with triad as the beneficiary 
at december   we had million in captive reinsurance trust balances supporting the risk transferred to captives  helping to limit our loss exposure 
approximately of our primary flow insurance in force at december  was subject to these captive arrangements compared to approximately at december  and at december  the decline of the primary flow insurance in force that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements at december  compared to december  resulted from two of our larger lender customers moving to a lender paid product that does not qualify for captive participation 
during  of our niw subject to captive reinsurance had a premium cede rate greater than 
in february  freddie mac and fannie mae each separately announced that it was temporarily changing its private 
table of contents mortgage insurer eligibility requirements so that approved mortgage insurers may not cede new risk if the premium ceded to captive reinsurers is greater than 
this temporary change is effective on or after june  this change may affect the percentage of flow niw in subject to captive reinsurance and may affect the total amount of flow niw in if lenders choose other forms of credit enhancement over mortgage insurance 
we remain committed to structuring captive reinsurance arrangements on a lender by lender basis depending on a number of considerations  including competition  market share and lender quality 
revenues a summary of the individual components of our revenue for the past three years follows change change vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands direct premium written ceded premium written net premium written change in unearned premiums   n a earned premiums net investment income total revenues we experienced strong growth in earned premiums in both and due to growth in direct premiums written in both years 
direct premium written is comprised of premiums written for both primary and modified pool business 
our direct premium written for and grew substantially as a result of increases in both insurance in force and the average basis points  which is attributable to an increase in risk characteristics in the portfolio 
primary insurance in force at december  increased compared to december  while modified pool insurance in force decreased for the same period 
overall annual persistency was at december  compared to at december  increased persistency has a positive effect on insurance in force 
ceded premium written is comprised of premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance treaties with captive as well as non captive reinsurance companies 
the growth in ceded premium written in and was not as large as the increase in direct premium written because a larger percentage of direct premiums written were not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums is the change in the unearned premium reserve  which is established primarily on premiums received on annual and single payment plans 
our unearned premium liability increased million during compared to declines of million and million  respectively  in and primarily due to the introduction of a single premium product in net investment income grew in and in primarily due to the growth in average invested assets in both years  partially offset by declines in portfolio yields 
in  the increase in investment income was also enhanced by the investment of the entire million that we drew down from our credit facility during the third quarter of average invested assets at cost or amortized cost grew by in and in as a result of the investment of positive cash flows from operations 
our investment portfolio tax equivalent yield was   and at december    and  respectively 
we anticipate a continuing decline in the overall portfolio tax equivalent yield as current interest rates remain below our average portfolio rate

net realized investment gains losses  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  are the result of our discretionary dispositions of investment securities in the context of our overall portfolio management strategies and are likely to vary significantly from period to period

net losses and lae for increased over both and primarily due to significant increases in the reserve 
the reserve increase reflects both an increase in the number of loans in default and an increase in the average risk per loan on the loans that were in default at december  we increased the frequency and severity factors utilized in the calculation of the reserve during  which also impacted the size of the reserve increase 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we identified four specific states california  florida  arizona and nevada that were experiencing declining home prices and increasing default rates at a faster pace than other states 
we collectively refer to these four states as distressed markets 
these distressed markets contributed million  or  of our total reserve increase in we experienced a significant increase in the amount of paid claims during as both the number of claims and the average severity of the paid claims increased 
the increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in and are consistent with the growth in that asset balance 
other operating expenses increased in over  reflecting the growth of our insurance in force as well as several key initiatives that have taken place in the discussion below provides more detail on both losses and expenses

dollars in thousands paid claims primary insurance modified pool insurance total number of claims paid primary insurance modified pool insurance total the amount of paid claims increased in compared to while the number of claims paid increased over the same time period 
the difference in the growth rates is due to a increase in the average severity on claims paid from  in to  in the increase in the average severity is reflective of the development of the more recent vintage years  specifically the and vintage years  which have significantly higher average loan sizes  increase in paid claims relating to loans originated in the distressed markets  which have significantly higher average loan sizes  and a reduced ability to mitigate claims 
for  both 
table of contents the amount of paid losses and the actual number of paid losses increased by approximately  which resulted in average severity remaining constant for as compared to the following table shows the average loan size and risk in force per policy by vintage year

primary modified pool average average average average vintage year loan size insured risk loan size insured risk and prior overall average the table below shows the average severity of paid claims during the past three years 
average severity on paid claims was relatively flat between and  but increased significantly in  primarily due to growth in the average amount of risk in force on paid claims 
change change vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands average severity primary insurance modified pool insurance total beginning in late  we experienced a significant reduction in our ability to mitigate claims through our traditional processes  which we believe was related to weakness in the housing market 
in some cases  properties for which loans have defaulted are sold during the foreclosure process  which generally reduces our loss 
when the property does not sell prior to foreclosure  or sells after foreclosure but prior to when the claim is paid  we often pay the full amount of our coverage  which we call a full option settlement 
full option settlements as a percentage of our paid claims have generally increased since the fourth quarter of during the second half of  the rapid decline in home prices in certain markets coupled with the overall uncertainty in the housing markets on a national basis had a significant negative impact on our ability to mitigate claims and negatively impacted the average severity 
as shown under insurance and risk in force  we are insuring a larger percentage of mortgages in excess of  claim payments on larger mortgages are greater even if coverage percentages remain constant 
claim payments on these larger mortgages are reflected by the increase in average severity during we expect severity will continue to trend upward as the average loan amounts in our portfolio continue to rise 
continued deterioration in the housing market could further reduce our loss mitigation opportunities and also contribute to increased severity in 
table of contents the table below provides the cumulative paid loss ratios by certificate year calculated as direct losses paid divided by direct premiums received  in each case for a particular policy year that have developed through december    and the data below excludes the effects of reinsurance 
cumulative paid loss ratios as of december certificate year the table above reflects relatively higher cumulative ratios of losses paid to premium received for the through policy years at this stage of development 
this is due  in part  to a large portion of this business being refinanced in subsequent years and the resulting lower aggregate level of premiums received for these policy years 
as discussed in business claims  we anticipate making higher claim payments in the second through the fifth years after the loan is originated

table of contents reacting to the rapidly changing housing markets and the shifting mix in the composition of our defaults  such as the changes in geographic location  size and policy year  we substantially increased reserves in the increase in reserves reflects a growing number of loans in default and an increase in the average risk in default  as well as increases in the frequency and severity factors utilized in our determination of the reserves 
our reserving model incorporates management s judgments and assumptions regarding the impact of the current housing and economic environment on the estimate of the ultimate claims we will pay on loans currently in default 
in addition  we noted a continued decline in our cure rates on reported defaults during the fourth quarter of accordingly  we increased the frequency factor utilized in our model by approximately in to reflect these most recent changes 
however  future economic conditions surrounding the housing or mortgage markets could significantly impact the ultimate amount of claims paid 
average loan size and vintage year of the loans entering the default pool in are notably different compared to one year earlier 
although defaults increased across the board geographically  defaults in the distressed market states california  florida  arizona and nevada increased in  compared to a increase in defaults for the remaining states during additionally  the higher average loan balance in these distressed market states has resulted in significantly higher reserve per default  all else being equal  compared to the rest of the portfolio

the following table shows default statistics as of december   and december  december  december  dollars in thousands total business number of insured loans in force with deductibles without deductibles number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default default rate percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary insurance number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default modified pool insurance number of insured loans in force with deductibles without deductibles number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary alt a business included in above number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default we do not provide reserves on modified pool defaults with deductibles until the incurred losses for that transaction reach the deductible threshold 
at december   three structured bulk transactions with deductibles as part of the structure had incurred losses that had exceeded these individual deductible amounts 

table of contents the reserves recognized in the fourth quarter for these three contracts added million to reserves at december  based upon rapid growth in the reported defaults during and the significant amount of early payment defaults in some of our vintage year structured bulk transactions  we believe that we will be providing additional reserves on certain structured bulk transactions with deductibles in given the growth of our insurance in force and the current state of the mortgage and housing market  we anticipate that our number of loans in default for both primary and modified pool insurance will continue to increase as the largest percentage of our insurance in force reaches its peak claim paying period 
we experienced an increase in the number of defaults as of december  of approximately as compared to december  accordingly  we expect reserves to continue to increase as our business continues to age 
we also expect default rates to increase for business that has increased risk characteristics such as alt a loans  higher ltv loans and pnam arms 
we expect the overall default rate to increase as the business with increased risk characteristics becomes a larger percentage of our insurance in force and as the recent vintage years reach their peak default period 
the default rate is also affected by the number of policies in force  which is the denominator in the default rate calculation 
the anticipated lower production in is also expected to result in an increase in the default rate compared to the rate that would result if our production were consistent with levels 
as discussed earlier in this report  we have experienced a faster and more severe increase in both defaults and claims on our and early vintage years 
as discussed under business defaults and claims  generally our master policies provide that we are not liable to pay a claim for loss if the application for insurance regarding the loan in question contains fraudulent information  material omissions or misrepresentations that would increase the risk characteristics of the loan 
we are currently reviewing the majority of the claims for losses and early defaults occurring soon after origination  especially with respect to the and early vintage years  to determine whether the limitations on our liability contained in our master policies are applicable 
our ability to rescind or deny coverage as described above with respect to certain loans originated by american home mortgage  formerly one of our largest customers  is limited  and is the subject of a lawsuit that american home mortgage filed against us on november  see item  legal proceedings in part i of this report 
we expect rescissions or denials of coverage for additional loans originated by american home mortgage for similar reasons  which may be the subject of further litigation 
management currently does not expect the american home mortgage rescission or denial of coverage litigation to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
as part of our overall risk management strategy  we have entered into excess of loss captive reinsurance agreements with several of our lender customers 
as detailed under business risk sharing products in part i  item of this report  we retain the first loss position on the first aggregate layer of risk and reinsure the second finite layer with the captive reinsurer with each separate policy year standing on its own 
during  for the first time since the establishment of these captives  certain captives exceeded their first loss layer in incurred losses  which resulted in the ceding of reserves of million as of december  related to specific book years 
however  we deemed  of this as potentially uncollectible as the reserves ceded to one reinsurer exceeded the current amount in the captive s trust balance 
at december   actual paid losses have not exceeded the first layer of any captive reinsurer 
if the current default and paid claim trends continue  we expect other vintage year layers and other captives to reach the attachment points on both incurred losses and paid claims  especially the and vintage years that have experienced a higher default rate at a faster pace than we have seen historically 
amortization of dac for increased moderately over  reflecting growth in the asset balance and  in some part  a reduction in our persistency assumption for policy years and thereafter from seven to five years 
a more complete discussion of the impact of persistency on dac amortization is included under deferred policy acquisition costs below 
other operating expenses increased in due to expenses incurred in connection with organizational changes  growth of the operations and costs associated with our proposed expansion into canada 
direct expenses relating to the canadian expansion amounted to approximately million for  including million in the fourth quarter  compared to none in in the first quarter of  we made the decision to suspend expansion efforts in canada and repatriate capital previously committed to canada back to the us market 
although we are currently exploring options for the canadian subsidiary  we expect our expenses related to the canadian operations to diminish in during the fourth quarter of  operating expenses in the amount of million related to

because the growth in net premiums written was greater than the growth in expenses  the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of dac and other operating expenses to net premiums written for improved to  compared to and  respectively  for and our effective tax rate was for compared to and  respectively  for and the change in the effective tax rate was due primarily to reporting an operating loss in versus operating income in and  as well as an increase in tax exempt interest resulting from growth of investments in tax preferred municipal securities 
significant customers our objective is controlled  profitable growth in both primary and modified pool business while adhering to our risk management strategies 
our strategy is to continue our focus on national lenders while maintaining the productive relationships that we have built with regional lenders 
competition within the mortgage insurance industry remains intense as many large mortgage lenders have limited the number of mortgage insurers with which they do business 
in addition  consolidation among national lenders has increased the share of the mortgage origination market controlled by the largest lenders  and that has led to further concentration of business with a relatively small number of lenders 
many of the national lenders allocate primary business to several different mortgage insurers or accept competitive bids on certain lender paid products 
these lender allocations and our success in the bidding process for lender paid products can vary over time  even quarter to quarter 
our ten largest customers were responsible for approximately   and of insurance written through the flow channel during   and  respectively 
in  we had three customers that individually were each responsible for more than of insurance written through the flow channel 
in the aggregate  these customers were responsible for approximately of insurance written through the flow channel 
in  these same three customers were responsible for approximately of insurance written through the flow channel 
in  we had two customers that individually were each responsible for more than of insurance written through the flow channel 
in the aggregate  these two customers were responsible for approximately of insurance written through the flow channel in in recent years  a significant portion of our business has been concentrated in our top two or three lender customers 
one of these customers  ahm  stopped accepting new business and ultimately filed for bankruptcy during the third quarter of for the first six months of  ahm was our single largest customer  contributing of primary niw and of modified pool niw 
another of our top customers  countrywide credit industries  inc  agreed in january to be acquired by bank of america 
bank of america is also a customer of the company  and it is unclear how this acquisition will affect our niw or competitive position going forward 
other lenders have announced contractions in personnel and have lowered their estimated production due to the unsettled nature of the mortgage marketplace 
these actions impacted production for the second half of  and we expect that we will see further reductions in production into we plan to closely monitor the ahm bankruptcy process in order to assess whether it will adversely affect other aspects of our business  although we currently cannot predict the nature or materiality of any such effects 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we announced adjustments to our underwriting guidelines 
these adjustments place limitations on maximum ltvs  minimum fico scores  acceptable documentation and various other factors 
these limitations are more restrictive in certain geographic markets 
we expect that these adjustments will result in a reduced level of niw in and the reduction in the number of lenders with which we have historically done business 
financial position total assets increased to billion at december  over december   primarily due to positive cash flows from operations and growth in invested assets 
the increase in invested assets was due in part to the investment of the million that we drew down from our credit facility during the second half of total liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   due to an increase of million in reserves for losses and the million short term borrowings on our revolving line of 
table of contents credit  offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important to the overall understanding of our financial position 
these items include dac  prepaid federal income tax and related deferred income taxes 
the majority of our assets are contained in our investment portfolio 
a separate investment portfolio section follows this financial position section and reviews our investment portfolio  key portfolio management strategies and methodologies by which we manage credit risk 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs expended to acquire new business are capitalized as dac and recognized as expense over the anticipated premium paying life of the policy in a manner that approximates the estimated premium 
we employ a dynamic model that calculates amortization of dac separately for each year of policy origination 
the model relies on assumptions that we make based upon historical industry experience and our own unique experience regarding the annual persistency development of each year of policy origination 
the base persistency assumption is the most important factor utilized in determining the timing of reported amortization expense reflected in the income statement and the carrying value of dac on the balance sheet 
a change in the assumed base persistency will impact the current and future amortization expense as well as the carrying value on the balance sheet 
during  based upon a study performed on the entire mortgage industry and specifically on our own experience  we altered our base persistency assumption on that origination year and for all future years going forward to recognize a shorter expected life due to the amount of refinancing over the past several years 
our model accelerates dac amortization through a dynamic adjustment when actual persistency for a particular year of policy origination is lower than the estimated base persistency utilized in the model 
this dynamic adjustment is capped at the levels assumed in the models  and we do not decrease dac amortization below the levels assumed in the model when persistency increases above those levels 
due to the increase in actual persistency over the past two years  the dynamic adjustment has not been as significant a factor in the quarterly dac amortization as it was during periods of high refinancing and low persistency 
the following table shows our dac asset for the previous three years and the effect of persistency on amortization dollars in thousands balance beginning of period costs capitalized amortization normal amortization dynamic adjustment total amortization balance end of period annual persistency the growth in the normal dac amortization is due to the growth in the dac asset and a decrease in the base assumption of the expected life of the flow and bulk portfolios 
assuming no significant declines in interest rates  we expect persistency to remain at the current rates or improve slightly in for further information on the accounting for dac  see critical accounting policies and estimates under item and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes we purchase ten year non interest bearing united states mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds tax and loss bonds to take advantage of a special contingency reserve deduction that mortgage guaranty companies are allowed for tax purposes 
we record these bonds on our balance sheet as prepaid federal income taxes 
purchases of tax and loss bonds are essentially a prepayment of federal income taxes that are scheduled to become current in ten years  when the contingency reserve is scheduled to be released  and the tax and loss bonds are scheduled to mature 
the scheduled proceeds from the maturity of the tax and loss bonds are used to fund the income tax payments that would be due in the same year as a result of the scheduled reversal of the contingency reserve for tax purposes 

table of contents deferred income taxes are provided for the differences in reporting taxable income in the financial statements and on the tax return 
these cumulative differences are enumerated in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the largest cumulative difference is the special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage insurers mentioned above 
during  the deferred income taxes declined by million  primarily the result of the reversal of the contingency reserve mentioned above 
the remainder of the deferred tax liability has primarily arisen from book and tax reporting differences related to dac and unrealized investment gains losses 
in years when the taxable income of a mortgage insurer shows a loss before the application of the special contingency reserve  the prior contingency reserve that was established can be reversed earlier than originally scheduled to offset the loss 
when the special contingency reserve for tax purposes is reversed earlier than the scheduled years to offset a current year operating loss  the tax and loss bonds purchased when the contingency reserve was established are redeemed earlier than originally scheduled 
during  we reversed million of contingency reserves for tax purposes earlier than originally scheduled and redeemed million of tax and loss bonds related to that reversal 
investment portfolio portfolio description our strategy for managing our investment portfolio is to optimize investment returns while preserving capital and liquidity and adhering to regulatory and rating agency requirements 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities  and the majority of these are tax preferred state and municipal bonds 
we have established a formal investment policy that describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
our investment policy and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory  economic and market conditions as well as our existing financial condition and operating requirements  including our tax position 
although we invest for the long term  we classify our debt and equity securities with readily determinable market values as available for sale 
this classification allows us the flexibility to dispose of securities in order to pursue our investment strategy and meet our operating requirements 
investments classified as available for sale are carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
investments without readily determinable market values are classified as other investments and are also carried at fair value

table of contents these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize 
changing conditions related to specific securities  overall market interest rates  overall market conditions or credit spreads  as well as our decisions concerning the timing of a sale  may impact values we ultimately realize 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
of the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities shown above  approximately  related to bonds with a maturity date in excess of ten years 
the largest individual unrealized loss on any one security at december  was approximately  on a bond issued by a government sponsored enterprise with an amortized cost of  gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 
unrealized losses are not considered to be other than temporarily impaired  as we believe we have the ability to hold investments until they recover in value or maturity 
credit risk credit risk is inherent in an investment portfolio 
we manage this risk through a structured approach to internal investment quality guidelines and diversification while assessing the effects of the changing economic landscape 
one way we attempt to limit the inherent credit risk in our portfolio is to maintain investments with high ratings 
the following table shows our investment portfolio by credit ratings 
december  december  amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands fixed maturities us treasury and agency bonds aaa aa a bbb bb ccc cc and lower not rated total fixed maturities equities preferred stocks aa a bbb common stocks total equities most of the fixed maturity bonds that have credit ratings of aaa above are the result of credit enhancements from financial guaranty insurers 
at december   many of the financial guarantors had experienced substantially weaker financial results and  as a result  their own aaa ratings are under significant pressure which  if lowered  could impact the credit rating of our portfolio 

table of contents we regularly review our entire investment portfolio to identify securities that may have suffered impairments in value that will not be recovered  termed potentially distressed securities 
in identifying potentially distressed securities  we screen all securities held with a particular emphasis on those that have a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
additionally  as part of this identification process  we utilize the following information length of time the fair value was below amortized cost  industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area negatively affecting the security  downgrades by a rating agency  past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants  and deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer 
in analyzing our potentially distressed securities list for other than temporary impairments  we pay special attention to securities that have been on the list continually for a period greater than six months 
our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value is also considered 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than nine months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment advisors  improving financial performance of the issuer  or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we conclude that a decline is other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
of the approximate million of gross unrealized losses at december   securities with a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than had a combined unrealized loss of approximately  information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
the values of securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will the values of securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
realized losses and impairments realized losses include both write downs of securities with other than temporary impairments and losses from the sales of securities 
we wrote down securities  including other investments  by a total of approximately million   and  during   and  respectively  due to other than temporary declines in fair value 
during  we wrote down the entire carrying value of structured credit holdings  a million equity investment that was previously carried as other investments 
liquidity and capital resources generally  our sources of operating funds consist of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is generally applied to the payment of claims  interest  expenses and prepaid federal income taxes in the form of tax and loss bond purchases 
during  the early redemption of tax and loss bonds due to the significant increase in loss reserves provided a source of funds see prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes for information on the tax and loss bonds 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to million for and million for the increase in cash flow from operating activities reflects the strong growth in 
table of contents premiums and investment income received  partially offset by increases in paid losses and operating expenses 
a significant factor impacting the increase was the early redemption of million of previously purchased tax and loss bonds  which served as a source of cash in the current year 
during and  we purchased tax and loss bonds which had the effect of reducing operating cash flow by million and million  respectively 
we anticipate the early redemption of tax and loss bonds to continue to be a source of cash in and in  we experienced significant operating losses  primarily the result of an increase in loss reserves of million  which did not immediately impact our cash flow 
generally  there is about a to month delay from when reserves are initially established on a default to when a claim is ultimately paid 
in  paid losses amounted to million  however  we expect paid losses to increase significantly in we anticipate that the majority of this cash outflow requirement related to the payment of claims in will be met by premiums and investment income  however  the liquidation of some short term investments may be required to meet the expected paid loss requirements 
positive operating cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
we attempt to match the maturities of our invested assets to the anticipated timing of the payments of claims and expenses 
maturities within our fixed income investment portfolio have been structured to provide options to reinvest those funds or have such funds available to meet operating cash needs  such as the payment of claims 
at december   maturities scheduled within the next twelve months within our fixed income portfolio amount to million 
an operating cash flow shortfall  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
our business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to our computer systems and technological capabilities 
on june   the company entered into a three year  million unsecured revolving credit facility with three domestic banks to provide short term liquidity for insurance operations and general corporate purposes 
on august   we drew down million under the credit facility and it continued to remain outstanding through year end 
in december  we utilized a portion of the funds provided through the credit facility to provide a million capital contribution to triad in anticipation of funds being repatriated from our canadian subsidiary 
in january  we repatriated million of the original million originally invested in our canadian subsidiary 
under the credit agreement  the company must maintain a minimum adjusted consolidated net worth level of million at december   and must not exceed a statutory risk to capital ratio threshold of to the agreement also contains covenants restricting the company s ability to incur liens  merge or consolidate with another entity and dispose of all or substantially all of its assets 
in addition  the parent company is restricted from the payment of dividends if the company is in default or if the payment of dividends places the company in default 
at december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
if the company were to violate any of the covenants requiring the repayment of the million drawn down under the credit facility  there remains adequate funds including the million repatriated from our canadian subsidiary in january at the parent level to repay the debt 
our risk to capital ratio has risen dramatically over the past year  driven primarily by significant increases in our risk in force during the past months and operating losses we incurred in the last two quarters of we believe the housing and mortgage markets in will continue to be adversely affected by a number of factors  including declining home prices  an oversupply of homes offered for sale and increased foreclosures  particularly in certain distressed markets 
we expect we will incur additional operating losses as new defaults are reported 
based on our internal projections  we must significantly augment our capital resources in the second quarter of in order to preserve our ability to continue to write new insurance 
since the fourth quarter of  we have been working with a prominent financial advisory firm to pursue alternatives for enhancing our capital 
we have not yet succeeded in obtaining any commitments for an investment in our company  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such commitments in the future 
the proposals that have been considered involve structures under which triad would implement a run off plan and a newly formed mortgage insurer would acquire certain of triad s employees  infrastructure  sales force and insurance underwriting operations 
in addition  we would cease writing new business 
these proposals do not 
table of contents involve a direct investment in triad 
completing any such transaction would be subject to numerous conditions  including obtaining necessary consents and approvals from our stockholders  the illinois department of insurance and other state insurance regulatory authorities  the gses  rating agencies and other third parties 
no assurance can be given that such consents and approvals could be obtained or that we can complete any such transaction 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we would have any ownership interest in any new mortgage insurer formed to acquire assets of triad or have any opportunity to share in the potential financial returns available from insurance written by such an insurer 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that an insurance subsidiary can pay its parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois department of insurance 
in addition to these statutory limitations on dividends  illinois regulations provide that a mortgage guaranty insurer may not declare any dividends except from undivided profits remaining on hand over and above the amount of its policyholder reserve 
in the second quarter of  triad declared and paid a dividend of million to its parent company to partially fund the initial capital required to commence business in canada 
in the fourth quarter of  the parent company made an additional capital contribution of million to triad that was recorded as additional paid in capital on the books of triad 
included in policyholders surplus of the us insurance subsidiary  triad  is a surplus note of million payable to the registrant  its parent 
the surplus note is included as statutory capital for the purpose of the calculation of all regulatory ratio analyses 
the accrual of and payment of the interest on the surplus note must be approved by the illinois department of insurance 
additionally  specific covenants of triad s surplus note prohibit the accrual of or payment of interest on the note if the most recently reported policyholders surplus is below the level at the time the note was originated 
at year end  based upon the most recent statutory filings with the illinois department of insurance september   reported total policyholders surplus was below the level at the time the note was originated 
therefore  triad did not request approval to accrue the interest on the surplus note at year end nor did we request approval to pay the interest on the scheduled due date of january  the statutory filings at december  included a release of the contingency reserve that resulted in policyholders surplus at a level greater than that when the surplus note was originated 
we have requested the approval from the illinois department of insurance to accrue and pay the interest on the million surplus note  but as of this date  we have not received its approval 
debt service on the million long term debt amounts to million per year 
the primary source of the cash flow for the debt service comes from the interest on the million surplus note at triad  which provides million on an annual basis 
if triad is unable to pay the scheduled debt service on the million surplus note to its parent for an extended period of time  the holding company may be unable to continue to meet its debt service obligations on the million long term debt 
as of december  there are no specific restrictions or requirements for capital support arrangements between the parent company and triad or its subsidiaries 
an agreement between the parent company and triad  which was approved by our primary regulator  exists that allows for the reimbursement of expenses by triad to the parent company for expenses 
we cede business to captive reinsurance affiliates of certain mortgage lenders  primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust accounts where we are the sole beneficiary 
when ceded loss reserves exceed the trust balances  we address the counter party credit risk of the reinsurance recoverable on a case by case basis and provide for a provision for uncollectible accounts where appropriate 
total stockholders equity declined to million at december   from million at december  this decrease resulted primarily from our net loss of million  offset by an increase in additional paid in capital of million resulting from activity related to share based compensation and the associated tax benefit 

table of contents statutory capital  for the purpose of computing the net risk in force to statutory capital ratio  includes both policyholders surplus and the contingency reserve 
the following table provides information regarding our statutory capital position at december  and december  december  dollars in millions statutory policyholders surplus statutory contingency reserve total the primary differences between statutory policyholders surplus and equity computed under generally accepted accounting principles are the statutory contingency reserve  dac and deferred income taxes 
generally  mortgage insurance companies are required to add to the statutory contingency reserve through a charge to surplus an amount equal to of calendar year earned premiums and retain the contingency reserve in the statutory statements for a period of ten years 
the contingency reserve can be released earlier than the scheduled ten years if the loss ratio exceeds 
the loss ratio substantially exceeded in and marginally exceeded in accordingly  we released approximately million and million of contingency reserve surplus in and  respectively 
triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings 
generally  states limit triad s statutory risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december  the growth in the risk to capital ratio in was the result of significant increases in production in the first half of the year and operating losses in the last two quarters 
the risk to capital ratio is calculated using net risk in force as the numerator and statutory capital as the denominator 
net risk in force accounts for risk ceded under reinsurance arrangements  including captive risk sharing arrangements  as well as any applicable stop loss limits and deductible amounts on structured transactions 
several states  including triad s domiciliary state  illinois  require detailed calculations of risk to capital that differentiate risk between ltvs  coverage percentage  and type of product 
as of december   triad s statutory capital was approximately of the minimum capital required by the illinois department of insurance and tgac s statutory capital was approximately of the minimum required capital 
at december   triad was rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
on february   s p placed its ratings of triad on credit watch with negative outlook or implications indicating that ratings on triad could be lowered multiple notches or affirmed with a negative outlook 
on january   moody s placed its ratings of triad on review for possible downgrade 
on october   fitch placed triad on rating watch negative as it addresses the revisions implemented in its proprietary capital model for us mortgage insurers and related performance of the more recent vintage years 
all three rating agencies are in the process of reviewing their ratings outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry 
a further reduction in triad s ratings or a significant deterioration in the ratings outlook could impact our ability to write new business and jeopardize our gse rating as a type or type i mortgage insurer 
see part i  item a  risk factors in this report for further discussion relating to potential ratings downgrades 
fannie mae and freddie mac both have approval requirements for mortgage insurers and differentiate between services and the amount of insurance allowed depending upon the tier the mortgage insurer qualifies for under their requirements 
if our ratings fall below the equivalent of aa and if either fannie mae or freddie mac or both determine that we would not qualify as a type or type i mortgage insurer  respectively  lenders may limit the amount of mortgage insurance that they would place with us  which would significantly impair our competitive position in the mi industry and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
additionally  both fannie mae and freddie mac as well as other investors have the ability to redirect renewal premiums to other mortgage insurers that meet the type or type i requirements  respectively  if they determine a lower tier mortgage insurer is a risk for the payment of claims 
if triad were to fail to meet the requirements to qualify as a type or type i mortgage insurer  respectively  and fannie mae or freddie mac or both redirected renewal premiums to higher rated mortgage insurers  then it would have a significant negative impact on future results of operations 
see part i  item  
table of contents financial strength rating and part i  item a  risk factors in this report for further discussion on the qualification standards of fannie mae and freddie mac 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties  including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for ofheo s risk based capital rules is ten years 
at present  no private mortgage insurer is rated higher than aa and based upon the overall negative outlook for mortgage insurers presently  we do not believe these rules will have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition or operations in the future 
however  if the risk based capital rules result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  our operations and financial condition could be significantly impacted

the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
market risk exposure fixed maturity securities represented approximately of our invested assets at december  based on amortized cost 
while the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates  a change in market interest rates would not immediately impact results of operations because we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity 
however  a decrease in market interest rates generally will have the effect of initiating an early call provision of those securities possessing such provisions 
the proceeds relating to the early called securities in a decreasing interest rate environment generally are invested in lower yielding investments that would ultimately decrease results of operations 
our long term debt matures in with no early call or put provisions and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates  however  a change in rates would not impact results of operations 
we believe that a increase or decrease in market interest rates is reasonable for the upcoming year 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would not have a material impact on results of operations during 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
in developing these estimates  we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
also  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae we calculate our best estimate of the reserve for losses to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default  as of the date of our financial statements 
additionally  we provide a reserve for loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us incurred but not reported using an estimate based on the percentage of actual reported defaults 
our reserving process incorporates various components in a model that gives effect to current economic conditions and segments defaults by a variety of criteria 
the criteria include  among others  policy year  lender  geography and the number of months and number of times the policy has been in default  as well as whether the defaults were underwritten as flow business or as part of a structured bulk transaction 
frequency and severity are the two most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves 
frequency is used to estimate the ultimate number of paid claims associated with the current defaulted loans 
the frequency estimate assumes that long term historical experience  taking into consideration criteria such as those described in the preceding paragraph  and adjusted for current economic conditions that we believe will significantly impact the long term loss development  provides a reasonable basis for forecasting the number of claims that will be paid 
severity is the estimate of the dollar amount per claim that will be paid 
the severity factors are estimates of the percentage of the risk in force that will be paid 
the severity factors used are based on an analysis of the severity rates of recently paid claims  applied to the risk in force of the loans currently in default 
the frequency and severity factors are updated quarterly 
economic conditions and other data upon which these factors are based may change more frequently than once a quarter 
therefore  significant changes in reserve requirements may become evident three or more months following the underlying events that would necessitate the change 
the estimation of loss reserves requires assumptions as to future events  and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions 
economic conditions that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future in either a similar manner or degree 
to provide a measure of the sensitivity on pretax income and loss reserves carried on the balance sheet  we have provided the following table that quantifies the impact of percentage increases and decreases in both the average frequency and severity as of december  sensitivity analysis effect on pretax income from changes in assumptions decrease in factors increase in factors resulting in an resulting in a increase in pretax decrease in pretax income income dollars in thousands increase decrease in the frequency factors utilized in the loss reserve model increase decrease in the severity factors utilized in the loss reserve model increase decrease in both the frequency and severity factors utilized in the loss reserve model the impact on loss reserves on the balance sheet would be to decrease reserves for favorable developments and to increase reserves for unfavorable developments 
there would be no impact on liquidity resulting from the change in reserves 
however  there would be a change in cash or invested assets equal to the increase or decrease in the 
table of contents ultimate paid claims related to the change in reserves 
we believe that a increase or decrease in frequency or severity is reasonably likely based on potential changes in future economic conditions and past experience  although we believe there is a greater propensity during for an increase in the frequency and severity factors given the current conditions of the housing market 
economic conditions that could give rise to an increase in the frequency rate could be a sudden increase or a prolonged period of increase in the unemployment rate or a continued downward trend in home prices while  conversely  an improved housing market  a sudden drop in interest rates or a sustained period of economic and job growth could decrease the frequency rate 
any factor that would affect our ability to sell a home of a borrower in default prior to foreclosure would affect our severity 
the most prominent of these would be the value of the underlying home 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by our loss reserve process 
our loss reserve estimation process and our analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded in our financial statements

investments valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid  publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix developed by our outside investment advisors for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning a the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  b credit quality and c expected maturity 
much of our fixed maturity municipal bond portfolio contains credit enhancements that guarantee the payments of principal and interest 
this guarantee is generally provided by aaa rated financial guaranty companies and has resulted in most of these securities being at the highest credit rating 
many of the financial guaranty companies that provide the credit enhancement on our municipal bond portfolio are currently in jeopardy of being downgraded below aaa by the rating agencies or already have been downgraded below aaa 
as a result  the ratings of the bonds they insure will generally be downgraded as well 
as a result  we have examined the underlying credit on the individual securities to determine if an other than temporary impairment has taken place 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and any other than temporary impairments are charged against results of operations in the proper period 
the timely identification and valuation of potentially impaired securities involves many judgments 
the most significant judgments that we make relate to the estimated future cash flows on potentially impaired securities and our intent and ability to hold a security to anticipated recovery of value 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
for a further discussion of the valuation of our investment portfolio and the methodology we use to identify potential impairments  see investment portfolio above 
deferred policy acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business  principally sales compensation and certain policy underwriting and issue costs that are primarily related to the production of new business  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
amortization of dac is charged to expense in proportion to premiums recognized over the estimated policy life 
we make judgments in the determination of estimated policy life utilized in the amortization assumptions 
the most significant judgment that we make related to dac is the estimated life of the asset 
we review the persistency of policies in force and make appropriate adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs to reflect actual policy cancellations 
we also prepare an analysis to determine that the dac on our balance sheet is recoverable against the future profits of our existing book of business 
the critical assumptions that we utilize in assessing the recoverability of the dac is the persistency of the premium stream and the amount and timing of paid losses 
we make our best estimate of the persistency and claim patterns based upon the information available at the time 
because these estimates of persistency and amount of and timing of claims are 
table of contents sensitive to future economic events  these estimates may change in the future
