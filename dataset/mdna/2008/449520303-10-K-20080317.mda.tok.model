item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  impairment loss on investments 
we continue to hold approximately million shares of hapc common stock 
if the fair value of hapc common stock declines further and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  or if we sell shares of hapc at lower than our current cost basis  any resulting impairment charges under sfas or capital loss on sale of the shares would have an adverse effect on our net income or increase our net losses 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and to report on  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with section and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective in the years ended december  and our independent registered public accounting firm also expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and we have since resolved the material weaknesses  but if we fail to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in the future  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we cannot provide assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section if we fail to achieve and maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
risk factors related specifically to our common stock the average trading volume for our common stock is relatively low when compared to most larger companies 
as a result  there may be less liquidity and more volatility associated with our common stock  even if our business is doing well 
our common stock has been traded publicly since february   and since then has had only a few market makers 
the average daily trading volume for our shares during the three months ended december  was approximately  shares 
there can be no assurance that a more active or established trading market for our common stock will develop or  if developed  will be maintained 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
market prices for securities of biotechnology and medical device companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that appear unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors  among others  can have a significant effect on the market price of our securities announcements of technological innovations  new products  or clinical studies by us or others  
table of contents government regulation  changes in the coverage or reimbursement rates of private insurers and governmental agencies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by existing stockholders or by us  and comments by securities analysts and general market conditions 
the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could also have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders or holders of awards under our equity incentive plans could negatively affect the market price of our stock and make it more difficult for us to sell stock in the future 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to complete future equity financings 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock and shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and warrants may be resold pursuant to currently effective registration statements 
as of december   there were  shares of common stock that are freely tradable in the public markets   shares of restricted stock that are subject to outstanding awards under our equity incentive plan   shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants which have been registered for resale under a registration statement on form s registration no 
 and an aggregate of  shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding awards under our various equity incentive plans  including shares of restricted stock units and stock options 
we cannot estimate the number of shares of common stock that may actually be resold in the public market because this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers  and other factors 
if stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
anti takeover devices may prevent a sale  or changes in the management  of i flow 
we have in place several anti takeover devices  including a stockholder rights plan  that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a sale  or changes in the management  of i flow 
for example  one anti takeover device provides for a board of directors that is separated into three classes  with their terms in office staggered over three year periods 
this has the effect of delaying a change in control of the board of directors without the cooperation of the incumbent board 
in addition  our bylaws do not allow stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders or act by written consent  and also require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting 
we may also issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and on terms that our board of directors may determine in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not pay dividends and this may negatively affect the price of our stock 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the future price of our common stock may be adversely impacted because we do not pay dividends 

table of contents in the future  our common stock may be removed from listing on the nasdaq global market and may not qualify for listing on any stock exchange  in which case it may be difficult to find a market in our stock 
if our common stock is no longer traded on a national trading market  it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares  and the price of our common stock would likely be negatively affected 
currently  our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
nasdaq has a number of continued listing requirements  including a minimum trading price requirement 
failure to comply with any nasdaq continued listing requirement could cause our common stock to be removed from listing 
should this occur  we may not be able to secure listing on other exchanges or quotation systems  and this would have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock

as of november   the latest date reported by hapc  the million shares held by the company constitute approximately of the issued and outstanding common stock of hapc 
on october   because hapc was unable to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the acquisition by such date  a termination fee of million pursuant to the definitive agreement  as amended  became unconditionally due and owing to the company  regardless of whether or not the transaction was subsequently consummated 
on october   the shareholders of hapc approved the acquisition of infusystem

the company s products are predominately assembled from common subassembly components in a single integrated manufacturing facility  and operating results are reviewed by management on a combined basis including all products as opposed to several operating segments 
the company believes it is most meaningful for the purposes of revenue analyses  however  to group the product lines into two categories representing specific clinical applications regional anesthesia and iv infusion therapy 
regional anesthesia product revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased clinical usage of the on q painbuster post operative pain relief system and c bloc continuous nerve block system by surgeons in the united states 
revenue from the c bloc continuous nerve block systems increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to improved customer awareness of clinical efficacy and favorable reimbursement from third parties

as a percentage of net product sales  product cost of revenues decreased for the year ended december  by approximately one percentage point compared to the prior year 
the decrease in cost of revenues is primarily due to the favorable change in sales mix toward high margin regional anesthesia products 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses from continuing operations increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and related expenses million  commissions million  travel and entertainment expenses million  consulting million  advertising and promotions expenses million  employee training expenses million and marketing samples million

product development expenses product development expenses from continuing operations include research and development for new products and the cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals of products and processes 
product development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of patents and increase in compensation and related expenses that resulted from an increase in the number of

with the shares purchased as of that date  the company owned approximately of the issued and outstanding hapc common stock and disclosed its intentions to vote such shares in favor of the acquisition 
as of november   the latest date reported by hapc  the million shares held by the company constitute approximately of the issued and outstanding common stock of hapc 
since the time the shares of hapc common stock were purchased by the company  the share price of hapc common stock has significantly decreased from the company s purchase price of per share 
as of december   the company has determined that the decline in the fair value of the investment in hapc common stock was other than temporary based primarily on the significant decline in the market value and its intent to sell the investment in the short term 
as such  the company recorded the impairment loss and established a new cost basis in the investment as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  from continuing operations increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased investment income from higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by approximately million from prior year due to the cash proceeds received from the sale of infusystem in october income taxes income tax benefit from continuing operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was due to a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets with an incremental tax benefit of approximately million that was recorded during the year ended december  the remaining valuation allowance relates to temporary timing differences that are not currently determined to be more likely than not to be realized 
the income tax benefit was consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which addresses financial accounting for deferred tax assets 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that projected future taxable income will be insufficient to recover the deferred tax assets 
in the event the company is unable to operate at a profit and unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  it would be required to increase the valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets 
in the design and improvement of its products  i flow incurs research and development costs that qualify for federal and state tax credits

sfas 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates

r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  but retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions be used for all business combinations 
sfas r expands on the disclosures previously required by sfas  better defines the acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination  and establishes principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired business 
sfas r also requires an acquirer to record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to acquired businesses 
sfas r is effective for all business combinations with an acquisition date in the first annual period following december   early adoption is not permitted 
sfas r will be effective january  accordingly  the company will continue to record and disclose business combinations  including the acquisition of acrymed on february   following sfas until january  the company expects sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the critical accounting policies that the company believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title  when evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers the right of return for defective products and continuously monitors and tracks product returns 
the company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
although returns have historically been insignificant  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates as it has in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the returns materialize 
the company does not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment and passage of title has occurred  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes rental revenues  which is recorded in discontinued operations  from medical pumps over the term of the related agreement  generally on a month to month basis 
pump rentals are billed at the company s established rates  which often significantly differ from contractually allowable rates provided by third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance carriers 
the company records net rental revenues at the estimated realizable amounts from patients and third party payors 
the company experiences significant delays in payment with certain of these third party payors  but it continuously monitors reimbursement rates of the third party payors and the timing of such payments 
any change in reimbursement or collection rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified 

table of contents accounts receivable the company performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances 
it records an allowance for bad debts based on the estimated collectibility of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
the company applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable agings to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age 
if the actual uncollected amounts are less than the previously estimated allowance  a favorable adjustment would result 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly and adversely affected 
inventories the company values inventory on a part by part basis at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis and the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory on specifically identified items based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next two years 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and thus the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company seeks to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
short term investments the company considers all highly liquid interest earning investments with a maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments with a maturity beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
all short term investments are classified as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  and are recorded at fair market value based on quoted market prices using the specific identification method  unrealized gains and losses excluding other than temporary impairments are reflected in other comprehensive loss 
the company determined that there was an other than temporary impairment on its investment in hapc common stock as of december  based primarily on the significant decline in the market value and its intent to sell the investment in the short term and as a result recorded an impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter of and established a new cost basis in the investment as of december  in accordance with sfas if the fair value of hapc common stock declines further and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  or if the company sells shares of hapc at lower than the current cost basis  any resulting impairment charges under sfas or capital loss on sale of the shares would have an adverse effect on the company s net income or increase net losses 
deferred taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 

table of contents in july the fasb issued fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of federal and state tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
as a result of these adjustments  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
stock based compensation beginning january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
the principal objective of the company s asset management activities is to maximize net investment income while maintaining acceptable levels of credit and interest rate risk and facilitating its funding needs

approximately of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments have maturity dates of days or less from the date acquired and approximately have maturity dates of greater than days but not more than days 
the company is susceptible to market value fluctuations with regard to the company s short term investments 
however  due to the relatively short maturity period of those investments and based on their highly liquid nature  the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significant 
foreign currency the company has a subsidiary in mexico 
as a result  the company is exposed to potential transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company has not and currently does not hedge or enter into derivative contracts in an effort to address foreign exchange risk
