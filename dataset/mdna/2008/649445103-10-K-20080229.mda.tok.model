table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank the community bank and new york commercial bank the commercial bank collectively  the banks 
executive summary largely reflecting our growth through a series of eight business combinations since november  we are currently the fourth largest bank holding company headquartered in the new york metropolitan region  and rank among the leading depositories in the markets we serve 
in our years of public life  we have grown from a savings bank with assets of billion and seven branches in queens and nassau counties to a multi bank holding company with assets of billion  two bank subsidiaries one savings and one commercial and branches serving customers in all five boroughs of new york city  long island  and westchester county in new york  and essex  hudson  mercer  middlesex  monmouth  ocean  and union counties in new jersey 
our financial performance is driven by a business model with four primary components the origination of multi family loans  primarily on rent regulated buildings in new york city  the maintenance of conservative underwriting standards  the efficient operation of our company  and the growth of our franchise through accretive merger transactions  and the strategic post merger repositioning of our balance sheet 
our performance reflected the merits of our business model and the increasing strength and quality of our balance sheet the nature of our lending niche  and the consistency of our underwriting standards  enabled us to extend our record of asset quality 
was our th consecutive year without any losses in our multi family niche 
non performing assets represented of total assets at december   an improvement from at december  non performing loans represented of loans outstanding  consistent with the measure recorded at the prior year end 
charge offs totaled  and represented of average loans in  comparable to the  of charge offs recorded in in both years  the charge offs consisted of consumer and unsecured credits that had been acquired in our various business combinations 
the unique structure of our multi family loans contributed to the growth of our net interest income and margin  as refinancing activity and property sales increased in the first nine months of the year 
prepayment penalty income rose million  or  year over year  to million in the increase in prepayment penalty income combined with the replenishment of our loan portfolio with higher yielding credits to generate a year over year increase in the average yield on our interest earning assets to in from in with the completion of three acquisitions in  we expanded our branch network  increased our share of deposits  contained our funding costs  and boosted our revenues 
the acquisitions of pennfed financial services  inc pennfed and synergy financial group  inc synergy on april and october  added branches to our community bank franchise in new jersey  increasing our presence in essex  hudson  and union counties  and extending our footprint into mercer  middlesex  monmouth  and ocean counties in the central part of the state 

table of contents our share of deposits rose from to in these counties  improving our rank among the region s thrifts from th to fifth 
the acquisition of new york city based branches from doral bank  fsb doral on july  boosted our commercial bank franchise to branches  including in the boroughs of manhattan  brooklyn  and queens 
deposits rose million to billion over the course of  as the deposits and excess liquidity we derived from our three acquisitions enabled us to engage in a strategic run off of certain higher cost funding  and to price our deposits conservatively as others raised their rates in order to compete 
the acquisitions also contributed to an increase in fee and other income  which totaled million in  a million  or  increase from the amount recorded in each of our acquisitions  and the balance sheet repositioning that followed the pennfed transaction  contributed to a year over year increase in our net interest income and the year over year expansion of our net interest margin 
in the second quarter of the year  we sold billion of the loans acquired in the pennfed transaction  either in whole or securitized form 
in the third quarter of the year  we sold billion of lower yielding mortgage related securities 
the cash flows from loan and securities sales in the second and third quarters were primarily deployed into higher yielding interest earning assets  a portion of the cash flows produced in the second quarter were used to reduce our higher cost wholesale funds 
our net interest income rose million  or  year over year to million  while our net interest margin expanded by basis points to 
in addition  the sale of our atlantic bank headquarters for million early in the third quarter generated an after tax gain of million  or per diluted share 
the doral transaction provided us with an alternative location in manhattan to serve as the headquarters for the atlantic bank division of the commercial bank 
notwithstanding an acquisition driven increase in operating expenses  we continued to rank among the top of all banks and thrifts in the nation on the basis of our efficiency 
in  our efficiency ratio was 
earnings growth and capital strength while several factors contributed to our financial performance  the preceding achievements were the primary drivers of the year s results 
reflecting our actions during the year  our earnings rose from million in to million in during this time  our diluted earnings per share rose from to at december   our stockholders equity totaled billion and represented of total assets  as compared to billion  representing of total assets  at december  during this time  our tangible stockholders equity rose million  or  to billion  and the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets rose basis points to 
please see the reconciliations of our stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity and the related measures on page of this report 
reflecting the strength of our capital  and our financial performance  we distributed million to our shareholders in  in the form of a per share dividend per quarter  annualized 

table of contents recent events dividend declaration on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as being critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
certain accounting policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of our financial condition  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provisions for loan losses charged to operations and reduced by net charge offs or reversals 
a separate loan loss allowance is established for the community bank and the commercial bank and  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each 
management establishes the allowances for loan losses through an assessment of probable losses in each of the respective loan portfolios 
several factors are considered in this process  including the level of defaulted loans at the close of each quarter  recent trends in loan performance  historical levels of loan losses  the factors underlying such loan defaults and loan losses  projected default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  loan size  economic  industry  and environmental factors  and loan impairment  as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas nos 
and  a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply sfas nos 
and as necessary to certain larger multi family  commercial real estate  construction  and commercial and industrial c i loans  and exclude smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
the company measures impairment of collateralized loans based on the fair value of the collateral  less estimated costs to sell 
for loans that are not collateral dependent  impairment is measured by using the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
a valuation allowance is established when the fair value or the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
we had no impaired loans at december  in addition  the process of determining the appropriate level for the banks loan loss allowances includes  but is not limited to periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  full assessment by the pertinent board of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes of the future level of the allowance for loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
in establishing the loan loss allowances  management also considers the banks current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with conservative guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
in accordance with the pertinent policies  the loan loss allowances are segmented to correspond to the various types of loans in the loan portfolios 
these loan categories are assessed with specific emphasis on the internal risk ratings  underlying collateral  credit underwriting  and loan type 
these factors correspond to the respective levels of quantified and inherent risk 

table of contents the assessments take into consideration loans that have been adversely rated  primarily through the valuation of the collateral supporting each loan 
adversely rated loans are loans that are either non performing or that exhibit certain weaknesses that could jeopardize payment in accordance with the original terms 
larger loans are assigned risk ratings based upon a routine review of the credit files  while smaller loans exceeding days in arrears are assigned risk ratings based upon an aging schedule 
quantified risk factors are assigned for each risk rating category to provide an allocation to the overall loan loss allowance 
the remainder of each loan portfolio is then assessed  by loan type  with similar risk factors being considered  including the borrower s ability to pay and our past loan loss experience with each type of loan 
these loans are also assigned quantified risk factors  which result in allocations to the allowances for loan losses for each particular loan or loan type in the portfolio 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank  as applicable 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the respective loan loss allowances may be necessary  based on changes in economic and local market conditions beyond management s control 
in addition  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations 
the company recognizes interest income on loans using the interest method over the life of the loan 
the company defers certain loan origination and commitment fees  and certain loan origination costs  and amortizes the net fee or cost as an adjustment to the loan yield over the term of the related loan  using the interest method 
when a loan is sold or repays  the remaining net unamortized fee or cost is recognized in interest income 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  the company ceases the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and or the company has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
interest income on non accrual loans is recorded when received in cash 
investment securities the securities portfolio consists of mortgage related securities  and debt and equity other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of our securities  particularly our fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying value is other than temporary 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount at the time of testing  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  we have identified one reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value  using the quoted market price of our common stock on the impairment testing date as the basis for determining fair value 
as of the annual impairment test date  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
in addition  we found no indication of goodwill impairment when we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january  
table of contents income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based on the amount we expect to owe the various taxing authorities ie  federal  state  and local 
income taxes represent the net estimated amount due to  or to be received from  such taxing authorities 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall tax position 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination was made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
balance sheet summary largely reflecting the benefit of our three acquisitions and organic loan production  total assets grew to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase largely reflects a million rise in total loans to billion  together with an million rise in total securities to billion

loans loans are  and have historically been  our principal asset  and represented billion  or  of total assets at december  at december   loans totaled billion  and represented of total assets at that date 
our primary lending niche is new york city s multi family real estate market 
we are a leading producer of multi family loans in the city  with an emphasis on loans secured by buildings that are rent controlled or rent stabilized 
according to the housing supply report published by the nyc rent guidelines board  rent regulated units comprise approximately of the city s rental housing market 
multi family loans represented billion  or  of total loans at december   while commercial real estate loans represented billion  or 
construction loans accounted for billion  or  of total loans at the end of december  while other loans accounted for million  representing 
of the latter amount  million  or  consisted of commercial and industrial c i loans 

table of contents while we also originate one to four family loans  we do so on a pass through basis only  selling such loans to a third party conduit shortly after the loans are closed 
as a result  one to four family loans represented a modest million  or  of total loans at december   and primarily consisted of loans acquired through our various business combinations 
the modest level of loan growth we recorded in was attributable to a variety of factors  most notably including the competitive nature of our multi family niche 
during the year  as in  many of our competitors were offering loans at terms that were inconsistent with our underwriting standards 
as a result  we chose to limit our lending rather than compromise our standards in order to compete 
another factor that contributed to the limited level of loan growth was the post merger repositioning of our balance sheet 
while we added loans in all three of our business combinations  the increase was largely offset by the sale of certain whole and securitized loans acquired in the transaction with pennfed 
in addition to acquired loans and the purchase of loans totaling million  the growth of our loan portfolio at december  reflects twelve month originations of billion  a million reduction from the volume produced in the prior year 
multi family loans accounted for billion  or  of loans produced in  and commercial real estate loans accounted for million  or 
in  multi family loans represented of loans originated  with commercial real estate loans accounting for of total loans produced 
construction loans represented million  or  of total loans produced in  a significant reduction from million  representing of total loans produced  in the prior year 
by comparison  c i loans represented billion  or  of loan production  as compared to million  representing of the total  in the level of loan growth we achieved during the year was largely tempered by repayments of billion  most of which were received in the first three quarters of  as many property owners took advantage of favorable market conditions to either sell or refinance their properties 
as a result  we recorded prepayment penalty income of million in  exceeding the year earlier level by million  or 
the favorable impact of prepayment penalty income on our net interest income and net income is further discussed in the earnings summary later in this report 
loan growth was also tempered by sales of billion  primarily in connection with the post merger repositioning of the balance sheet following the acquisition of pennfed

while the transactions with pennfed  doral  and synergy contributed to our balance of multi family loans at december   the majority of loans added during the year were organically produced 
multi family loans accounted for billion  or  of the year s originations  as compared to billion  or  in the prior year 
at december   billion  or  of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings  with the remainder of the portfolio being secured by underlying mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings 
in addition  of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest share 
another of multi family loans were secured by buildings on long island  other parts of new york state  new jersey  and pennsylvania  with the remaining secured by buildings outside our primary market  many of which are owned by borrowers we have made loans to successfully within our local marketplace 
we primarily underwrite our multi family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the building  utilizing the income method of appraising the properties  rather than the sales approach  which is subject to fluctuations in real estate market conditions and the general economy 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the physical condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the amount of a multi family loan generally represents no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property  with an amortization period of up to years 
in addition to requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  we require a security interest in the personal property at the premises  and an assignment of rents and leases 
at december   the average multi family loan had a balance of million and the portfolio had an average loan to value ratio of 
in addition to qualifying a multi family loan on the basis of the building s income and condition  we consider the borrower s credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the building s rent rolls  and we also generally review their financial statements and related documents 
because of our longevity in the multi family market and the tendency of borrowers to refinance  we also are able  in many cases  to consider our own prior experience with the owner of the property 

table of contents multi family loans are typically made to long term property owners who utilize the funds they borrow to make improvements to the building and the apartments therein 
our multi family loans generally feature a term of ten years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten 
the rate charged in the first five years is generally based on the five year constant maturity treasury rate the five year cmt plus a spread 
during years six through ten  the borrower has the option of selecting an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread  or a fixed rate that is tied to the five year cmt plus a spread 
the latter option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
while the spread above the five year cmt in the first five years had long been basis points  spreads began to move toward more historical levels in the fourth quarter of  as adverse conditions in the capital markets and liquidity pressures forced many lenders from the market  and the credit cycle began its downward turn 
reflecting our ability to capitalize on this significant change in market conditions  the multi family loans we produced in the fourth quarter of featured an average spread of basis points above the average five year cmt 
as improvements are made to the collateral property  the property owner is permitted  in accordance with rent regulations  to increase the amount of rent to be paid by the tenant  thus creating more cash flows to borrow against 
as the rent roll increases  the property owner typically opts to refinance the loan  even in a rising interest rate environment 
this cycle has repeated itself over the course of many decades  with property values increasing  and borrowers typically refinancing before the loan reaches its sixth year 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at december  multi family loans that refinance within the first five years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then current loan balance 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family loans is the consistent quality of these assets we have not had a loss of principal on a multi family loan in our niche for years 
although multi family loans are generally considered to involve a greater degree of credit risk as compared to other types of credits  we believe that the multi family loans we produce involve a more modest degree of risk 
the multi family loans we produce are typically collateralized by rent regulated buildings which tend to be stable and fully occupied 
because the buildings securing the loans are generally well maintained  and the rents are typically below market  occupancy levels remain more or less constant  even during times of economic adversity 
thus  while losses on loans may increase for many lenders in the current credit cycle  we believe that the nature of our multi family lending niche  together with our underwriting standards  should serve to reduce our exposure to credit risk 
the approval process for multi family loans is also highly efficient  typically taking a period of four to six weeks 
our success in this lending niche also reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of lending based on the cash flows produced by the buildings collateralizing these loans 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is significantly expedited and the related expenses substantially reduced 
commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans totaled billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the balance recorded at december  in addition to loans that were added in our three acquisitions  the increase reflects million of originated and purchased loans 
at december   of our commercial real estate loans were secured by properties in new york city  with properties in new jersey and on long island accounting for and  respectively 
the commercial real estate loans we produce are secured by income producing properties such as office buildings  retail centers  and multi tenanted light industrial buildings 

table of contents the pricing of our commercial real estate loans is structured along the same lines as our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally tied to the five year cmt  plus a spread 
for years six through ten  the borrower generally has the option of selecting an annually adjustable rate that is based on the prime rate of interest  or a fixed rate that is based on the five year cmt  each plus a spread 
the latter option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate featured in the initial five year term 
prepayment penalties also apply  with five percentage points of the then current balance generally being charged on loans that refinance in the first year  scaling down to one percentage point of the then current balance on loans that refinance in year five 
our commercial real estate loans also tend to refinance within five years of origination  and the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate commercial real estate loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and generally requires a debt service coverage ratio of at least  and a loan to value ratio that typically does not exceed 
in addition  the origination of commercial real estate loans generally requires a security interest in the personal property and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
at december   the average commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of million and the portfolio had an average loan to value ratio of 
construction loans construction loans totaled billion at december   million higher than the balance recorded at year end the decision to limit the portfolio s growth was strategic in nature 
as the housing market began to decline in the second half of  we chose to reduce our production of construction loans 
as a result  originations totaled million in and million in  representing and  respectively  of total loans produced 
at december   of the loans in the portfolio were for construction in new york city  with manhattan accounting for more than a third of the city s share 
long island accounted for of our construction loans  with other parts of new york state and new jersey accounting for  combined 
little construction lending is done outside our immediate market and  even then  to borrowers we have lent to successfully within our marketplace 
the construction loans we produce are primarily for land acquisition  development  and construction of multi family and residential tract projects  and  to a lesser extent  for the construction of owner occupied one to four family homes and commercial properties 
such loans are typically originated for terms of to months  and feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime  and a floor 
they also generate origination fees that are recorded as interest income and amortized over the life of the loan 
our construction loans have had a strong credit history  with no losses recorded for more than ten years 
because construction loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk  borrowers are required to provide a personal guarantee of repayment and completion during construction 
the risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value upon completion of construction  as compared to the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and upon the estimated time to sell or lease such properties 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  or the length of time to sell or lease it is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
when applicable  it is our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of our loan 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 
we typically require pre leasing for loans on commercial properties 

table of contents one to four family loans one to four family loans represented million  or  of total loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  representing  at december  the increase was largely driven by our acquisitions  as it is our practice to originate one to four family loans through a third party conduit and to sell the loans to the conduit or its affiliates  shortly after they close  without recourse and servicing released 
in connection with this practice  which was adopted on december   we participate in a private label program for the origination of one to four family loans with a nationally recognized third party mortgage originator the conduit  based on defined underwriting criteria 
the loans are marketed through our branch network and our web site  and are intended to serve our existing customers and attract new ones  as well 
in addition  dedicated loan representatives are available through the conduit program to meet with our customers and assist them with the application process 
we fund the loans directly and have the option of retaining the loans for portfolio or delivering the loans to the conduit 
each loan we originate through the conduit program generates income that is recorded as other non interest income in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
in  we originated one to four family and home equity loans totaling million  as compared to million in the prior year 
we have no sub prime or alt a loans in our loan portfolio 
in addition to ensuring that our customers are provided with an extensive range of one to four family products  the conduit arrangement supports two of our primary objectives managing our exposure to interest rate risk and maintaining our efficiency 
other loans other loans represented of total loans at december   as compared to at december  reflecting loans added in our three acquisitions and twelve month originations of billion  other loans rose to million at december  from million at the year earlier date 
c i loans represented million and million of the respective year end totals  and accounted for billion and million of loans originated in the respective years 
c i loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers  and include term loans  demand loans  revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  and loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration 
a broad range of commercial loans  both collateralized and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  business expansion  the purchase of machinery and equipment  and other general corporate needs 
the purpose of the loan is considered in determining its tenor and structure  and pricing is tied to the prime rate of interest or other market indices plus an applicable spread 
in addition  we seek to establish full scale banking relationships with our c i customers 
as a result  many of our borrowers have provided us with deposits  and many are taking advantage of our cash management  investment  and trade finance services 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our merger partners prior to their joining the company 
lending authority the loans we originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage and real estate committee of the board of directors of the community bank the mortgage committee  the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors as a whole 
in addition to the loans that we ourselves have originated  the portfolio includes loans that have been acquired in our various business combinations that we have opted to retain 

table of contents in accordance with the banks policies  all loans of million or more must be reported to the respective boards of directors 
in  of such loans were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in the prior year  of such loans were originated by the banks with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in addition  we place a limit on the amount of loans that may be made to one borrower 
at december   the largest concentration of loans to one borrower consisted of a million financing package provided by the community bank to riverbay corporation co op city  a residential community with  units in the bronx  new york  which was created under new york state s mitchell lama housing program in the late s to provide affordable housing for middle income residents of the state 
the financing package was originated on september  and  at december   consisted of a multi family loan of million and construction advances of million 
an additional million of construction funds were unadvanced at year end

the company had no commitments to originate one to four family loans at december  in addition to our commitments to originate loans  we had commitments to issue financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit of million  million  and million  respectively  at december  the commitments featured terms ranging from one to three years 
financial stand by letters of 
table of contents credit obligate us to guarantee payment of a specific financial obligation on behalf of certain borrowers  while performance stand by letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under certain non financial contractual obligations 
commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer 
although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions  the majority are used to settle payments in international trade 
typically  such letters of credit require presentation of documents which describe the commercial transaction  and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
please see contractual obligations and off balance sheet commitments later in this report for a further discussion of financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit 
asset quality in  our performance continued to be distinguished by the quality of our assets  with non performing assets representing of total assets at december   an improvement from of total assets at december  non performing assets rose modestly during the year  from million to million  as a  increase in non performing loans was tempered by a  reduction in other real estate owned 
non performing loans rose from million at year end to million at year end  primarily reflecting million of synergy loans that were non performing at the current year end 
each of the respective balances was equivalent to of total loans 
included in non performing loans at december  were non accrual mortgage loans of million and non accrual other loans of million  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
when necessary  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to borrowers who are delinquent in paying their loans 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned  and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property at that time 
at december   other real estate owned consisted of five properties totaling  as compared to five properties totaling million at december  a portion of other real estate owned is titled in the name of a wholly owned bank subsidiary 
it is our policy to require an appraisal of such properties shortly before foreclosure and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the condition of the property 
we are currently in the process of marketing the properties acquired by foreclosure at prices that exceed their respective carrying values  and therefore do not expect to incur a loss when such properties are sold 
charge offs rose from  in to  in  and each represented of average loans in the respective years 
consistent with our experience in the preceding nine quarters  the loans we charged off in consisted of consumer and unsecured credits that had been added in our business combinations 
while the quality of the loan portfolio is partly due to the absence of significant weakness in our local economy and real estate market in  it also is indicative of our underwriting standards  and the consistency with which we have adhered to these standards while growing our loan portfolio 
in the case of multi family and commercial real estate loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated to determine the property s economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value being the value more typically used 

table of contents the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
multi family buildings and commercial real estate properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by executive management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on multi family loans originated in excess of million 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on commercial real estate loans in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on collateral properties 
in addition  we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers typically exceeds ten years 
to further manage our credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of  except for commercial real estate loans  which generally require a minimum ratio of 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the average loan to value ratio of such credits at december  was considerably lower  amounting to and  respectively 
exceptions to these loan to value limitations may be made on a case by case basis  and require the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the boards of directors also take part in the construction lending process  as all construction loans require the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the pertinent committee participates in inspections when the loan amount exceeds million 
we believe that the construction loans in our portfolio have been prudently underwritten 
in addition  they are primarily made to well established builders who have worked with us or our merger partners in the past 
we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value of multi family and residential tract projects  however  in the case of home construction loans to individuals  the limit is 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value of the property 
credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
c i loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  and are generally collateralized by various business assets  including  but not limited to  inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loans may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the business results 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for c i loans 
our loan portfolio has been deliberately structured to manage our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and commercial real estate loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to five years of origination  and the duration of construction loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
all three types of mortgage loans have had a solid performance record  with no losses on principal recorded for years in the case of our multi family credits and more than ten years in the case of commercial real estate and construction loans 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by rent regulated buildings which  historically  have tended to maintain a high level of occupancy  even in a declining economy 
the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories  with late charges assessed  and notices mailed to the borrower  at specified dates 
we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action 

table of contents while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  the absence of delinquencies or losses cannot be guaranteed 
in addition to a change in personal circumstances  the ability of a borrower to fulfill his or her obligations may be impacted by a downturn in the credit cycle 
although the quality of our loan portfolio continued to be strong in the late s and early s  when the last major cycle turn resulted in significant industry losses  we cannot guarantee that our portfolio will remain unaffected by the current credit cycle turn 
at december   our loan loss allowance totaled million  and was equivalent to of non performing loans and of total loans at that date 
at the prior year end  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  and was equivalent to and of non performing loans and total loans  respectively 
the year over year increase was attributable to our acquisitions which added million to the loan loss allowance during the year 
while the allowance for loan losses may be increased through a provision for loan losses that is charged to operations  no provisions were made in or the manner in which the allowance for loan losses is established  and the assumptions made in that process  are considered critical to our financial condition and results 
such assumptions are based on judgments that are difficult  complex  and subjective regarding various matters of inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
based upon all relevant and presently available information  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the following table presents information regarding our consolidated allowance for loan losses and non performing assets at each year end in the five years ended december  asset quality analysis at december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year allowance acquired in business combinations charge offs balance at end of year non performing assets non accrual mortgage loans other non accrual loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance for loan losses to total loans we had no troubled debt restructurings  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  at any of the dates presented in the preceding table 

table of contents the following table sets forth the allocation of the consolidated allowance for loan losses at each year end in the five years ended december  summary of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans mortgage loans multi family commercial real estate construction family other loans total loans the preceding allocation is based upon an estimate of various factors  as discussed in critical accounting policies earlier in this report  and a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future 
in addition  it should be noted that the portion of the loan loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category  since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio 

table of contents securities securities represented billion  or  of total assets at december   as compared to billion  or  of total assets  at december  while the current year end balance was increased by our three business combinations and by purchases totaling billion  the growth of the portfolio was largely offset by securities sales of billion and repayments of million over the course of the year 
the cash flows generated through the sale of securities were primarily used to purchase higher yielding government sponsored enterprise gse obligations defined as gse certificates  gse collateralized mortgage obligations  and gse debentures  and also were used to reduce our higher cost funds 
there are no subprime or alt a backed issues in our securities portfolio 
the investment policies of the company and the banks are established by the respective boards of directors and implemented by their respective investment committees  in concert with the respective asset and liability management committees 
the investment committees generally meet quarterly or on an as needed basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions 
in addition  the securities portfolios are reviewed monthly by the boards of directors as a whole 
furthermore  the policies guiding the company s and the banks investments are reviewed at least annually by the respective investment committees  as well as by the respective boards 
while the policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets  neither the company nor the banks currently maintain a trading portfolio 
the investment policies of the company and the banks permit investments in mortgage related securities  ie  securities issued and backed by such gses as fannie mae fnma and freddie mac fhlmc  and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and other securities  consisting of gse debentures  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  capital trust notes  and corporate equities 
depending on management s intent at the time of purchase  securities are classified as available for sale or as held to maturity 
while available for sale securities are intended to generate earnings  they also represent a significant source of cash flows and liquidity for future loan production  the reduction of higher cost funding  and general operating activities 
held to maturity securities also generate cash flows and serve as a source of earnings 
our investment portfolio is primarily concentrated in gse cmos and gse debentures 
to a much lesser extent  our portfolio is also comprised of triple a rated private label cmos  corporate bonds  trust preferred securities  corporate equities  and municipal obligations 
our general investment strategy is to purchase liquid investments with various maturities to ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stays within policy requirements 
substantially all of our securities have readily determinable market prices that are derived from third party pricing services 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we consider the duration and severity of the unrealized loss  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers  and our intent and ability to hold the investments to allow for a recovery in market value in a reasonable period of time 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized in current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
based upon our analysis of the investment portfolio at december   we determined that there was no decline in market value deemed to be other than temporary 
securities expected to be held for an indefinite period of time are classified as available for sale 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and our asset and liability management strategy 
available for sale securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   and were down million from the balance recorded at december  included in the respective year end amounts were mortgage related securities of million and billion  and other securities of million and million  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the company sold billion of available for sale securities at a pre tax loss of million 
the securities had been written down in the second quarter of  generating an other than temporary impairment loss on securities of million that was recorded in non interest income 
reflecting the sale of these securities  the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale equaled million at december   a 
table of contents significant reduction from million at december  the respective after tax losses were recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated statements of condition at december  and the sale of these securities also resulted in an increase in the estimated weighted average life of the available for sale securities portfolio  to years at december  from years at december  held to maturity securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   signifying a year over year increase of billion  or 
mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the year end and totals  with other securities representing the remaining billion and billion  respectively 
included in the respective year end amounts were gse obligations of billion and billion  capital trust notes of million and million  and corporate bonds of million and million 
the estimated weighted average lives of the held to maturity securities portfolio were years and years at the corresponding dates 
bank owned life insurance boli at december   the company had a million investment in boli  as compared to million at december  in addition to an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies  the million increase reflects million of boli that was acquired in the pennfed transaction and million of boli that was acquired in the transaction with synergy 
boli is reported at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition  and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in non interest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
