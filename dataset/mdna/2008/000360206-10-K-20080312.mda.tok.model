critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment  future actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the company reevaluates its estimates and assumptions on a monthly basis 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of estimation or assumption allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends in collections and write offs  current customer status  the age of the receivable  economic conditions and other information 
aged receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if the reserve is adequate and adjusted accordingly at that time

the warranty period is for parts only  the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment  compressors if applicable  an additional four years  on gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  years  and on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable  years 
warranty expense is estimated based on the company s warranty period  historical warranty trends and associated costs  and any known identifiable warranty issue 
warranty charges associated with heat exchanges do not occur frequently 
due to the absence of warranty history on new products  an additional provision may be made for such products 
the company s estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience 
should actual claim rates differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required
