item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following presents an analysis of the results and financial condition of our continuing operations 
except where indicated otherwise  the results of discontinued operations are excluded from this discussion 
we are a national  diversified  restaurant  hospitality and entertainment company principally engaged in the ownership and operation of full service  casual dining restaurants 
as of december   we operated such restaurants  as well as several limited menu restaurants and other properties as described in item business  including the golden nugget hotels and casinos golden nugget in las vegas and laughlin  nevada 
we are in the business of operating restaurants and other hospitality and entertainment activities 
on january  our board of directors received a letter from tilman j 
fertitta  chairman  president and ceo  proposing to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for per share in cash  representing a premium over the closing price of our common stock on january  according to the proposal letter  mr 
fertitta is confident that he can obtain all the required financing to fund the transaction given that he will be contributing all of his approximately equity ownership of the company  as well as substantial additional cash equity 
our board of directors has established a special negotiating committee of independent directors to review the proposal  as well as any alternative proposals that may be received 
there can be no assurance that any agreement on financial or other terms satisfactory to the special negotiating committee will be reached 
approximately million in senior exchange notes new notes allow the note holders to redeem the new notes at of face value from february  to december  as a result of the risk that our 
table of contents note holders will exercise their option to redeem the senior notes  we are pursuing alternative long term financing 
despite the turmoil in the credit markets  we believe and have received indications from several financial sources that we will be successful in obtaining such financing due to our long history of performance  our strong diversified brands and our geographic diversification 
however  we also believe that the new financing will carry substantially higher interest rates and more restrictive terms than our current agreements and will reduce our capital available for growth and the terms may restrict our availability to pursue acquisitions in the near term 
accordingly  we have reduced our planned new unit growth for and until new financing is obtained 
notwithstanding the foregoing  due to the volatility in the credit markets  it is possible we will not be able to refinance the current loans 
during  as part of a strategic review of our operations  we initiated a plan to divest certain restaurants  including joe s crab shack units 
during  several additional locations were added to our disposal plan 
the results of operations for all units included in the disposal plan have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of income  balance sheets and segment information for all periods presented 
on november   we completed the sale of joe s crab shack restaurants for approximately million  including the assumption of certain working capital liabilities 
in connection with the sale  we recorded pre tax impairment charges and other losses totaling million 
we recorded additional pre tax impairment charges totaling million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  to write down carrying values of assets pertaining to the remaining stores included in our disposal plan 
we expect to sell the land and improvements belonging to these remaining restaurants  or abandon those locations  within the next months 
in connection with our strategic review  we also identified certain restaurants that we believe are suitable for conversion into other landry s concepts 
as a result of this review  we took a charge of million during to impair certain assets relating to these conversion units to reflect our best estimates of their fair market value 
the results of operations for these restaurants are included in continuing operations 
on september   landry s gaming  inc  an unrestricted subsidiary  purchased the golden nugget hotels and casinos in downtown las vegas and laughlin  nevada gn for million in cash  the assumption of million of senior secured notes due and the assumption of approximately million under an existing senior revolving credit facility and the further assumption of certain working capital including million in cash 
the golden nugget las vegas occupies approximately eight acres in downtown las vegas with approximately  square feet of gaming area 
the property also features three towers containing  rooms  the largest number of guestrooms in downtown las vegas 
the golden nugget laughlin is located on acres on the colorado river with  square feet of gaming space and rooms 
the results of operations for these properties are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the specialty growth division is primarily engaged in operating complementary entertainment and hospitality activities  such as miscellaneous beverage carts and various kiosks  amusement rides and games and some associated limited hotel properties  generally at locations in conjunction with our core restaurant operations 
the total assets  revenues  and operating profits of these complementary specialty business activities are considered not material to the overall business and below the threshold of a separate reportable business segment under sfas no 
we are in the business of operating restaurants  two casinos and the above mentioned complementary activities 
we do not engage in real estate operations other than those associated with the ownership and operation of our business 
we own a fee interest own the land and building in a number of properties underlying our businesses  but do not engage in real estate sales or real estate management in any significant fashion or format 
the chief executive officer  who is responsible for our operations  reviews and evaluates both 
table of contents core and non core business activities and results  and determines financial and management resource allocations and investments for all business activities 
the restaurant and gaming industries are intensely competitive and affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants or casinos may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing operations 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from other casinos in the markets in which we operate and from other mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy should we be successful in obtaining permanent financing to replace our senior notes

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  from  to  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase for was primarily due to the renovation of the golden nugget and the addition of new restaurants and equipment 
restaurant pre opening expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
pre opening expenses fluctuate based on both the number and type of openings completed each period 
the increase in net interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and increased borrowings  as well as an million charge for deferred loan costs previously being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
the senior notes were exchanged for senior notes as a result of a settlement with the note holders 
other income  net for was  and consisted primarily of gains on the disposition of property in biloxi  mississippi and investments held for sale  as well as a million gain realized on the sale of a single restaurant location 
according to the terms of the sale  we will pay the buyer approximately million over the next months in return for continuing to operate the restaurant 
these gains were offset by expenses associated with exchanging the senior notes for senior notes  non cash charges related to interest rate swaps not considered hedges and call premiums and expenses associated with refinancing the golden nugget debt 
other income for primarily related to the gain on the sale of a restaurant property and insurance proceeds

table of contents other operating expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year  principally as a result of increased revenues 
such expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  as a primary result of the acquisition of the golden nugget since gaming revenues are generally derived from higher labor and other operating expenses and lower cost of revenues than restaurant and hospitality revenues

depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase for was primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to the addition of new restaurants and equipment and the acquisition of the golden nugget 
as part of our strategic review of operations in  we identified certain joe s restaurants that we believe are suitable for conversion into other landry s concepts 
as a result of this review  we took a charge of million to impair certain assets relating to these conversion units to reflect our best estimates of their fair market value 
assets that were impaired are primarily leasehold improvements and to a lesser extent equipment 
we did not take any impairment charges in restaurant pre opening expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the increase resulted from our opening a greater number of larger scale restaurants during as compared to units opened in the increase in net interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher borrowings  as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate 
other income  net for was  and consisted primarily of gains recognized on the sale of a restaurant property and insurance proceeds 
provision for income taxes decreased by  to  in the year ended december  our effective tax rate for was compared to in liquidity and capital resources as a result of the settlement described below and the associated risk that our note holders will exercise their option to redeem the approximately million in senior notes  we are pursuing alternative long term financing 
despite the turmoil in the credit markets  we believe and have received indications from several financial sources that we will be successful in obtaining such financing due to our long history of performance  our strong diversified brands and our geographic diversification 
however  we also believe that the new financing will carry substantially higher interest rates and more restrictive terms than our current agreements 
moreover  as the debt market is very volatile at this time  it is possible we will not be able to refinance the current loans 
higher interest rates would reduce our capital available for growth and the terms may restrict our availability to pursue acquisitions in the near term 
accordingly  we have reduced our planned new unit growth for and until new financing is obtained 
on july   we were notified by the trustee under the indenture covering our million senior notes the notes  that as a result of not filing with the sec and delivering to the trustee our form k for the year ended december  within the time frame set forth in the rules and regulations of the 
table of contents sec  the trustee  upon direction of a majority of the note holders  declared the unpaid principal and interest on the notes due and payable immediately 
on august  we entered into a stipulation of settlement with us bank  national association  indenture trustee under our million senior notes and certain note holders whereby the previous acceleration of the notes was rescinded and annulled 
in connection with the settlement  we agreed to commence an exchange offering on or before october  to exchange the notes for senior exchange notes the new notes with an interest rate of  an option for the company to redeem the new notes at above par from october  to february  and an option for the note holders to redeem the new notes at above par from february  to december   both options requiring at least but not more than days notice 
the exchange offer was completed on october  with all but million of the notes being exchanged 
we also agreed to pay certain fees and costs and dismissed the pending litigation we had previously instituted against the indenture trustee and certain note holders 
as a result of the exchange  we recorded charges during the third quarter of of million  included in interest expense  for deferred loan costs previously being amortized over the term of the notes and million  included in other income expense  related to the payment of a consent fee 
in connection with issuing the new notes  we amended our existing bank credit facility to provide for an accelerated maturity should the new notes be redeemed by the note holders  revised certain financial covenants to reflect the impact of the exchange offer and redeemed our outstanding term loan balance 
in june  our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary  golden nugget  inc the golden nugget  completed a new million credit facility consisting of a million first lien term loan  a million revolving credit facility  and a million second lien term loan 
the million first lien term loan includes a million delayed draw component to finance the expansion at the golden nugget hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada 
the revolving credit facility expires on june  and the first lien term loan matures on june  both the first lien term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at libor or the bank s base rate  plus a financing spread  and  respectively  at december  in addition  the credit facility requires a commitment fee on the unfunded portion for both the million revolving credit facility and the million delayed draw component of the first lien term loan 
the second lien term loan matures on december  and bears interest at libor or the bank s base rate  plus a financing spread  and  respectively  at december  the financing spreads and commitment fees for the revolving credit facility increase or decrease depending on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the first lien term loan requires one percent of the outstanding principal balance due annually to be paid in equal quarterly installments commencing on september  with the balance due on maturity 
principal of the second lien term loan is due at maturity 
the golden nugget s subsidiaries have granted liens on substantially all real property and personal property as collateral under the credit facility and are guarantors of the credit facility 
the proceeds from the credit facility were used to repay all of the golden nugget s outstanding debt  including its senior secured notes due december  plus the outstanding balance of approximately million on its former million revolving credit facility 
in addition  the proceeds were used to pay a dividend to one of our unrestricted subsidiaries of million  associated tender premiums of approximately million due to the early redemption of the senior secured notes due december  plus accrued interest and related transaction fees and expenses 
our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants including minimum ebitda  fixed charge and financial leverage ratios  limitations on capital expenditures  and other restricted payments as defined in the agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
as of december   our average interest rate on floating rate debt was  we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding  and our available borrowing capacity was million 
working capital  excluding discontinued operations  decreased from a deficit of million as of december  to a deficit of million as of december  primarily due to the change in the classification of borrowings under the bank credit facility to current 
cash flow to fund future operations  new 
table of contents restaurant development  stock repurchases  and acquisitions will be generated from operations  available capacity under our credit facilities and additional financing  if appropriate 
from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  gaming  entertainment  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  subject to obtaining long term financing as noted above 
since april  we have paid an annual per common share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
we increased the annual dividend to per common share in april we paid dividends totaling million during the year ended december  in  we incurred million for capital expenditures including million on the renovation and expansion of the golden nugget hotel and casino in downtown las vegas  nevada  and million on the construction of a new t rex and yak yeti s restaurant at two disney properties 
in  we expect to incur approximately million  including completion of the t rex at disney and beginning the new tower at the golden nugget las vegas 
treasury stock repurchases totaled million for the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital  the bank credit facility and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
our obligations include off balance sheet arrangements whereby the liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and standby letters of credit are not fully reflected in our balance sheets 
contractual obligations total long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations liability for uncertain tax positions other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total these liabilities appear in total only as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such liabilities 

table of contents in connection with certain of our discontinued operations  we remain the guarantor or assignor of a number of leased locations 
in the event of future defaults under any of such leased locations we may be responsible for significant damages to existing landlords which may materially affect our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and will continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually using estimates of future operating results 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair values  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 
we operate approximately properties and periodically we expect to experience unanticipated individual unit deterioration in revenues and profitability  on a short term and occasionally longer term basis 
when such events occur and we determine that the associated assets are impaired  we will record an asset impairment expense in the quarter such determination is made 
due to our average restaurant net investment cost  such amounts could be significant when and if they occur 
however  such asset impairment expense does not affect our financial liquidity  and is usually excluded from many valuation model calculations 
we maintain a large deductible insurance policy related to property  general liability and workers compensation coverage 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit our per occurrence cash outlay 
accrued expenses and other liabilities include estimated costs to settle unpaid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims using actuarial methodologies 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
we regularly assess the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets based on forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented and adjust the related valuation allowance if necessary 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
in connection with the adoption of fin  we recognized an increase of approximately million to our tax reserves for uncertain positions  which was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings as of january  as of january   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including million of interest and penalties  which represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably impact our effective income tax rate in future periods 

table of contents our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we have substantially concluded all federal  state and local income tax matters for years through we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service for our consolidated federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
under this transition method  we will record compensation expense for all stock option awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted stock option awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the amount of compensation cost that is recognized is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas r  the recognition of unearned compensation  a contra equity account representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock compensation expense  is no longer required 
therefore  in the first quarter of the unearned compensation amount that was included in our december  consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million was reduced to zero with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value 
results for prior periods have not been restated upon adoption of sfas r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets and costs to settle unpaid claims 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  there is a one year deferral of the implementation of sfas for other non financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which expands the use of the acquisition method of accounting used in business combinations to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses or assets 
this statement replaces sfas no 
by requiring measurement at the acquisition date of the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest 
additionally  sfas r requires that acquisition related costs  including restructuring costs  be recognized as expense separately from the acquisition 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first fiscal period beginning on or after december  the implementation of this guidance will affect our results of operations and financial position after its effective date only to the extent we complete business combinations and therefore the impact can not be determined at this time 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes the accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests and applies prospectively to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas beginning january  and are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in commodity costs  labor costs  including expected future increases in federal and state minimum wages  energy costs  and land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including risks related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings at an average interest rate of 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
in connection with the senior notes due  we entered into two interest swap agreements with the objective of managing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense 
the agreements were effective december and march  for an aggregate notional amount of million 
we settled these swap agreements in december for a pre tax cash gain of approximately million 
consistent with our policy to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  and in conformity with the requirements of the first and second lien facilities  we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts covering all of the first and second lien borrowings of the golden nugget 
the hedges are designed to convert the lien facilities floating interest rates to fixed interest rates at between and  plus the applicable margin 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt and other obligations outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts
