overview 
we are engaged primarily in the operation of multifamily residential units that we own 
we also provide asset and property management services to third party owners of multifamily residential units for which we are paid fees 
our primary source of cash and revenue from operations is rents from the leasing of owned apartment units 
approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated from the leasing of these owned units for the year ended december   and approximately of the property revenue generated by these owned properties was related to the market rate properties 
during the third quarter of  we announced our plan to exit the affordable housing business 
as of december   we have reduced our management of properties to only three  one of which is an affordable housing property 
the owned affordable housing properties and the joint venture affordable housing property are all under contracts for sale 
we consider property noi to be an important indicator of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties  which has the largest impact of all of our sources of income and expense on our financial condition and operating results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for additional information regarding property noi and total noi  in addition to a reconciliation of total noi to consolidated net income in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our four reportable segments are based upon types of property and services and consist of our market rate properties of total property revenue  properties we acquired or developed within the prior year and properties that have been sold or are classified as held for sale  which segment is referred to as acquisition disposition  our affordable housing properties and management and service operations 
our same community market rate portfolio consists of properties containing  units and accounted for of total property revenue in and of our property noi 
during our net collected rents for the market rate portfolio increased 
this growth was due to an increase of for our midwest portfolio and for our mid atlantic southeast portfolio 
the growth rate in our midwest portfolio is similar to the growth we recognized in  while the growth rate for our mid atlantic southeast portfolio was much less than the growth rate we recognized in we anticipate that for the net collected rents for the same community market rate portfolio will grow at approximately to 
in  we intend to continue with our strategy of reducing our midwest presence by selling non core properties 
we will also continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in higher growth markets that we have identified 
however  recent limited transactional activity in these markets may hinder our ability to find suitable replacement properties that satisfy our investment criteria 
we may also consider selling assets in any market  including the mid atlantic and southeast markets  where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide a significantly greater return on equity and an increase in cash flow 
we are also focused on reducing overall interest rate charges on our borrowings which  at december   had a weighted average rate of 
we plan to accomplish this goal by using a portion of any sale proceeds to pay off debt or refinance existing debt with new debt at lower interest rates 
in order to increase property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
in  we updated all of our property websites to offer prospective tenants virtual property tours  and the ability to check availability and reserve an apartment unit online 
in  we plan to offer online leasing and a resident portal feature that gives residents the ability to pay rent  sign up for utilities  request maintenance services and create their own personal web home page 
also in  we introduced a product standardization initiative designed to reduce costs in certain areas and in  we plan to expand this program into other areas to provide additional savings 
expectations portfolio performance we expect to increase our market rate property noi by approximately to in  driven by property revenue increases of to 
however  these expectations may be adversely impacted if the economy suffers a broad and prolonged recessionary period 
property acquisitions and sales we plan to acquire approximately million of properties  while disposing of approximately million of properties 
included in these dispositions are the affordable housing properties  which contributed income of approximately per common share from property operations and per common share relating to the settlement of a lawsuit in pertaining to the collection of past due rents 
these properties are expected to be disposed of during the first half of defeasance and other prepayment costs we expect to incur approximately million in costs to defease prepay or refinance debt during federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our service companies are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs s 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for all of our service companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities fixed assets property acquisitions  net property disposition proceeds  net recurring and non recurring capital expenditures debt decrease increase in mortgage notes increase decrease in revolver or line of credit borrowings issuance of unsecured trust preferred securities cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid purchase of preferred and or treasury shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the revolver and proceeds from property sales 
the increase in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in property revenues provided mainly by the two properties acquired in june and a reduction in defeasance and other prepayment costs incurred in compared to this increase in cash flow was partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable resulting from the timing of cash payments 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to the payment of million of defeasance and other prepayment costs  which were funded by property sales and secured borrowings 
excluding these costs  cash flow from operations would have increased million primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable resulting from the timing of cash payments 
during  cash on hand  funds received from the sale of properties and funds borrowed on the revolver were primarily used to acquire two operating properties and repurchase our common and preferred shares pursuant to our stock repurchase plan 
revolving credit facility 
in april  we obtained a million unsecured revolving credit facility which is being used for the refinancing of existing debt  the acquisition of properties and general corporate purposes 
the revolver provides for  without limitation  a maximum debt limitation and other financial covenants related to net worth  leverage  fixed charge coverage  unencumbered interest coverage  and dividend payments 
we terminated our million and million secured lines of credit simultaneously with obtaining the revolver 
at december   there were borrowings of million outstanding on the revolver 
we are currently in negotiation with our lenders to increase this credit facility 
shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to a possible offering  from time to time  of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
the remaining availability under the shelf registration at december   is million 
however  it is unlikely that we could issue debt securities under this shelf registration without first making major modifications to the shelf registration debt covenants 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as the revolver  secured and unsecured borrowings  and property sales proceeds are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for paying down debt  acquiring properties or buying back our shares are expected to be provided primarily by property sale proceeds  refinancings and from the revolver

at december   we had unencumbered properties  of which are affordable housing properties 
these properties had net income of million for the year ended december   and a net book value of million at december  twelve of these unencumbered properties are scheduled for disposition during the first half of we own six of the affordable housing unencumbered properties pursuant to ground lease agreements which  upon expiration of the applicable lease  require reversion of the land and building to the ground lessor 
these ground leases expire at various dates from to total revenue derived from these properties was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
furthermore  at the end of the term of each ground lease  any remaining replacement reserves applicable to four of those properties revert to the ground lessor 
such replacement reserves included in restricted cash were  and  at december  and  respectively 
with respect to such leases  we paid ground rent of  for each the years ended december   and one of the unencumbered properties is subject to a right of reverter 
this provision requires that the land and real estate assets revert at expiration back to the original grantor from whom we acquired this property or its successors and assignees  which is in september the net book value of this property was  at december  this property generated revenue of million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and net income of   and  for   and respectively 
we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under all noncancellable operating leases in which we are the lessee  principally for ground leases  are included in the previous table of contractual obligations 
off balance sheet investments and financing commitments 
we have an investment in a joint venture that owns an affordable housing property 
the operation of this property is similar to the operations of our wholly owned portfolio 
joint venture investments enable us to exercise influence over the operations of such properties and share in their profits  while earning additional fee income 
we account for our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence  but do not control this entity and are not required to consolidate it in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities or under eitf  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights 
this investment was initially recorded at cost as investment in joint ventures and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
this joint venture property had negative cash flow during and is expected to have negative cash flow during as a result of operating expenses exceeding tenant rents and the housing assistance payments from hud 
the joint venture partnership that owns this property has entered into a contract to sell it 
our proportionate share of the debt on this property at december   was million 
for summarized financial information for this joint venture  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
operating partnership 
as provided in the aerc hp investors limited partnership agreement downreit partnership  we  as general partner  have guaranteed the obligation of the downreit partnership to redeem op units held by the limited partners 
the downreit partnership was formed in under the terms of the downreit partnership agreement  the downreit partnership is obligated to redeem op units for our common shares or cash  at our discretion  at a price per op unit equal to the day trailing price of our common shares for the immediate day period preceding a limited partner s redemption notice 
during  we redeemed op units 
as of december   there were  op units remaining having a carrying value of million  and  of the original  op units had been redeemed 
these transactions had the effect of increasing our interest in the downreit partnership from to 
for additional information regarding the op units  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
acquisitions and development 
on june   we acquired our joint venture partner s interest in idlewylde apartments  an unit market rate property located in atlanta  georgia 
we previously owned a interest in this partnership and had accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
we paid our partner million in cash and assumed responsibility for the entire mortgage debt encumbering the property 
commencing june   the results of operations  financial condition including the existing million non recourse mortgage loan  and cash flows of this property are included in our consolidated financial statements 
on june   we acquired a unit market rate property located in norfolk  virginia for a purchase price of million 
the purchase was funded primarily by proceeds from the disposition of a market rate property  which we sold on may   and with borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
on may   we acquired the land on which one of our affordable housing properties is located for a purchase price of  we had been leasing this land pursuant to a ground lease which was scheduled to mature in we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in higher growth markets that we previously identified 
any future property acquisitions or developments would be financed with the most appropriate sources of capital  which may include the assumption of mortgage indebtedness  bank and other institutional borrowings  the exchange of properties  undistributed earnings  secured or unsecured debt financings  or the issuance of shares or units exchangeable into common shares 
dispositions 
during  we sold three market rate properties for net cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of one property  fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the operating results of these properties  along with the gains of million that we recognized  are included in income from discontinued operations 
during  we sold eight properties seven market rate properties and one affordable housing property for net cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to defease prepay debt  repurchase million of our common shares and partially fund capital expenditures 
the operating results of these properties  along with the gains of million that we recognized  are included in income from discontinued operations 
management and service operations 
revenues from our management and service operations will be significantly reduced in as a result of our exit from the affordable housing business 
at the end of  the management contracts related to affordable housing properties were terminated 
as of december   we managed one affordable housing property for an affiliated third party  two market rate properties for third party owners  and the joint venture affordable housing property 
additionally  we asset managed one residential property and one commercial property 
we expect revenues generated by third party management operations to decrease by million due to our decision to exit this business 
net income received from this business in was approximately  and during we expect to offset this loss of net income with cost savings that we have identified 
results of operations for compared with and compared with in the following discussion of the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and the year ended december  to the year ended december   market rate properties refers to the same community market rate property portfolio 
market rate properties represent wholly owned properties

affordable housing properties represent properties 
during the to comparison period  operating income increased million primarily as a result of increased property revenue

during the to comparison period  operating income increased million primarily as a result of increased property revenue

property revenue is impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels 
we measure these factors using indicators such as physical occupancy number of units occupied divided by total number of units at the end of the period and average monthly net collected rent per unit gross potential rents less vacancies and concessions divided by total number of units 
this information is presented in the following table for the years ended december   and physical occupancy for the year ended december  market rate properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total market rate affordable housing acquisition properties n a n a average monthly net collected rent per unit for the year ended december  market rate properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total market rate affordable housing acquisition properties n a n a property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of million contributed by two properties acquired in and an increase of million in our market rate properties 
revenue increases in our market rate properties were primarily due to stable occupancy combined with rental rate increases and an overall reduction in concessions 
property revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in the market rate properties driven by increased occupancy  increased rental rates  fewer concessions  and from increases in revenue related to utility and refuse reimbursement programs that were initiated in late and additionally  two properties acquired in contributed million in rental revenue during property revenue for the affordable housing properties increased million in compared to primarily due to non recurring rental revenue of million received as a result of a settlement of a lawsuit with hud relating to the collection of past due rents at some of our affordable housing properties 
property revenue for the affordable housing properties also increased approximately  in both comparison periods primarily due to hud approved rent increases during and affordable housing revenue is primarily dependent upon the receipt of rental assistance subsidies from hud via monthly housing assistance payments hap payments 
the amount of each monthly hap payment is equal to the rent amount the contract rent stated in the hap contract with hud  less the amount payable by the eligible resident for such month 
in accordance with our plan to exit the affordable housing business  we expect to sell all of our owned affordable housing properties in total revenue from these properties was million  which includes the aforementioned million nonrecurring settlement  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

the eleven wholly owned properties shown in the above table had positive cash flow during and are anticipated to have positive cash flow for the remaining contract terms 
therefore  none of these hap contracts are considered to be loss contracts 
lakeshore village had negative cash flow during as a result of increased operating expenditures related to increased repair and maintenance expenses that exceeded the mark to market modeled expectations 
our request for a budget based increase in monthly hap payments sufficient to support a positive cash flow at this property was denied by hud 
we anticipate that additional cash requirements resulting from the negative cash flow  if any  will be funded by our joint venture partner and us 
the joint venture partnership that owns this property has entered into a contract to sell the property that is not expected to close until late or early contract rents may be adjusted at least annually for some of the properties in accordance with the annual adjustment factor method 
generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
contract renewal request forms must be submitted to hud or its corresponding contract agent not less than days prior to the applicable hap anniversary date in order to renew an existing hap contract 
we understand that the following options are available to us for expiring hap contracts i for properties without mortgages  we may renew at the lesser of current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor ocaf that is set by hud on an annual basis  or a budget based rent increase  ii for properties encumbered by a mortgage  we may renew at the lesser of x current rents plus an ocaf or y comparable market rents  or  iii opt out of the section program 
opting out of the section program requires an additional one year notice to hud or the contract agent and the affected residents 
as previously indicated  we anticipate that these affordable housing properties will be sold during however  if the sale of a property has not been consummated prior to the expiration of a hud contract  we believe that the contract will be renewed or we will enter into another government subsidized or mortgage restructuring program 
the following represents our current expectations concerning those hap contracts that expire in  if the properties are not sold by the time the respective contracts expire shaker park gardens ii 
in april  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with a budget based rent increase of 
hud denied our request 
subsequently  we applied for a increase  as calculated  using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through june  prior to expiration of the current contract  we intend to request a renewal for an additional one year period

in july  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with an increase in rents of  as calculated  using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through november  prior to expiration of the current contract  we intend to request a renewal for an additional one year period 
tallmadge acres 
in november  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with an increase in rents of  as calculated  using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and we expect the contract to be renewed for a one year term effective march  west high apartments 
in july  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with an increase in rents of  as calculated  using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through november  prior to expiration of the current contract  we intend to request a renewal for an additional one year period 
fees  reimbursements and other 
fee revenue and expense reimbursements for the management and service operations will be significantly reduced during as a result of our exit from the affordable housing business 
during the fourth quarter of  management contracts for properties that we managed during were transferred to either the third party owner or to other management companies 
as of january   we manage three properties for third party owners and the joint venture property  and we asset manage one residential and one commercial property 
one of the three managed properties is an affordable housing property and is expected to be sold during or the joint venture property is also expected to be sold during or upon the sale of these properties  we will no longer receive the management fee or reimbursement revenue associated with these properties 
management and advisory fees attributed to properties owned by non affiliated third party owners and advisory clients are earned pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable upon days notice 
property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased when comparing to primarily as a result of increases in personnel expense  real estate tax expense and other operating expenses 
personnel expense increased due to increased salary and benefit costs 
real estate taxes increased due to taxes related to the two properties acquired during and assessed property value and millage rate increases 
other operating expenses increased as a result of increases in the write off of uncollectible tenant rent receivables and associated collection costs 
these increases were partially offset by a credit recorded during resulting from favorable property insurance loss experiences and a renegotiation of the self insured retention amounts 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased when comparing to primarily as a result of increases in real estate tax expense  personnel expense  and repairs and maintenance expenses 
the increase in real estate taxes was due to assessed property value and millage rate increases and a decrease in refunds related to prior year taxes received in the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was due to increases in maintenance project costs  unit preparation costs  landscaping costs  and trash removal costs 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction of million in defeasance prepayment costs that were included in income from continuing operations in interest expense increased in compared to primarily due to million in defeasance prepayment costs that were included in income from continuing operations in interest expense associated with mortgage and revolving debt in income from continuing operations decreased  in compared to and  in compared to primarily as a result of reduced weighted average interest rates 
income from discontinued operations  as discussed below  includes no defeasance prepayments costs or interest expense in  and million in interest expense  of which million is defeasance prepayment costs  in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of the acquisition of two properties in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to primarily due to increases in corporate payroll  bonus  and share based payment costs in these increases were partially offset by a reduction of  in directors compensation in compared to  as a result of valuation adjustments in deferred compensation based on common share units which are valued using the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
general and administrative expenses increased when comparing to primarily due to salary  benefit and share based payment costs and an increase of  in directors compensation  resulting from a valuation adjustment in deferred compensation in additionally  during  we recorded an estimated loss contingency in connection with the out of court settlement reached with montgomery county  maryland 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for further information concerning this settlement 
income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  are the operating results and the gains related to three wholly owned properties that were sold in  eight wholly owned properties that were sold in  and three wholly owned properties that were sold in the operating loss from discontinued operations in was primarily due to costs incurred to defease four loans that were secured by the properties that were sold 
for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
inflation 
it is our belief that the effects of inflation would be minimal on the operational performance of our portfolio as a result of the short term nature of our leases that are typically for terms of one year or less 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and that these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt 
based on this amount of variable rate debt  an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense approximately  on an annual basis 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have  and will continue to manage  interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
we use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives
