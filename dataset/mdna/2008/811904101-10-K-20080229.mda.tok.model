item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview seacor holdings inc is in the business of owning  operating  investing in and marketing equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas and marine transportation industries 
the company conducts its activities in five primary business segments offshore marine services operates a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels primarily servicing offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production facilities worldwide 
marine transportation services operates a fleet of us flag product tankers carrying petroleum  crude oil and chemical products in the us coastwise trade 
inland river services is primarily engaged in the provision of dry and liquid cargo transportation on the us inland waterways for a range of agricultural and industrial products 
aviation services operates a fleet of helicopters principally providing transportation services in support of offshore oil and gas activities in the us and air medical services to hospitals 
environmental services is primarily engaged in the provision of emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the us and abroad 
other includes harbor assist and offshore towing services  various other investments in joint ventures  commodity trading activities and asset leasing activities 
all of the company s business segments  with the exception of environmental services  are asset related and highly capital intensive 
demand for the company s assets is cyclical in varying degrees  due to changes in the activity levels for those assets as well as availability of supply 
to manage capital successfully over time  the company continually assesses its asset portfolio and pursues opportunities to realize value from its assets by shifting their operation to other markets or trading them when circumstances warrant 
the company actively buys and sells second hand equipment in the ordinary course of its business  as well as designs  orders  builds  upgrades  operates or re sells newly constructed equipment 
the company typically pursues a strategy of shedding older assets while adjusting its asset mix 
the company also leases assets to other operators and sells assets to financial lessors and leases them back for varying periods of time 
the company believes that maintaining significant liquidity is an important factor that will enable it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
in recent years  the company has also sought to create balance in its businesses and broaden its asset base from support of offshore oil and gas activity  which is highly dependent on energy prices and drilling activity  by investing in barges  tankers and tugs  looking for opportunities to engage in logistics support for movement of agricultural commodities and supporting developing trades in renewable fuels 
the company is exploring opportunities to extend its aviation activities through investments in sales  marketing and distribution of aircraft and specialized parts and services  maintenance and repair facilities and fixed base operations 
in addition  the company is also looking to expand into the chinese and indian markets 
the company believes that demand for its barges  tankers and tugs is in part linked to different factors than those that drive demand for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 
in addition  for barges and tankers  contracts can often be secured with longer terms than those typically available for offshore marine and helicopter services 
the expectation is that over time this strategy of diversification will provide better returns on capital than could be achieved by restricting investment to one specific highly cyclical asset class such as marine vessels supporting offshore oil and gas activity 
the company believes this strategy will afford more opportunities to use capital efficiently  create greater stability of earnings and allow improved margins due to operational synergies which  in turn  should yield a lower cost of capital  more sustainable cash flow and increased profitability 
consolidated results of operations the company s operations are divided into five main business segments offshore marine services  marine transportation services  inland river services  aviation services and environmental services 
the company also has activities that are referred to and described under other  which primarily includes harbor and offshore towing services  energy trading activities  various other investments in joint ventures  commodity trading activities and asset leasing activities 
financial data for segment and geographic areas is reported in part iv note major customers and segment data of this annual report on form k 
offshore marine services the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
demand tends to be linked to the price of oil and gas and those prices tend to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
price levels for oil and gas can in themselves cause additional fluctuations by inducing changes in consumer behavior 
the cyclicality of the market is further exacerbated by the tendency of others to order capital assets as demand grows  often resulting in new capacity becoming available just as demand for oil and gas is peaking and activity is about to decline 
offshore oil and gas industry markets worldwide have been operating at high levels since the third quarter of when offshore drilling activity increased in response to higher oil and gas prices 
new rigs continue to be delivered with expected in although these deliveries are subject to probable delays 
the company believes that utilization in the rig market will continue at high levels in demand for vessel support services has remained high with supply largely unchanged as the introduction of new and reactivated vessels has generally been offset by retirements of older equipment 
the company believes it is likely that the supply of new vessels could begin to have an increasing influence on vessel hire rates and utilization 
the company believes there are currently in excess of new vessels on order with approximately due for delivery in  although ongoing shipyard delays could mean the actual numbers of deliveries is likely to be nearer to the impact on the market will depend upon demand remaining at high levels and the extent of older equipment retirements 
offshore marine services has actively sought to dispose of its old generation equipment while taking delivery of new vessels specifically designed to meet the changing requirements of the market 
since december   the average age of the fleet has reduced from approximately years to approximately years 
the number and type of vessels operated  their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
unless a vessel is removed from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs and  consequently  operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
the aggregate cost of offshore marine services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services costs and expenses include daily running costs and fixed costs 
daily running costs are primarily comprised of wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  which vary depending on equipment type  location and activity 
during  there was continual pressure to increase crew wages in response to chronic shortages of qualified and experienced crew throughout the world  particularly in the us gulf of mexico and west africa 
the cost of basic ship repair activities in the us gulf of mexico has also increased dramatically in the aftermath of the hurricanes  as labor shortages and increased activity levels have led to significantly higher costs 
offshore marine services expects upward cost pressures on repair and maintenance activity in the us gulf of mexico to continue in two significant components of maintenance and repair expenses are drydock and main engine overhaul costs which are both expensed as incurred 
vessel drydockings are regularly performed in accordance with applicable regulations and main engine overhauls are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs 
if a disproportionate number of drydockings or main engine overhauls are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  operating expenses are likely to vary significantly when compared with a prior year or quarter 
depreciation and charter in expenses of leased equipment are offshore marine services principal fixed costs 
depreciation depends on the acquisition costs of vessels and their related useful life and salvage value assumptions 
when vessels are sold and leased back bareboat chartered  depreciation and finance charges become indirectly incorporated into operating expenses through the lease payments made 
offshore marine services believes its diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels assist in weathering the effects of any industry downturns 
the company s strong financial position also enables offshore marine services to capitalize on opportunities as they develop for purchasing  mobilizing or upgrading vessels to meet changing market conditions

the redeployment of vessels primarily from the us gulf of mexico and asia to other geographic regions  including mexico  central and south america  west africa and the middle east added additional operating revenues of million 
in addition  operating revenues increased million due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates in the north sea region and million due to higher other marine services revenues 
operating income compared to operating income in improved by million over the improvements in operating revenues noted above were partially offset by increased operating expenses primarily due to higher crew wage expense as a result of labor shortages in most regions  higher other marine services revenues  primarily in the middle east region and an additional contribution to the united kingdom merchant navy officers pension fund 
depreciation expense was significantly lower due to the net reduction in fleet size 
gains from the disposition of assets were million in  compared to million in the prior year 
operating revenues compared to operating revenues in improved over due to several factors 
demand for equipment in most of the company s markets remained at high levels throughout in response to higher levels of exploration  production and construction activity and in the us gulf of mexico the ongoing re construction activity in the aftermath of the hurricanes 
overall average day rates improved from  per day in to  per day in  resulting in additional operating revenues of million 
a further million of the improvement was due to an increase in overall available days primarily as a result of a full year of activity for vessels acquired as a result of the acquisition of seabulk international  inc seabulk on july  through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of seacor the seabulk merger  partially offset by days lost as a consequence of vessel dispositions 
the redeployment of vessels between regions and the change of vessels from bareboat charter to time charter resulted in additional operating revenues of million 
operating revenues in the middle east region increased as a result of a full year of activity for vessels acquired as a result of the acquisition of seabulk  higher utilization and the mobilization of two additional vessels to the region 
operating revenues in mexico  central and south america decreased primarily due to a reduction in activity in mexico following the sale of a mexican joint venture in early a number of vessels that had been chartered to that joint venture were either sold to former joint venture partners or deployed for service in the us gulf of mexico 
overall fleet utilization remained flat during as compared to operating income compared to operating income in was higher than in due to a combination of improved operating revenues noted above and higher gains on asset sales 
results in included gains from asset sales of million  compared to million in the prior year 
vessels added in the seabulk merger and other variations in fleet mix as a result of fleet acquisitions and disposals resulted in additional operating expenses and depreciation of million 
the improvements in operating income were partially offset by a tightening labor market that increased wages by an average of across all regions  with the gulf of mexico experiencing increases approaching 
administrative expenses increased by primarily as a result of assimilating the seabulk organization

at december   offshore marine services had eleven vessels of various types on order or under construction at shipyards in both the us gulf of mexico and in asia 
marine transportation services in  the company s investment mix was diversified through the acquisition of a fleet of ten us flag tankers as part of the seabulk merger 
the fleet included five modern double hull product tankers  two of which had chemical carrying capacity  four double bottom vessels and one single hull vessel 
opa prohibits vessels without double hulls from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after certain dates based on the age and carrying capacity of the vessel 
in addition  single hulled vessels will be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most international markets under a phase out schedule established by the imo 
subsequent to the acquisition  two of the double bottom vessels were retro fitted to a double hull configuration thereby enabling them to continue to operate beyond their mandated retirement dates in one vessel returned to service in june  having been off hire since the fourth quarter of  and the second vessel began its retrofit in march of and returned to service in november one of the company s double bottom vessels ceased petroleum cargo operations having reached its opa mandated retirement date  the vessel completed a one way grain voyage in early and was subsequently sold to a third party for scrapping 
the company s single hull vessel  which was scheduled for retirement in  completed a one way grain voyage in early and was also sold to a third party for scrapping 
demand for the company s tankers is dependent on several factors  including petroleum production and refining levels in the united states  domestic consumer and commercial consumption of petroleum products and chemicals  competition from foreign imports and the rate of refining activity in the united states 
during and  other operators placed orders for the construction of new double hulled tankers and barges that are expected to be qualified for operation in the us coastwise trade when delivered 
the company is uncertain as to whether the market will be able to absorb this additional capacity 
during  in response to the uncertainty of both demand and supply factors and in order to secure a portion of the fleet s future earnings  marine transportation services entered into a firm nine year arrangement to bareboat charter out four vessels with staggered delivery dates 
the first vessel began its charter in march marine transportation services costs and expenses include daily running costs and fixed costs 
daily running costs are primarily comprised of wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  which vary depending on equipment type  location and activity 
the most significant components of maintenance and repair expenses are drydocking costs  which are expensed as incurred 
vessel drydockings are regularly performed in accordance with applicable regulations and if a disproportionately large number of drydockings are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with a prior year or quarter 
depreciation is marine transportation services principal fixed cost 
depreciation depends on the acquisition costs of vessels and their related useful life and salvage value assumptions 
the costs to retrofit the two double bottom vessels described above were capitalized and are being depreciated over the remaining life of the vessels 
all associated costs  including the mobilizations and regulatory drydocking costs were expensed as incurred

operating income loss compared to the reduction in operating income was primarily due to the reduction in operating revenues and significant regulatory drydocking expense for the seabulk challenge while undergoing a retrofit  the change in contract status of the seabulk mariner from time charter to long term bareboat contract commencing in march  the lost operating revenues coupled with drydocking expenses for the seabulk america  and the removal from service of the seabulk magnachem 
operating revenues compared to operating revenues increased in primarily reflecting twelve months of tanker operations compared with only six months in following the seabulk merger in july operating revenues in included million related to two foreign flagged vessels which were sold in august and september in  marine transportation services earned of its operating revenues under time charters and under contracts of affreightment 
operating income loss compared to operating income increased in primarily reflecting twelve months of tanker operations compared with only six months in following the seabulk merger in july inland river services in general  was a good year for the inland river industry despite overall freight rates not reaching levels 
in summary  the market saw strong export demand for grain  weaker northbound demand and higher operating costs  particularly for fuel and crew wages 
during the first half of the year  inland river services benefited from existing freight contracts that reduced its exposure to the spot market where rates were generally weak 
northbound loads were underpinned by term contracts that typically provided protection against rising fuel prices 
favorable changes in demurrage terms  introduced in the fall of  also helped maintain profitability 
during the second half of the year  record high grain freight rates  favorable weather in the lower mississippi river basin and good river operating conditions were tempered by difficult navigation issues on the arkansas river and drought conditions in the midwest 
the midwest drought negatively affected the dry cargo market by lowering grain production and restricting loading drafts 
demand for northbound loads weakened in the second half of the year and late rainfall hampered harvests 
as a result  demand weakened and carriers had time to reposition fleets and aggressively compete for harvest loads leading to a reduction in rates from the highs experienced early in the harvest period 
at the end of  the average age of the inland river services dry cargo barge fleet was less than five years old  which the company believes is among the youngest fleets operating on the us inland waterways system 
in contrast  inland river services believes that approximately of the existing dry cargo barge fleet and of the liquid tank barge fleet operating on the us inland waterways are over years old 
inland river services expects the relatively young age of its fleet will enhance availability and reliability and reduce downtime for repairs 
inland river services also expects the young age of its fleet to reduce replacement capital expenditures needed in future years to maintain its fleet size and thus maintain its revenue generating capacity 
as of december   the average age in years of inland river services owned and joint ventured fleet was as follows dry cargo barges liquid tank barges  barrel liquid tank barges  barrel deck barges towboats towboats have been upgraded and maintained to meet or exceed current industry standards 
as of december   inland river services controlled a total of dry cargo barges including owned  seven leased in  joint ventured and managed 
of the dry cargo barges  were chartered to  and operated by  other operators for various periods of time for a fixed rate per day 
the remaining dry cargo barges were operated by inland river services through a pooling arrangement that inland river services manages 
pursuant to these pooling arrangements  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to participants based upon the number of days the barges participate in the pool 
each barge owner is responsible for the costs of insurance  maintenance and repair as well as for capital and financing costs of its own equipment in the pool 
as of december   inland river services also controlled liquid tank  including owned  joint ventured and two leased in  and deck barges which inland river services owned 
inland river services also controlled towboats  including owned and four joint ventured 
in order to maintain control over the costs of towing  fleeting  cleaning and switching  inland river services endeavors to secure contracts of twelve months or longer with key vendors to provide these essential services 
these contracts normally include fuel price escalators and other cost escalation clauses 
in  inland river services earned of its operating revenues from participation in dry cargo barge pools that it managed  from the charter out of dry cargo barges  from liquid tank barges and from the operation of inland towboats and other activities 
the following table presents  for the years indicated  inland river services interest in the tons hauled  percentage of tons moved and percentage of operating revenues derived from the movement of cargo and earned from its participation in dry cargo barge pools 
in thousands tons percent of tons percent of revenues tons percent of tons percent of revenues tons percent of tons percent of revenues grain    non grain    dry cargo barge expenses are typically differentiated between those directly related to voyages including towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  and non voyage related expenses including repair costs  insurance and depreciation

operating revenues were also impacted by lower freight rates and reduced northbound loadings 
the decreases were partially offset by operating revenues generated by equipment added in an acquisition in march operating income compared to operating income increased in  primarily due to gains on the sale of equipment to third parties and joint ventures 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were consistent  period over period while administrative and general expenses were higher due an acquisition 
operating revenues compared to operating revenues increased in primarily due to higher freight rates for all classes of equipment  an increase in the size of the tank and deck barge fleet and other changes in fleet mix 
the industry wide supply of barges continued to decline as barge retirements outpaced new barge deliveries 
demand was positively influenced by a number of factors  including a robust corn export program  strong usage of open hopper barges in the coal and aggregate trades  and the use of barges for storage of northbound cargos in the early part of operating conditions on the rivers were generally better in due to milder winter weather resulting in less frequent equipment delays 
operating income compared to operating income increased in primarily due to the increases in operating revenues noted 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to higher repair and maintenance and towing costs and vendor service charges caused by higher labor and fuel costs 
equity in earnings of or less owned companies 
equity in earnings in were generated from the activities of an inland river services joint venture which owns a fleet of inland river transportation assets and a joint venture that operates a grain and liquid fertilizer storage and handling facility  both of which began operations in the fourth quarter of  and a south american joint venture that owns a fleet of river transportation assets that began operations in the third quarter of one of inland river services joint ventures entered into strategic positions in marketable securities and commodity futures thereby enhancing its returns 
aviation services a significant portion of aviation services operations involves transportation services provided to offshore oil and gas customers 
as with the company s offshore marine services segment  this market is highly cyclical with demand linked to the price of oil and gas which tend to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
the us gulf of mexico continues to represent aviation services major market 
aviation services current revenue stream from the support of oil and gas activities is balanced between the exploration and production activities of its customers 
exploration and development activities generally require medium size and heavy aircraft  which typically earn higher margins 
production related activities are less sensitive to variations in commodity prices and accordingly provide a more stable demand for services 
aviation services has concentrated its production support in deepwater areas and pipeline companies 
it performs very little shallow water production support 
in recent years aviation services oil company customers have been seeking modern aircraft that offer enhanced safety features and greater performance 
some customers have also been moving from small single engine aircraft to small twin engine aircraft due to the additional safety afforded from two engines when flying extended range missions in deepwater areas 
on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  era med llc eramed  acquired the air medical services business of keystone helicopter corporation 
eramed currently operates light and medium twin engine helicopters  including five owned  ten leased in and managed  in support of hospital based air medical programs  primarily in the eastern united states 
maintenance and repair expenses  employee compensation  insurance costs and fuel expenses represent a significant portion of aviation services overall operating costs 
all maintenance and repair cost  including aircraft refurbishments and engine and major component overhauls  is expensed as incurred 
should a disproportionate number of refurbishments or overhauls be undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  comparative operating expense may vary considerably 
certain third party vendors maintain the engines and components on some of aviation services helicopters are under programs that require it to pay ratably for the service based on actual flight hours flown 
the costs are normally billed on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred 
in the event that aviation services places an aircraft in a program after a maintenance period has begun it is normally necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown to date 
if a helicopter is sold before the scheduled maintenance work is carried out aviation services may be able to recover part of the expenditure incurred up to that point 
the impact of entry into and exit from these programs can have a significant impact on aviation services repair and maintenance costs 
in addition to variable operating expenses  aviation services incurs fixed charges for depreciation of aircraft and other property and equipment 
in measuring and evaluating aviation services performance  management considers flight hours flown 
these were   and  hours flown in  and respectively 
these hours are not necessarily indicative of management s expectations for future flight hours for the aviation services fleet 
flight hours in include hours flown by eramed

operating revenues in alaska were positively impacted by increased flight hours in support of oil and gas activity and higher rates 
international revenues increased as additional aircraft were placed on long term leases outside of the united states 
operating income compared to operating income in included million of gains on asset dispositions compared to gains of million in excluding the impact of these gains  operating income from flight operations increased by million 
this increase was primarily due to the improvement in operating revenues noted above  partially offset by higher operating expenses  primarily for wages and benefit costs which increased due to the eramed acquisition and because of wage increases in the u 
s gulf of mexico 
repair and maintenance costs  fuel costs and depreciation charges were also higher primarily as a result of the eramed acquisition and other net aircraft additions 
operating income also improved due to hurricane related insurance recoveries 
operating revenues compared to operating revenues in the us gulf of mexico increased as a result of net fleet additions  more efficient fleet utilization and higher rates 
alaska revenues were lower due to the redeployment of two aircraft to europe 
additionally  aviation services expanded its leasing activity to third party operators in international regions 
operating income compared to improvements in operating revenues noted above were offset by significantly higher repair and maintenance costs due to a heavy schedule of refurbishments and overhauls in in addition  other operating costs increased in primarily due to wage increases for pilots and mechanics  additional training costs associated with the introduction of new aircraft types  higher fuel prices  and continuing costs related to the hurricanes including facility repairs  housing costs and temporary help 
depreciation expense increased by million due to the growth in the fleet 
gains on the sale of assets in were million higher than in derivative expense 
in  aviation services entered into foreign currency forward contracts designated as a fair value hedge for the purchase of capital equipment 
the expense recorded in both periods represents the ineffective portion of the hedge 
environmental services environmental services charges fees for its consulting and industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment required to carry it out 
the margins on time and material services are more predictable and for the most part are larger than for fixed fee work 
the margins on equipment intensive jobs are normally higher than labor intensive jobs 
the principal components of environmental services operating expenses are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to subcontractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer  spill  consulting and other environmental business activities 
during  environmental services continued to build on its environmental and consulting base through acquisitions 
in september  it acquired an emergency management company based in the southeastern united states specializing in hurricane planning  response and recovery work 
also in september  it acquired a united kingdom based crisis management  business continuity training and consulting company 
in the fourth quarter of it acquired a us west coast based remediation  demolition  evacuation and industrial services company 
also in the fourth quarter of  it acquired a us west coast based environmental management and engineering company 
subsequent to the end of the year  it acquired a us west coast based company responsible for the management of the city of alameda s port operations 
operating results and cash flows are very dependent on the number of spill responses in a given fiscal period  the magnitude of each spill and the profit margin earned 
spill response revenues and related income can vary materially between comparable periods 
the revenues from any one period are not indicative of a trend or anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities can include payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and or the direct charge of labor  equipment and materials provided by environmental services 
profit margins vary based on the use of the company s personnel and equipment resources versus the use of third party personnel and equipment

the company s assessment of the useful economic lives of its assets are based on management s judgment  taking into consideration historical industry data  the company s own experience in operating such assets and other relevant factors 
equipment  stated at cost  is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value 
with respect to each class of asset  the estimated useful life is typically based upon a newly built asset being placed into service and represents the point at which it is typically not justifiable for the company to continue to operate the asset in the same or similar manner 
from time to time  the company may acquire older assets which have already exceeded the company s useful life policy  in which case the company depreciates such assets based on its best estimate of remaining useful life  typically the next survey or certification date
