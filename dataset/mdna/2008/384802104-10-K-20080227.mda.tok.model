item a risk factors the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 
a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
economic and industry trends affect grainger s business environments 
grainger s sales growth has tended to correlate with commercial activity  manufacturing output and non farm employment levels 
thus  a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
the facilities maintenance industry is a highly fragmented industry  and competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger s products and services 
there are several large competitors in the industry  although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors 
grainger faces competition in all markets it serves  from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market  wholesale distributors  catalog houses and retail enterprises 
competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger s sales and profitability 
unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships  resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations 
grainger s competitive strengths include product selection and availability 
products are purchased from approximately  key suppliers  no one of which accounts for more than of purchases 
historically  no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply 
if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products  there could be a short term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer term adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger s reputation 
in addition  grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors 
in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations  there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 
a delay in the completion or lower than projected results from grainger s multiyear market expansion program could negatively affect anticipated future sales growth 
in  grainger launched a six phase market expansion program in the united states to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer 
the program is being implemented in these markets in a phased approach 
the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in the second  third and fourth phases of the market expansion program were completed in phases five and six were more than complete at december   and are expected to be completed during a delay in the completion of the program or lower than projected results from the program could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 
the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth 
grainger  from time to time  expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes 
in  grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program 
the success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
the success of these expansions will depend on grainger s ability to accurately forecast market demand  obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain 
interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues  or both 
the proper functioning of grainger s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business 
although grainger s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist  information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  power losses  unauthorized access  telecommunication failures and other problems 
if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  grainger s ability to process orders  identify business opportunities  maintain proper levels of inventories  collect accounts receivable  pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 
in order to compete  grainger must attract  retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 
in order to compete and have continued growth  grainger must attract  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales  marketing and support positions 
grainger competes to hire employees  and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
grainger s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 
changes in accounting standards  subjective assumptions and estimates used by management related to complex accounting matters could have an adverse effect on results of operations 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and related accounting pronouncements  implementation guidance and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters  such as stock based compensation  insurance and inventory reserves  income taxes and postretirement healthcare benefits are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
changes in these rules or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by management could significantly change reported results

item legal proceedings grainger has been named  along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies  as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and or silica 
these lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and or silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by grainger 
as of january   grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos and or silica 
grainger has denied  or intends to deny  the allegations in all of the above described lawsuits 
in  lawsuits relating to asbestos and or silica and involving approximately plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger  typically based on the lack of product identification 
if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits  grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer 
in addition  grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance 
grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage 
while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits  it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
grainger is a party to a contract with the united states general services administration the gsa first entered into in and subsequently extended in the gsa contract has been the subject of an ongoing audit performed by the gsa s office of the inspector general the oig and grainger has previously responded to subpoenas issued by the oig in connection with its audit 
in december of  grainger received a letter from the justice department s commercial litigation branch of the civil division suggesting that grainger had not complied with the gsa contract s disclosure obligations and pricing provisions  and had potentially overcharged government customers under the contract 
on january   the justice department intervened in a civil qui tam action previously filed under seal by a former employee of grainger in the u 
s 
district court for the eastern district of wisconsin relating to the gsa contract 
the complaint alleges that grainger failed to comply with the pricing provisions of the gsa contract and that sales made by grainger pursuant to the contract violated the buy american act and trade agreement act 
the complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages  statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits 
although grainger believes that it has complied with the gsa contract in all material respects  it is unable  at this time  to predict the outcome of this matter 
in addition to the foregoing  from time to time grainger is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business  including claims relating to product liability  general negligence  environmental issues  employment  intellectual property and other matters 
as a government contractor  from time to time grainger is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings  including those related to pricing compliance and trade agreement act compliance 
it is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations

excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above  the effective income tax rate was for and for financial condition grainger expects its strong working capital position  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue  allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and repurchase of shares  as well as pay cash dividends 
cash flow net cash flows from operations of million in  million in and million in continued to improve grainger s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding 
net cash provided by operations increased million in over  driven primarily by increased net earnings 
the change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of million in this use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable as well as a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments at year end 
the increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable were due to product line expansion and increased sales 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities due to higher compensation  benefit and profit sharing accruals  the result of increased headcount and improved company performance 
the increase in net cash flows from operations from to was primarily attributable to increased net earnings 
the change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of million in this use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable  which were up due to increased sales and an increase in days sales outstanding 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below 
in  grainger continued to fund the company s market expansion initiative million  purchased mcfeely s million and purchased its distribution center in china million 
in  grainger also invested million to purchase rand and million to purchase professional equipment and construction book  which are part of the lab safety segment 
the results of operations for the acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates 
net cash flows used in financing activities for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
treasury stock purchases increased million in  as grainger repurchased  shares  compared with  shares in treasury stock purchases were  shares in as of december   approximately million shares of common stock remained available under grainger s repurchase authorization 
dividends paid to shareholders were million in  million in and million in partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
working capital internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion  supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated 
in addition  funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives  as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 
working capital was million at december   compared with  million at december   and  million at december  at these dates  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  and  respectively 
the current ratio and working capital decrease in was due to the increase in short term borrowings and a reduction in cash primarily to fund the accelerated share repurchase program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in each of the past three years  a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars land  buildings  structures and improvements furniture  fixtures  machinery and equipment subtotal capitalized software total in and  grainger s investments included the market expansion program  which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets  mexico and china expansion and the normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
in  grainger s investments included the market expansion program  ongoing sap initiatives  expenditures related to canadian branch and systems projects  as well as the normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million in these projected investments include the completion of the market expansion program in the united states  branch expansion in mexico  ongoing information technology expenditures  support for the product line expansion program  as well as other general projects including the normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
grainger expects to fund capital investments from operating cash flows  which grainger believes will remain strong 
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  grainger has various sources of financing available  including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
at december   grainger s long term debt rating by standard poor s was aa 
grainger s available lines of credit  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  were million at december   and total debt as a percent of total capitalization was  and as of the same dates 
the increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of short term borrowings used to fund an accelerated share repurchase program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of grainger s accelerated share repurchase program 
grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds  thus a portion is classified as current maturities of long term debt 
commitments and other contractual obligations at december   grainger s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows payments due by period total amounts committed less than year years years more than years in thousands of dollars long term debt obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations uncompleted additions to property  buildings and equipment commitments to purchase inventory other purchase obligations other liabilities total purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs 
while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 
payments for other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections 
other employment related benefits costs of million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to long term debt and operating lease obligations  respectively 
in addition  grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of million for tax uncertainties at december  this amount is excluded from the table above  as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivables 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates  affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
stock incentive plans 
grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors 
grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants 
the model requires projections of the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants 
the fair value of options granted in and used the following assumptions year ended december  year ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years years expected volatility expected dividend yield the risk free interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued 
the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior 
expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant 
the dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts 
because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures  using historical forfeiture experience 
the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions 
if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used  the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 
compensation expense for other stock based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 
for additional information concerning stock incentive plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the increase in market interest rates 
grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase pretax earnings by approximately million  although other changes in assumptions may increase  decrease or eliminate this effect 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index in developing its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
a percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on december  results percentage point increase decrease in thousands of dollars effect on total of service and interest cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate 
changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and  therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
income taxes 
grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities 
future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies such as revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this form k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans  strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
grainger has generally identified such forward looking statements by using words such as believe  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  intend  planned  predict  projection  potential  scheduled  assumption  presumption  may  might  would  could  and will or similar expressions 
grainger cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable 
achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause grainger s results to differ materially from those which are presented 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward looking statement include  without limitation higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  increased competitive pricing pressures  failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings  changes in laws and regulations  disruption of information technology or data security systems  general industry or market conditions  general economic conditions  labor shortages  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and the factors identified in item a  risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger s forward looking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
comparatively  in a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in net earnings for  as compared with an increase in net earnings of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 
grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio 
during and  all of its long term debt was variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately million for and million for a percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately million for and million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in long term debt levels 
grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly
