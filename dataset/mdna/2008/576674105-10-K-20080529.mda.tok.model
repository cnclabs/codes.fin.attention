item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we report segment information based on how we view our business for evaluating performance and making operating decisions 
for the periods discussed in this item  we report results on the basis of one reportable segment 
our one segment focuses on providing material based solutions for acoustical and coated applications 
our acoustical material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other materials used to manage noise and vibration quiet steel in such products as automotive body panel laminate parts  brake dampers  engine parts  appliances  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  hvac  and computer disk drives 
our coated material based solutions include coil coated and electrogalvanized eg protective and decorative coatings applied to coils of metal in a continuous  high speed  roll to roll process for such products as automotive fuel tanks  building products  appliances and lighting fixtures 
these solutions are designed to meet specific customer requirements for the automotive  building and construction  electronics  hvac  appliance and lighting markets 
we utilize a significant level of shared assets and personnel across each of our product categories 
it is common for a single customer to purchase products from several different product categories 
the general state of the principal industries in which we operate presents a number of risks including uncertainty of north american automobile industry the three largest north american automobile manufacturers continue to suffer from a challenging macro economic climate  strong foreign competition  high gasoline prices  and labor issues 
the total number of vehicles sold in the united states continues to decline 
according to autodata corporation  the april seasonally adjusted sales volume was only million vehicles  down from previous figures which had been as high as million units in recent years 
domestic automakers all continue to lose share of this declining market to foreign competitors 
sales of trucks and sports utility vehicles  which account for a disproportionate amount of our sales of quiet steel  are declining against car sales as consumers migrate to more fuel efficient vehicles 
labor instability and costs also continue to challenge the domestic automakers 
in addition  lengthy strikes at major suppliers to the auto industry negatively impact domestic auto production and sales 
all of these factors have adversely affected our revenues and profits 
pricing and availability of materials the pricing of materials includes the cost of steel  zinc and nickel  as well as  but not limited to  the cost of energy and the cost of petroleum based products 
the price of these materials has risen in the past several years as the availability has declined 
in particular  thin gauged  wide width substrates have been increasingly difficult to obtain 
overcapacity excess capacity continues to exist in the domestic coil coating and electrogalvanizing markets resulting in extreme competition in pricing  terms of sale and facility utilization 
shift in supply model as market conditions change  shifts in the supply model for certain products may occur 
we must adapt our pricing strategy accordingly  which may affect the comparability of the revenues  operating margins and working capital for the fiscal years presented 
in fiscal  we shifted the pricing of our gas tank product from a toll program to a package program which includes the cost of the metal 
in fiscal  we lost a significant portion of our hard disk drive business due to a change in disk drive design methodology at our largest customer in this sector 
we continue to evaluate our processes to improve operating effectiveness and better manage our production costs 
we have taken a disciplined approach to evaluating and implementing quality  productivity and customer care initiatives utilizing six sigma and lean manufacturing 
additionally  we have converted all of our manufacturing facilities to one enterprise resource system in order to improve the management of inventory  purchasing  and accounts receivable  among other areas 
as part of our strategic planning process  we have determined to explore strategic alternatives with respect to our manufacturing facility in morrisville  pennsylvania  including continuing operations  a possible joint venture  a strategic alliance or sale of the facility 
we closed our coil coating facility in middletown  ohio in july  and recorded a related pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal management has been considering various options regarding the disposition of this facility and related equipment including restarting production  selling  leasing  or re opening in a new location 
during the quarter ended november  
table of contents  management committed to a plan to sell this facility and related equipment 
we have initiated an active plan to sell these assets as soon as practical 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in sales  general and administrative expenses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their fair value less cost to sell of million 
these assets are classified as held for sale on our balance sheet as of february  on june   we completed a transaction for the sale of substantially all of the assets including fixed assets  intellectual property and other assets of our electronic materials and devices group emd to touchsensor technologies  llc tst in consideration of the release from current and future contractual commitments to tst and tst s assumption of certain contractual obligations of emd 
as a result of the transaction  we were relieved of the fee obligations under the license agreement with tst in fiscal of million as well as approximately million of obligations related to certain cost sharing agreements between emd and tst for the months ended in november we report emd as a discontinued operation with all prior period results of operations set forth reflecting that presentation 
in march  we completed the construction of our premier noise  vibration and harshness nvh testing and development application research center facility in michigan  which utilizes the latest in nvh testing hardware and software for the engineering  application and validation of our nvh material solutions 
in fiscal  we completed the expansion of our application development center in eisenach  germany 
in an effort to commercialize our laminate products in europe  in june  we entered into a strategic alliance with arcelormittal for the marketing  sale and manufacture of quiet steel to european automobile manufacturers 
as a part of this strategic alliance  arcelormittal provides for the production of quiet steel in its montataire  france facility while we continue to manage the product and application engineering 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we settled disputes with two suppliers related to defective materials and recorded an after tax recovery of costs of million 
we also recorded tax benefits of million  primarily related to research and development credits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and recorded an impairment charge of million  or million net of tax as a result of this test 
the net goodwill balance was zero and million as of february  and february   respectively

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal in thousands fav unfav variance net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales during the first quarter of fiscal  we began reporting sales under two types of applications  acoustical and coated  to better reflect our business mix 
sales of electronic products  which were reported separately in prior years  are reported as acoustical sales when sold for disk drive applications and as coated sales when sold for all other electronic applications 
significant changes in certain markets within each application are discussed in the following commentary about sales fluctuations 
our commentary does not necessarily reflect the fluctuations of all markets within each application  only those markets considered to have a significant impact on sales during the periods discussed 
net sales in thousands net sales application fiscal fiscal variance variance acoustical coated total sales of acoustical materials  which are primarily to automotive manufacturers  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales of body panel laminate decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the overall softness of the north american auto industry 
we expect this slowdown in the us auto market to continue at least through the first half of fiscal sales in the brake market during fiscal decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the softness in the auto industry and an overall reduction in the quantity of inventory carried by our customers 
growth in our european brake market of approximately  or an increase of million  helped to partially offset the weakness in the us auto industry 
we are actively seeking new markets  both in the us and abroad  for our acoustical products 
coated materials sales  which are primarily to appliance  building products and automotive customers  decreased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in appliance hvac sales partially offset by increased furniture and fixtures and gas tank sales 
appliance hvac sales decreased  from million to million  primarily due to extreme softness in the market related to the specific products we make for our customers 
gas tank sales increased  from million to million  principally due to new business and a change in the product formulation 
furniture and fixture sales increased  from million to million  primarily due to new business 
gross profit 
our fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit decreased over the comparable prior year by million due to decreases in product sales  a million decrease in scrap sales  partially offset by a million decrease in overhead spending  a million reduction in quality related cost and million in fees from an operating agreement with hae won with respect to operations in south korea 
despite the reductions in overhead spending in fiscal  we experienced margin compression as even the reduced level of overhead spending consumed a greater percentage of our gross margin 
sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased investment in personnel of 
table of contents million  an increase in depreciation expense of million  primarily for our application research center and our new erp system  increased travel of million as we expand internationally and increased bad debt expense as we had a reduction of bad debt expense in fiscal due to the collection of a million account receivable recovery 
these increases were offset to some extent by lower legal and professional fees of million 
goodwill 
the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company experienced a deterioration in its operating results and stock price in it fiscal fourth quarter of the result of our annual goodwill impairment test was that our goodwill was impaired and as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
the net goodwill balance was zero and million  as of february  and february   respectively 
restructuring expenses 
the production employees at our morrisville  pennsylvania facility previously worked under a union contract that expired in march we implemented new terms and conditions of employment for employees upon the contract s expiration and offered the employees a voluntary severance package 
thirty one employees accepted the voluntary severance package 
in april  we commenced hiring employees to replace those who elected the severance package 
all employees at the morrisville facility were working under the terms and conditions of employment implemented by msc upon the union contract s application in march until a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified in august  effective april  the new agreement will expire on april  we recorded restructuring expenses of million in severance and related expenses in fiscal related to this restructuring 
the entire restructuring reserve for this action was paid during fiscal total other income expense  net 
total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to interest of million received on an income tax refund and interest of million on the collection of an account receivable which had previously been written off in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal in fiscal  we began to recognize the foreign currency effect of our intercompany debt when our msc europe subsidiary began repaying intercompany debt  and recognized million of foreign currency gain 
we are restating the quarterly impact of this transaction gain in this form k

equity in results of joint venture was income of million in fiscal as compared to income of million in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled joint venture 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective rate from the prior year is primarily due to a research and development tax credit of million  or  in fiscal versus credits of million  or  for fiscal years through additionally  our valuation allowances on our net operating loss carryforwards were lower in fiscal as msc europe generated million pretax income this year

our commentary does not necessarily reflect the fluctuations of all markets within each application  only those markets considered to have a significant impact on sales during the periods discussed 
net sales in thousands net sales application fiscal fiscal variance variance acoustical coated total sales of acoustical materials  which are made primarily to automotive and disk drive manufacturers  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales of body panel laminate decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the overall softness of the north american auto industry 
according to industry statistics  production of cars and light trucks containing quiet steel declined an average of  with the production of some platforms down more than 
the significant decrease in automobile production by the us automakers in the second half of calendar has reduced the demand for body panel laminate parts 
sales in the brake market during fiscal decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the softness in the auto industry and an overall reduction in the quantity of inventory carried by our customers 
growth in our european brake market of approximately helped to partially offset the weakness in the us auto industry 
disk drive sales decreased  from million to million  as our largest customer in this sector changed its disk drive design methodology 
coated materials sales  which are primarily to appliance  building products and automotive customers  decreased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in appliance hvac sales partially offset by increased gas tank sales and lighting sales 
appliance hvac sales decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the loss of a significant film laminate customer as well as two customers moving the production of certain appliances from the us to mexico 
gas tank sales increased  from million to million  principally due to increased sales volume  a change in the product formulation and the full year impact of the change in the pricing model to a package basis from a toll basis whereby the cost of metal is now included in the sales price with little or no associated profit 
lighting sales increased  from million to million  primarily due to new business 
gross profit 
our fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior fiscal year 
of the total million decrease in gross profit  million was due to decreased sales volume  million was due to increases in raw material costs and million was due to decreases in our sales price 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by million of cost reductions and savings from quality initiatives 
the decrease in gross profit and the gross margin was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales of higher margin acoustical products 
we had additional margin compression due to the increased cost of raw materials  especially zinc and nickel  that we were not able to fully pass on to customers through pricing 
we also experienced some sales price declines primarily related to a program for one high volume product 
we experienced significant savings from our quality initiatives in managing yields  decreasing customer claims and maximizing recoveries of partially defective runs 
our overall cost of non conformance improved by as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal we are continuing to evaluate all of our processes to better manage our production costs and improve the quality of our products 
sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to a decrease in legal  consulting and professional fees of million  the collection of a million account receivable in fiscal that had been previously written off  and environmental expenses of million recorded in fiscal that did not repeat 

table of contents total other income expense  net 
total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income  net  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to interest earned on our cash balances which were higher in fiscal  interest of million received on an income tax refund and interest of million on the collection of an account receivable which had previously been written off 
equity in results of joint venture was income of million in fiscal as compared to income of million in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled joint venture and partnership 
income taxes 
our effective income tax provision rate for continuing operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the significant decrease in the effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to establishing research and development tax credits of million  or  and the closing of an internal revenue service audit of million  or 
additionally  our valuation allowances on our net operating loss carryforwards were lower in fiscal as msc europe generated million pretax income in fiscal compared to a million pretax loss in fiscal results of discontinued operations fiscal compared to fiscal emd 
on june   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our emd business 
we recorded losses of million  or per diluted common share  and million  or per diluted common share  net of income taxes  on discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
the loss in fiscal included million of severance and related costs incurred in preparation of the disposal of the emd business 
there was no discontinued operations activity for emd during fiscal and we paid all of the related severance liabilities for emd as of february  as of february   there was million recorded as current liabilities of discontinued operations emd in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note for further information on the sale of emd and see results of discontinued operations fiscal compared to fiscal included in this item below for more detail on the fiscal emd operations 
the following table shows the results of operations for emd in fiscal and in thousands net sales gross profit sg a and other expenses loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes loss on discontinued operations emd pinole point steel 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our pinole point steel business 
there was no discontinued operations activity for pinole point steel in fiscal compared to income on discontinued operations for pinole of million  net of income taxes  in fiscal the income in fiscal related to the collection of a previously written off receivable 
as of february   there was million in net liabilities remaining compared to million in net liabilities as of february  the remaining net liabilities primarily relate to workers compensation exposure not assumed by the purchasers of pinole point steel  grupo imsa sa de sa since the completion of the sale  pinole point steel has been reported as a discontinued operation 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments and sales of various assets 
we believe that our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital needs 
we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal the main components of cash generated from operating activities consisted of reduced inventory and accounts receivable amounts partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable was due to transactions from fiscal with one major customer  who is also a supplier  for whom we manufacture products 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we applied offsetting accounts receivable and accounts payable for this customer  as a result of a net cash settlement  reducing both by million 

table of contents in fiscal  we invested million in capital improvement projects compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the expenditures related to the fiscal completion of the application research center in michigan and the expansion of the application development center in europe that were significantly less in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million 
in september  we invested million in auction rate securities ars from three different funds as a preferred stockholder 
these investments are the preferred shares of large  diversified  highly rated money market funds whose common shares are actively traded 
these funds typically invest in preferred securities  convertible securities  high yield debt  common stock and senior loans of various corporate entities 
the total value of assets of these funds is between two and three times the total value of the outstanding preferred shares in which we invested 
from september to mid february  fund auctions of the ars occurred on a weekly basis and the company exercised its right to either sell the shares at auction  hold the shares and accept the new rate established by the auction  or hold the shares only if the auction reaches the company s desired rate 
subsequent to our initial investment of million in september  the company continued to purchase and sell these securities through the auction rate process 
total purchases during fiscal year were million and total sales were million 
in mid february  auctions started to fail as a result of the supply significantly exceeding demand for these investments  given the conditions in the overall economy and credit markets 
the shares bear a higher rate of interest when auctions fail  the rate is equal to of current aa commercial paper rates 
because of the shares having a preference to money market fund assets over common shares and of the highly rated and diversified underlying assets  we believe that we will be able to liquidate these investments at par within one year 
the fund managers have announced and commenced providing substantial liquidity to certain funds in which we are invested 
we liquidated million in april at par value and million in may at par value 
we have evaluated these assets for potential impairment related to the lack of liquidity and recorded a temporary impairment for million with a charge to other comprehensive income and a reduction in the carrying value of million for funds we expect to be redeemed later 
although we cannot be certain of a return of liquidity to these markets  we expect that these investments will be fully liquidated by the end of fiscal  and have therefore classified them as short term investments on our balance sheet 
on july   we signed an amendment to our million committed line of credit the line extending the expiration date to april  no other modifications were made to the original agreement 
we had an interim line of credit from april  to may  in the amount of million to cover letters of credit and operating needs if necessary 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line at the end of fiscal or borrowing capacity reserved for our outstanding letters of credit was million  and the amount remaining available to be borrowed was million as of february  at our option  interest under the line was at the bank s prime rate and as of february or  and  respectively or at libor plus a margin based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement 
the financial covenants under the line included a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  a maximum leverage ratio to  and minimum net worth of million plus of positive consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter ending on or after may   or million  as of february  as of february   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
under the line  there were restrictions on our use of cash and cash equivalents related to repurchases of stock  dividends and acquisitions 
the line was secured by specific personal property including receivables  inventory and property  plant and equipment of the company 
the interim line of credit expired on may  and was used to cover letters of credit and operating needs if necessary 
no borrowings were made on the interim line of credit 
on may   the company secured a new month million credit line new line with jp morgan chase bank  na interest on the new line is at the prime rate or libor plus 
there are annual letter of credit fees of on outstanding letters of credit  and a 
fee on the annual unused credit line 
the new line will be secured by a borrowing base of accounts receivable and liens on other assets of the company including inventory  equipment  real property and intellectual property 
the new line contains no financial statement covenants 

table of contents in february  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program whereby we may repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock 
on january   the company s board of directors approved an additional share repurchase of up to one million more shares of common stock 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for million under this program 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately million 
there were  shares remaining under these authorizations as of february  we continually review the potential for investments in our growth markets 
in addition  we also review the potential value to shareowners of divesting facilities or other assets that are not performing to our expectations 
we are a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business 
these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business 
we believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations we have outstanding as of february  in thousands 
contractual obligations obligations due in total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities unrecognized tax benefits total other long term liabilities represent the expected payments for the company s obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits 
see note retirement and savings plans to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
unrecognized tax benefits consist of million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of february  other than the operating leases presented in the table of contractual obligations 
inflation we believe that general inflation has not had a significant impact on fiscal  and results of operations 
however  as explained earlier in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we have experienced increased costs for both raw materials and energy which has had a negative impact on our gross profit in fiscal  and critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere in this form k 
while all of the significant accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements  some of the policies may be viewed to be critical 
these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about our value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title our value added content in the case of toll processing and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we record shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as 
table of contents earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
our revenue recognition policies comply with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we also record reductions to revenue for credits issued to customers resulting from manufacturing claims for product defects based upon historical experience and upon specific claims issues as they arise 
any differences between these estimates and our actual costs are recorded on a monthly basis and are reflected in the historical experience prospectively 
we had claims reserves of million as of february  including both general reserves and specifically identified reserves 
a increase in our manufacturing claims experience would have the effect of increasing the claims lag reserve by million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide for an allowance for uncollectible accounts using both specific and general estimates 
we calculate a specific reserve for disputed accounts receivable items by assessing specific receivables that are aged and assessing the aging of the total receivable pool using both historical data and current knowledge of specific items 
we calculate a general reserve based on historical experience  for bankruptcy and insolvency by applying a fixed allowance percentage to the total receivable pool 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was less than million as of february  and million as of february  a increase or decrease in our estimates would result in a change in the allowance of approximately  inventory 
we carry inventory at the lower of cost or market  using either the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out method of cost valuation 
obsolete  damaged and excessive inventories are carried at net realizable value 
historical recovery rates  current market conditions  inventory receipt date and sales plans are key factors used in the assessment of the net realizable value of obsolete  damaged and excess inventory 
we evaluate the overhead allocated to inventory based upon factory run hours and charge costs related to abnormal under utilization directly against income 
we evaluate our ability to sell inventory and recovery costs of inventory through the normal sales process and record lower of cost or market reserves in cases where we can not 
we evaluate these factors on an interim basis and we record adjustments as appropriate to reflect necessary write downs 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the determination of the recoverability of inventory which may affect our future financial statements as we re evaluate the recoverable amounts during each interim period 
we had inventory reserves of million as of february   net of scrap inventory that can be sold on the secondary market 
long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the carrying value of the long lived assets is higher than the undiscounted cash flows related to the asset group  an impairment loss may be necessary 
the impairment loss would be measured by the difference between the fair value of the assets and the carrying value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques utilize certain assumptions we made including  but not limited to  estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
we have a subsidiary in germany that had been operating in a loss position until fiscal the carrying value of the subsidiary s long lived assets was million as of february  the sales of the german subsidiary were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the pretax income loss on continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we internally realigned the sales and expenses related to our strategic alliance with arcelormittal based on our transfer pricing policy 
accordingly  our domestic corporate operation collects all related sales and pays our german subsidiary for all routine support services at cost plus a reasonable profit 
in fiscal  our domestic corporate operation was charged million  net of royalties collected  by our german subsidiary 
we believe  based on current projections  that the operations will generate future cash flows sufficient to support the carrying value of the long lived assets 
consequently  no write down of these assets is necessary at this time 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets 
table of contents and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the assessment considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse in the jurisdiction to which the deferred tax asset relates 
this evaluation is primarily based on our historical earnings  projected operating results  applicable net operating loss carryforward expiration dates and identified actions under our control in realizing the associated carryforward benefits 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we had million of gross deferred tax assets as of february   resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which may reduce taxable income in future periods to the extent we generate profits 
these assets relate to federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
the federal net operating loss generated in fiscal will be carried back to fiscal and fully utilized 
therefore  no valuation allowance is needed for the deferred tax asset related to this federal net operating loss 
the valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax assets is million as of february  included in these amounts is a million deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences incurred by msc europe and an offsetting valuation allowance of million 
msc europe incurred operating losses since commencing business in fiscal until earning a million pretax profit in fiscal and a million pretax profit in fiscal we will continue to evaluate the amount and need for this and any other valuation allowances based on historical earnings  projected operating results and other factors described above 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions are million offset by deferred tax assets of million at february  retirement plans 
the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans including the non contributory supplemental pension plans for some of our officers and other postretirement health care plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled retirement and savings plans 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by using a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate at which the obligation could be effectively settled and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected 
a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the net pension expense by less than million and decrease the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the net pension expense by million and increase the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the estimated future return on plan assets would have a million relative effect on fiscal net pension expense 
the estimated future return on plan assets for the fiscal pension benefit income calculation is 
environmental reserves 
we are a party to various legal proceedings in connection with the remediation of certain environmental matters 
we record these environmental reserves based upon historical experience and the extent of relevant information available from various third parties 
there are a number of assumptions that are made  including  without limitation  the estimated extent of the environmental damage to any particular site  the available methods of remedy  the contribution expected from various other potentially responsible parties and the discretionary authority of federal and state regulatory authorities in bringing enforcement actions 
we believe our range of exposure for these proceedings and known sites is million to million and as of february   have approximately million in environmental reserves 

table of contents accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurement 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements
