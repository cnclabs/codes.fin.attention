item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an aesthetic and therapeutic company focused on developing novel skin and tissue rejuvenation products 
our clinical development product candidates are designed to improve the appearance of skin injured by the effects of aging  sun exposure  acne and burns with a patient s own  or autologous  fibroblast cells produced in our proprietary isolagen process 
our clinical development programs encompass both aesthetic and therapeutic indications 
our most advanced indication utilizing the isolagen process is for the treatment of wrinkles and is currently in phase iii clinical development 
we have also initiated a phase ii iii study in acne scars  a phase ii study for restrictive burn scars and have ongoing phase ii trials in full face rejuvenation and periodontal disease 
we also develop and market an advanced skin care product line through our agera laboratories  inc subsidiary  in which we acquired a interest in august we sometimes refer to our product candidates in the aggregate as isolagen therapy 
from through  we made isolagen therapy available to physicians primarily in the united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved closing our united kingdom operation 
our united kingdom operation was shutdown on march  as more fully discussed in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements and below 
we have refocused our management and capital resources on the management of our clinical trials  and funding thereof 
we market and sell an advanced skin care line through our majority owned subsidiary  agera  which we acquired in august agera offers a complete line of skincare systems based on a wide array of proprietary formulations  trademarks and nano peptide technology 
agera markets its product in both the united states and europe primarily the united kingdom 
we are considered to be a development stage enterprise 
going concern at december   we have cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and working capital of million including our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we believe that its existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations through at least september  we estimate that we will require additional cash resources during the third quarter of based upon our current operating plan and condition 
this estimate excludes any proceeds that would be realized upon the sale of the swiss campus discussed further below under factors affecting our capital resources 
through december   we have been primarily engaged in developing our initial product technology and recruiting personnel 
in the course of our development activities  we have sustained losses and expect such losses to continue through at least we expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash and any future financing  including the sale of assets 
however  there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will be required to obtain additional capital in the future to continue our operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital as we need to finance these efforts  through asset sales  equity or debt financing  or any combination thereof  or on satisfactory terms or at all 
additionally  no assurance can be given that any such financing  if obtained  will be adequate to meet our ultimate capital needs and to support our growth 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms  our operations would be materially negatively impacted 
further  if we do not obtain additional funding prior to or during the third quarter of  we may enter into bankruptcy during and possibly cease operations thereafter 
we filed a shelf registration statement on form s during june  which was subsequently declared effective by the sec 
the shelf registration allows us the flexibility to offer and sell  from time to time  up to an original amount of million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or any combination of the foregoing in one or more future public offerings 
in august  we sold under this shelf registration statement  shares of common stock to institutional investors  raising proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
we may offer and sell up to an additional of common stock pursuant to this shelf registration 

table of contents our ability to complete additional offerings  including any additional offerings under our shelf registration statement  is dependent on the state of the debt and or equity markets at the time of any proposed offering  and such market s reception of our company and the offering terms 
in addition  our ability to complete an offering may be dependent on the status of our clinical trials  and in particular  the status of our phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of wrinkles  which cannot be predicted 
we are also continuing its efforts to sell our swiss campus see note 
we will add any proceeds from the sale of the swiss campus to our working capital  which would partially alleviate our need to obtain financing from other sources 
there is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us  and if available  on terms and conditions that are acceptable 
as a result of the above discussed conditions  and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  and our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to secure additional adequate financing or capital prior to or during the third quarter of if we are unable to obtain additional sufficient funds during this time  we will be required to terminate or delay our efforts to obtain regulatory approval of one  more than one  or all of our product candidates  curtail or delay the implementation of manufacturing process improvements and or delay the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities 
any of these actions would have an adverse effect on our operations  the realization of our assets and the timely satisfaction of our liabilities 
our financial statements are presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm  bdo seidman  llp  contains a modification concerning our ability to continue as a going concern 
closure of the united kingdom operation as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate the best uses of our resources  in the fourth quarter of our board of directors approved the proposed closing of the united kingdom operation 
on march   we completed the closure of the united kingdom manufacturing facility 
the united kingdom operation was located in london  england with two locations  a manufacturing site and an administrative site 
both sites are under operating leases 
the manufacturing site lease expires february and  as of december   the remaining lease obligation approximated million 
the administrative site lease expired in april since our public announcement regarding the closure of the united kingdom operation  we have received negative publicity and negative correspondence from former patients in the united kingdom that previously received our treatment 
more recently  we received a written demand by an attorney representing approximately former patients each claiming negligent misstatements were made and each claiming  on average   or approximately  plus unquantified interest and incidental expenses 
we are in the process of evaluating the merits of the claims made in the demand 
to date  no formal legal action has been brought by the attorney against the company  and no provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements related to this matter 
with the closure of the united kingdom operation on march   our european operations both the united kingdom and switzerland and australian operations have been presented in the financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of the control of management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical operations  our future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses our critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents going concern as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
this conclusion is based on estimates of our future spending and future funding required during we will be required to obtain additional capital in to continue and expand our operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital as it needs to finance these efforts  through asset sales  equity or debt financing  or any combination thereof  or on satisfactory terms or at all 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was million 
for the year ended december   our cash used in operations and investing activities was nearly million 
these factors  as well as our future spending estimates  were important factors in concluding that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe these estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position 
our financial statements are presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  based on the grant date fair value of those share based payments  adjusted for expected forfeitures 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  the fair value measurement requirements of sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that were outstanding as of january  is recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after january  the compensation cost for that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before january  are precluded 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for awards in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we followed the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
to account for our employee and director stock options 
historically  substantially all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized from substantially all option grants to employees and directors prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
however  compensation expense was recognized in connection with the issuance of stock options to non employee consultants in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services 
sfas no 
r did not change the accounting for stock based compensation related to non employees in connection with equity based incentive arrangements 

table of contents the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangement 
this change in accounting resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of million and million related to our employee and director stock options for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we granted stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested director and employee stock options which vest over time 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance based  non vested employee stock options 
that cost will begin to be recognized when the performance criteria within the respective performance base option grants become probable of achievement 
during december  the board of directors approved the full vesting of all unvested  outstanding stock options issued to current employees and directors 
the board decided to take this action the acceleration event in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as a result of this acceleration event  stock options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were vested that would have otherwise vested during and later periods 
at the time of the acceleration event  the unamortized grant date fair value of the affected options was approximately million for sfas no 
and sfas no 
pro forma disclosure purposes  which was charged to pro forma expense in the fourth quarter of substantially all of the unvested employee stock options that were subject to the acceleration event had exercise prices above market price of our common stock at the time the board approved the acceleration event 
however  in accordance with sfas r if we had not completed this acceleration event in december  the majority of the million amount discussed above would have been charged against the future results of operations  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and continuing through later periods as the options vested 
as discussed above  substantially all of the unvested employee stock options which were accelerated had exercise prices above market price at the time of acceleration 
for the purposes of applying apb no 
to such stock options in the statement of operations for the year ended december   the acceleration event was treated as the acceleration of the vesting of employee and director options that otherwise would have vested as originally scheduled  and accordingly was not a modification requiring the remeasurement of the intrinsic value of the options  or the application of variable option accounting  under apb no 
for stock options that had exercise prices below market price at the time of acceleration and that would not have vested originally  a charge of approximately  was recorded in the statement of operations for the year ended december  in march  and in connection with the separation of the company s president  the company agreed to modify certain of the president s stock options such that  unvested  time based stock options would vest immediately and of  performance based stock options   would be cancelled and the remaining  would be extended such that the  options would expire years from the original grant date  as opposed to expiring upon termination of employment 
the  performance based stock options will continue to be subject to the same performance based vesting requirements 
the  modified stock options were valued using the black scholes valuation model  and resulted in million charge to selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  the  modified performance stock options were valued using the black scholes valuation model  and resulted in million charge to selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  two other employee stock option modifications resulted in less than million charge to selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  accounting for legal matters as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  set forth elsewhere in this report  we are currently defending ourselves against various class and derivative actions 
we have also received threats of litigation and demands from former patients associated with our united kingdom operation 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these actions  and no provision has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  a loss must be both reasonably estimable and probable in order to record a provision for loss 
we will expense our legal costs as they are incurred and will record any insurance recoveries on such legal costs in the period the recoveries are received 
although we have not recorded a provision for loss regarding these matters  a loss could occur in a future period 
we are involved in various other legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters  management currently believes that the results will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
results of operations comparison of years ending december  and revenues 
revenue increased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our revenue from continuing operations is from the operations of agera which we acquired on august  agera markets and sells a complete line of advanced skin care systems based on a wide array of proprietary formulations  trademarks and non peptide technology 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that agera had been acquired on january   our revenue would have been million for the year ended december  due to our financial statement presentation of our united kingdom operation as a discontinued operation  our revenue for all periods presented is representative of only agera  as all historical united kingdom revenue is reflected in loss from discontinued operations 
we currently expect first quarter revenue to be approximately million 
cost of sales 
costs of sales increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our cost of sales relates to the operation of agera 
as a percentage of revenue  agera cost of sales were approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis  assuming agera had been acquired on january   our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been for the full year ended december  the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue  as compared to  is primarily due to selling price increases implemented during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december    as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the following a additional severance expense and related costs associated with the termination of our president  pursuant to a settlement agreement executed in june  resulted in an additional million of selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
b salaries  bonuses and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due to an increase in the average number of our employees  primarily at the executive management level  which resulted in higher salary expense 
the higher salary expense was partially offset by lower bonuses earned for the year ended december  as compared to december  c marketing expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  due primarily to marketing and promotional efforts related to marketing and selling our agera line of advanced skin care systems 
d travel expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  due to the increase in the number of our employees  primarily at the executive management level  and increase in business development activities during 
table of contents e other general and administrative operating costs increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to costs of approximately million related to our withdrawn and terminated debt offering  increased business development activities and increased investor relations costs of million for the year ended december   as well as the addition of general expenses related to our august acquisition of agera

if we had not received these reimbursements  our legal expenses would have been million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  excluding the insurance carrier reimbursement  legal expenses remained relatively consistent 
in general  our legal expense  net  fluctuates primarily as a result of the level of class action and derivative action defense costs incurred during a particular period and as a result of the timing of related insurance carrier reimbursements for defense costs 
such reimbursements are recorded when received 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on september  the court denied our motion to dismiss the complaint in the federal securities litigation against us  and on november  the court entered a scheduling order that provides that discovery be completed by june  the commencement of the discovery process in this matter will likely cause legal expenses to increase in research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development costs are composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for our isolagen therapy for specific dermal applications in the united states  as well as costs related to other potential indications for our isolagen therapy  such as acne scars and burn scars 
also  research and development expense includes costs to develop manufacturing  cell collection and logistical process improvements 
research and development costs primarily include personnel and laboratory costs related to these fda trials and certain consulting costs 
the total inception to date cost of research and development as of december  was million 
the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for our dermal product candidate or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations  as occurred during with respect to our previously conducted phase iii wrinkle nasolabial fold trial  the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the complexities of the fda approval process  we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval for our dermal product candidate will be at this time 
the major changes in research and development expenses are due primarily to the following a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased expenditures related to our current wrinkle nasolabial fold study and acne scar study  and preparations related to other clinical trials such as restrictive burn scars

interest income 
interest income decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income of million resulted from a decrease in the amount of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balances  as a result of our use of these balances primarily to fund our normal operating activities related to our efforts to gain fda approval for our isolagen therapy

table of contents working capital at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and working capital of million including our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
the substantial majority of our working capital change  as compared to december   relates to the use of our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments for the purpose of funding and operating our business  offset by the cash proceeds from our million common stock sale in august our ability to operate profitably is contingent upon our success in obtaining additional capital or financing  obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates  development of markets for our products  and development of profitable scalable manufacturing processes 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations through at least september   but we will need to engage in a capital raising transaction during or we will need to significantly modify our business plan in order to sustain our operations 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates  successfully develop the markets for our product candidates or develop profitable scalable manufacturing processes or obtain the capital we require  on a timely basis or on terms that we would find acceptable  or at all 
further  if we do not obtain additional funding prior to or during the third quarter of  we may enter into bankruptcy during and possibly cease operations thereafter 
our ability to raise equity or debt financing may be dependent on the status of our phase iii clinical trial related to our lead facial aesthetic product candidate  which cannot be predicted 
if we are able to raise additional capital  it will likely result in dilution to our current stockholders  which may be substantial 
factors affecting our capital resources in april  we acquired a two building   square foot corporate campus in bevaix  canton of neuch tel  switzerland for million 
the million purchase price was paid using cash on hand from the proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
our initial estimate of the total cost of acquisition and renovation of the facility  including the purchase of required equipment  was million  which includes approximately million we had spent in renovations 
the corporate campus is classified as assets of discontinued operations held for sale at december  with a value of million  reflecting the fair value of the corporate campus 
fair value is defined as the price at which an asset would change hands in a transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller in an unforced transaction 
however  if we were to sell the swiss campus in a forced transaction or a distress sale  it is likely that the price we would receive would be less  and we would recognize a loss  which may be significant  upon such sale 
as the result of our cash position at december  and our need for funding  it is possible that we will choose or be required to sell the swiss campus under such conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years long term debt obligations  excluding interest interest lease obligations purchase obligations obligations in connection with acquisition total the table above assumes that our convertible subordinated notes will be called due on november  refer to the below for a description of our convertible subordinated notes 
in addition to the above  we have  in the ordinary course of business  various contractual agreements with various consultants and service providers whereby a fee or rate per hour has been agreed to  but no guaranteed minimums have been established 
generally  such agreements are related to our research and development efforts or general operating matters 
the above table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which illustrate a net loss of million and net cash used in operations of million during in august  we paid million in cash to acquire a interest in agera and also we agreed to contribute million to the working capital of agera to support marketing and inventory acquisitions 
in addition  the acquisition agreement includes future contingent payments up to a maximum of million 
such additional purchase price is based upon certain percentages of agera s cost of sales incurred after june  accordingly  based upon the financial performance of agera  up to an additional million of purchase price may be due to the selling shareholder in future periods 
we believe any such payments will not be significant in fiscal year the timing of future payments may differ from the estimates above  and will depend on the future operating performance of agera 

table of contents in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   although these notes may be due sooner as discussed below 
the notes are our general  unsecured obligations 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment  which means that they rank in right of payment behind other indebtedness of ours 
in addition  the notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we will be required to repay the full principal amount of the notes on november  unless they are previously converted  redeemed or repurchased 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance of the notes 
we will pay interest twice a year  on each may and november  until the principal is paid or made available for payment or the notes have been converted 
interest will be calculated on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months 
the note holders may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on november   unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased 
the initial conversion rate which is subject to adjustment for the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
holders of notes called for redemption or submitted for repurchase will be entitled to convert the notes up to and including the business day immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase 
at any time on or after november   we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any to  but excluding  the redemption date 
the note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on november of  and in addition  if we experience a fundamental change which generally will be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading of our common stock  note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur on or prior to november   we will also pay a make whole premium to holders that require us to purchase their notes in connection with such fundamental change 
off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in material off balance sheet transactions 
other inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on our results for year ended december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange rate risk the effect of us dollar currency fluctuations against the foreign currency in these countries is somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which the revenue is generated 
our income will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
additionally  approximately of our assets at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations were based in our foreign operations and translated into us dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of each accounting period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of consolidated shareholders deficit 
substantially all of the in foreign assets relates to our swiss campus held for sale  with a value of million at december  accordingly  our consolidated shareholders deficit will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
as a result of changing foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december  has swung to an accumulated other comprehensive gain of million at december   or a change of approximately million 
however  this million gain is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized gain may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
interest rate risk our  million convertible subordinated notes  pay interest at a fixed rate and  accordingly  we are not exposed to interest rate risk as a result of this debt 
however  the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes does vary based upon  among other factors  the price of our common stock and current interest rates on similar instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
