in addition  we have a interest in americold realty trust americold  which owns and operates cold storage warehouses nationwide  a interest in alexander s inc  which has seven properties in the greater new york metropolitan area  and a interest in toys r us  inc toys which has a significant real estate component  as well as other real estate and related investments 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
principal factors of competition are effective rents  attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national  regional and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value  which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders 
the table below compares our total return performance to the morgan stanley reit index rms for the following periods ending december  past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance total return vornado rms one year three years five years ten years beginning in the second half of  the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress  primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub prime mortgages and declining residential housing prices nationwide 
this credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit markets and has generally reduced the availability of financing and widened spreads 
these factors  coupled with a slowing economy  may negatively impact the volume of real estate transactions and cap rates  which would negatively impact stock price performance of public real estate companies  including ours 
our one year total return to shareholders for the period ending december  was negative and the rms total return for the same period was negative 
although our core operating results were not negatively impacted by these conditions in  if these conditions persist in and beyond  our real estate portfolio may experience lower occupancy and effective rents which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flows 
in addition  the value of our investments in joint ventures  marketable securities and mezzanine loans may also decline as a result of the above factors 
such declines may result in impairment charges and or valuation allowances which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations 
we intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit  investing in properties in select markets  such as new york city and washington  dc  where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation  acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents  investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the new york city metropolitan area  investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component  developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value  and providing specialty financing to real estate related companies

in connection with purchase accounting  in july and april we recorded an aggregate of  of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities 
we were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because h street and its partially owned entities were operated as c corporations at the time they were acquired

in august  mr 
trump brought a lawsuit in the new york state supreme court against  among others  the general partners of the partnerships referred to above 
mr 
trump s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of  and use of proceeds from  the sale of properties located on the former penn central rail yards between west th and nd streets in manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships 
in decisions dated september  and july   the court denied various of mr 
trump s motions and ultimately dismissed all of mr 
trump s claims  except for his claim seeking access to books and records 
in a decision dated october   the court determined that mr 
trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled  with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to mr 
trump 
mr 
trump has sought re argument and renewal on  and filed a notice of appeal in connection with  his dismissed claims 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of mr 
trump s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action  provided however  that if mr 
trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters  other than claims relating to sale price  the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims 
we believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit 
all other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements

investments in mezzanine loans at december  and  we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of  net of a  allowance and  respectively  substantially all of which are loans to companies that have significant real estate assets

these shares were classified as available for sale marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
during october  we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of per share and recognized a net gain of  representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership 
during the second half of  we acquired an economic interest in an additional  mcdonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on mcdonalds common shares 
these call and put options had an initial weighted average strike price of per share  or an aggregate of  and provided for net cash settlement 
under these agreements  the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of libor plus basis points and was decreased for dividends received 
the options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of libor plus basis points 
because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as investment income or loss on our consolidated statements of income 
in  we sold  of these shares at a weighted average price of per share  and acquired an additional  option shares at a weighted average price of per share 
as of december   there were  option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of per share

in the future  we may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings  debt financings or asset sales  although we have no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions 
we may also offer our shares or operating partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re acquire our shares or any other securities in the future 
convertible senior debentures due on march   we sold billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due  pursuant to an effective registration statement 
the aggregate net proceeds from this offering  after underwriters discounts and expenses  were approximately billion 
the debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in   and and in certain other limited circumstances 
the debentures are convertible  under certain circumstances  for cash and vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of common shares per  of principal amount of debentures 
the initial conversion price was  which represented a premium of over the march  closing price for our common shares 
the principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or  at our election  vornado common shares 
we are amortizing the underwriters discount on a straight line basis which approximates the interest method over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of april  because the conversion option associated with the debentures  when analyzed as a freestanding instrument  meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs to of eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own common stock  separate accounting for the conversion option under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is not appropriate 
the net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the operating partnership in the form of an inter company loan and the operating partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures

actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we incorrectly estimate the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of our estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
identified intangible assets upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
we amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset  including the related real estate when appropriate  is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets  a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
in addition  the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities  a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
if the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired  or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change  the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 
critical accounting policies continued mezzanine loans receivable we invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets 
these investments  which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property  are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate 
we record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were  and  respectively 
we accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method  or straight line method if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether they are impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the impact of our estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of our loans could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were billion and billion  respectively 
in determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  or receive the majority of the expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
we account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met  and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial assets and liabilities on january  the fasb has deferred the implementation of the provisions of sfas relating to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until january  sfas is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value  but may result in certain additional disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires an employer to i recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status  ii measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and iii recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income 
the adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements as of december  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective on january  the adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for us on january  we have not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future 
on august   the fasb issued a proposed fasb staff position the proposed fsp that affects the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and series d convertible preferred units 
the proposed fsp requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and series d convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting discount must be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense 
if adopted  we expect that the proposed fsp would be effective for our fiscal year beginning on january  and would require retroactive application 
the adoption of the proposed fsp on january  would result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of  as of december  on our consolidated balance sheet and additional interest expense on our consolidated statements of income 
our current estimate of the incremental interest expense  net of minority interest  for each reporting period is as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended december recently issued accounting literature continued in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r broadens the guidance of sfas  extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
it broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
sfas r expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective for all transactions entered into on or after january  the adoption of this standard on january  could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate  as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation

th street bergen town center fifth avenue green acres mall lexington avenue other funds from operations ffo ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control 
our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt all of which arises out of non trading activity is as follows amounts in thousands  except per share amounts december  balance weighted average interest rate effect of change in base rates december  balance weighted average interest rate consolidated debt variable rate fixed rate pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities non recourse variable rate excluding toys variable rate toys fixed rate including  and  of toys debt in and minority limited partners share of above total change in annual net income per share diluted we may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings  including hedging strategies  depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
as of december   variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of  and a weighted average interest rate of was subject to libor caps 
these caps are based on a notional amount of  and cap libor at a weighted average rate of 
as of december   we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of  that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
fair value of our debt the fair value of our debt at december  approximates its aggregate carrying amount  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt 
derivative instruments we have  and may in the future enter into  derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we are  and may in the future be  subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over libor 
because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods  we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense 
during  and we recognized net gains aggregating approximately   and  respectively  from these positions
