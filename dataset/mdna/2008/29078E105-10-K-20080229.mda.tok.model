telecommunications segment we offer six general categories of products and services through our telecommunications segment voice  data  high speed internet  wireless  product and other 
we currently provide a wide range of products and services through these categories  including the following voice local services we offer local calling services to consumer and business customers within our local service territories  generally for a fixed monthly charge 
while we have achieved significant pricing deregulation over time  the maximum amount that we can charge a customer for local calling services is still largely governed by state and or federal regulatory authorities and  as a practical matter  by our competitors 
we also offer a number of enhanced calling features and other services  such as call forwarding  caller identification  voicemail  call waiting and inside wire installation and maintenance services  for which we generally charge an additional monthly fee 
we also generate revenue from non recurring services  such as service activation and reactivation 
as of december   we had approximately million consumer access lines and million business access lines 
long distance we offer long distance voice and data services through a wholesale arrangement with sprint nextel 
long distance voice calling services are priced either based on usage or pursuant to flat rate calling plans 
these services include traditional switched long distance  toll free calling  international  calling card and operator services 
we also offer some long distance voice and data services to large business customers as an agent of sprint nextel 
sales agency revenues are reported as other service revenue 
access services we sell various forms of access services to long distance carriers  wireless carriers and clecs thereby enabling connectivity with their networks and facilitating our local customers ability to make or receive calls to or from markets controlled by other carriers 
we also receive reciprocal compensation from other carriers for terminating interconnected local and wireless calls 
access charges for interstate and international calls are regulated by the federal communications commission  or fcc  while access charges for intrastate calls are regulated by the state public utility commissions  or pucs 
wholesale service pursuant to fcc regulations  we offer certain of our network facilities to clecs on a resale and unbundled basis  such as unbundled network elements  or unes  and allow them to collocate some of their equipment in our central offices 
the fcc sets general guidelines for pricing of resale  unes and collocation and the state pucs approve the actual prices charged 
as of december   we had approximately million wholesale access lines  including resale and payphone lines 
universal service receipts and surcharges voice revenues include universal service fund receipts and surcharges 
the telecommunications act of  or telecom act  requires that providers of telecommunications services offer local service at affordable rates to customers living in rural  insular or other high cost areas that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas 
as required by the telecom act  telecommunications service providers must contribute to the federal universal service fund  or usf  and other state regulated programs based on a percentage of their gross revenues 
we recover our contributions to these programs from our customers through surcharges on revenues  as well as receive federal and state universal service subsidies for certain high cost areas that we serve 
see legislative and regulatory developments for additional information on federal and state universal service programs 
data we offer a range of data services to businesses  long distance carriers  wireless carriers and clecs 
our most significant data service is special access  which consists of dedicated circuits used to connect the customer s business sites or networks to ours  to connect the customer s networks directly to their customers locations  or  in the case of wireless carriers  to connect their cell sites with their mobile switching centers 
although the traffic handled through special access facilities may include voice as well as data  we report revenues associated with special access as data revenue 
high speed internet as of december   we provided high speed internet access services to nearly million subscribers 
our primary high speed internet offering features a download speed of up to mbps  but we also offer download speeds ranging from kbps to mbps 
we also generate revenue through the newly launched embarq branded web portal  myembarq 
com  which offers a variety of enhanced services for our hsi subscribers  such as e mail with unlimited storage  music and video downloads  commercial free radio  discounted access to popular web sites  news  games  and other content 
wireless we currently offer wireless services through a wholesale arrangement involving a mvno relationship with sprint nextel

sales agency revenues are reported as other service revenue 
currently  sprint nextel s wireless network covers approximately of our local service territories 
as of december   we had thousand wireless subscribers 
our wireless service has been and continues to be dilutive to our results of operations  but we have and continue to take the actions necessary to improve these results 
in late  we began to take steps to minimize dilution  such as modifying our offerings and credit policies to more selectively target customers and reducing related advertising and promotional expenses 
in  we have continued to evaluate our approach to optimize the performance of our wireless business 
in connection with that evaluation  we will take certain steps to accomplish an orderly transition away from our current approach to our mvno arrangement and will further evaluate our wireless service offerings 
product revenues we sell and service a range of customer premises equipment  or cpe  which is communications equipment that resides at a business customer s location for the management of voice and data networks and applications 
we provide cpe to our business customers through sales  engineering  and distribution relationships with a small number of primary vendors

wholesale markets wholesale markets generated billion  or  of our total reported net operating revenue 
wholesale markets offers a variety of network based products and database services to local  long distance and wireless customers 
carriers utilize these wholesale products as part of their infrastructure and support systems in providing end user retail services 
key products for this group include switched and special access  collocation  database  directory assistance  operator services  high speed data  unbundled network elements  or unes  and access to network signaling systems 
with the growth in wireless voice and data services  wireless carriers operating within our local service territories are increasingly purchasing wholesale services to link their towers and to interconnect with our wireline networks 
as of december   wholesale markets also provided public access services to approximately thousand pay telephone units in states and the district of columbia 
further  through account relationships  wholesale markets provides communications services to inmates at state and county correctional institutions 
our wholesale marketing approach includes direct sales calls to our carrier customers in the inter exchange long distance  wireless  clec  and internet service provider  or isp  market segments 
wholesale revenues are derived primarily from switched access for originating and terminating long distance calls  special access to provide dedicated links between customer premises and carrier networks  intelligent network database services and interconnection services to link networks between carriers 
approximately billion of our wholesale revenues are derived from our top carriers 
our employees work closely with these customers to develop products and services that address their specific needs and to ensure that we continue to be the wholesale provider of choice within our local service areas 
in addition  our dedicated account managers and supporting sales engineers consult with these customers on network design and application needs 
wholesale customers have access to the majority of our products and services through our wholesale website and through tariffs that are filed with state and federal regulatory agencies 
we have improved our wholesale website both to enhance our customer experience and to simplify the nature of calls to our wholesale service centers 
wholesale markets is focused on providing superior network service quality and products tailored specifically to our customers business needs and improving order flow between our internal systems and our customers systems 
logistics logistics generated billion  or of our reported revenue

embarq offers facilities based services in each of our markets 
in addition to the equipment noted above  our fully integrated communications network is comprised of ip routers  ethernet switches  asynchronous transport mode atm switches and frame relay switches capable of handling voice  data and dedicated circuits 
rapid and significant changes in technology are expected in the communications industry 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes 
we believe that our network architecture enables us to respond efficiently to these technological changes 
our relationship with sprint nextel in connection with our spin off  we entered into certain agreements with sprint nextel 
the key terms of the principal agreements that continue to be operative are summarized below separation and distribution agreement 
we entered into a separation and distribution agreement that generally requires both sprint nextel and us to indemnify each other and each other s representatives and affiliates against certain liabilities 
the separation and distribution agreement also contains the terms of the spin off and certain covenants regarding cooperation to effect the transactions contemplated by the spin off 
the agreement also governs rights both sprint nextel and we have to access certain of each other s information following the spin off 
as of december   all material provisions of this agreement had been satisfied 
as an ancillary agreement to the separation and distribution agreement  we also entered into an employee matters agreement relating to certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to our current and former employees 
tax sharing agreement 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with sprint nextel 
the tax sharing agreement covers our and sprint nextel s rights and obligations with respect to taxes for both the pre and post spin off periods 
as of december   settlement of the parties rights and obligations relating to certain pre spin off periods is still pending 
we have reflected the estimated amounts that may be due from or to sprint nextel pursuant to this agreement  in the consolidated balance sheets 
these estimates are based on preliminary calculations  which are still subject to further adjustment based on the agreed processes to resolve these matters  including arbitration 
under the tax sharing agreement  in order to preserve the tax free treatment to sprint nextel of the spin off  for specified periods of up to months following the spin off  we may be prohibited  except in specified circumstances  from issuing  redeeming or being involved in other acquisitions of our equity securities  transferring significant amounts of our assets  amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  failing to comply with the internal revenue service irs requirement for a spin off that embarq engage in the active conduct of a trade or business after the spin off  or engaging in other actions or transactions that could jeopardize the tax free status of the spin off 
a private letter ruling issued by the irs after the spin off provides us with the flexibility to pursue open market repurchases of our common stock without adversely affecting the tax free status of our spin off from sprint nextel 
we have an obligation to indemnify sprint nextel for taxes resulting from the spin off if that tax results from an issuance of our equity securities  a redemption of our equity securities or our involvement in other acquisitions of our equity securities  other actions or failures to act by us such as those described above or any of our representations or undertakings referred to in the tax sharing agreement being incorrect or violated 
we currently do not believe these prohibitions impose a significant constraint on our flexibility to execute on our existing strategy 
intellectual property agreements 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a patent agreement  software and proprietary information agreement and a trademark assignment and license agreement with sprint nextel 
these agreements  as amended  govern embarq s relationship with sprint nextel with respect to ownership of and use of intellectual property 
transition services agreements 
we entered into transition services agreements with sprint nextel under which both parties agreed to provide certain specified services to one another for up to two years following the spin off 
as of december   we have exited the majority of these agreements and expect that we will exit the remaining agreements according to their terms 
commercial service agreements 
we and sprint nextel entered into commercial service agreements pursuant to which each company obtains services from one another 
the principal agreements  as amended  are described below we entered into a non exclusive wholesale agreement  which we refer to as the mvno agreement  with sprint nextel 
under this agreement  for a period of years  we are able to resell certain cdma based wireless voice and data services in our local service territories 
under a year wholesale master services agreement with sprint nextel  that we refer to as the long distance agreement  we have the ability to market and sell our own branded wireline long distance voice and data services to consumer and small business customers 
under this agreement  we must purchase a minimum of of our volume at the date of spin off for certain categories of domestic and international long distance voice and data services from sprint nextel 
in addition to the mvno agreement and long distance agreement  we have also entered into a sales agency agreement with sprint nextel to sell to business customers certain sprint nextel branded wireless and wireline voice and data services  and a teleservices agreement where we purchase payphone and private branch exchange repair and refurbishing and reverse logistics services from sprint nextel 
we have also entered into certain agreements with sprint nextel where we provide certain services to sprint nextel  including calling name database services  toll free rehome services and special access services 
competition there is widespread competition among communications services providers 
the traditional dividing lines between local  long distance  wireless  video and internet services are becoming increasingly blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in regulatory changes that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
competition may adversely impact our revenues and profits in several ways  including losing customers and market share  forcing us to lower prices or increase capital investment or marketing expenses to remain competitive  and increasing our need to incur additional costs in order to diversify our product or service offerings 
the possibility of customers shifting to less profitable data driven services  as an ilec  we increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems constructed by facilities based providers  including cable operators that offer voice over internet protocol  or voip  service  integrated carriers  alternative access vendors  cities and local governments  over builders  clecs and other entities 
some of these systems  which have become more prevalent as a result of the telecom act and recent technological developments  are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of the ilecs networks or switching services 
other providers  including those utilizing non facilities based voip  or nomadic voip  make use of the high speed internet access services that we provide to our customers and may displace the local  long distance  calling features and switched access revenues that we formerly obtained from conventional forms of voice services 
we anticipate that all these trends will continue and will lead to increased competition with our services 
we are facing increasing competition from cable operators who offer voip services that compete with our local and long distance voice services 
as of december   cable voip services were available to approximately of the households in our operating area 
deployment of voip services by cable operators increased significantly in recent years and will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
we intend to actively monitor these developments  to observe the effect of emerging competitive trends in larger markets and to develop appropriate competitive responses 
furthermore  wireless communications services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition for local communications services  especially as wireless carriers expand  begin to offer unlimited calling plans or otherwise reduce their prices and improve their network coverage 
as a result  some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless services 
we anticipate that the trend toward using wireless services will continue 
technological developments in cellular telephone  personal communications services  digital microwave  satellite  broadband radio services  broadband over powerline  local multipoint distribution services  meshed wifi and other wired and wireless technologies permit the further development of alternatives to traditional wireline services 
changes in technology generally result in new entrants into the communications services marketplace 
see risk factors risk factors relating to our business due to competitive  technological and regulatory changes our core business could decline  which could have an adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
additionally  much of the local competition that arose after the passage of the telecom act took the form of the resale of ilec services or the use of ilecs unes  either as a total package of service capabilities generally referred to as the unbundled network element platform  or une p  or in combination with facilities owned by the clec 
we have traditionally been less subject to these forms of competition than larger ilecs serving more urban areas  and recent regulatory decisions have relieved ilecs of the obligation to make une p available to competitors 
however  we continue to offer a local wholesale service to clecs operating in our territory under commercial agreements in place of une p service formerly offered under interconnection agreements 
many of our current and potential competitors have market presence  engineering  technical and marketing capabilities as well as financial  personnel and other resources that are more abundant than ours 
in addition  some of our competitors can conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than we can and are subject to less regulation  taxes or fees 
consequently  some competitors may be able to charge lower prices for their products and services  develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can 
despite the various challenges facing our business  our numerous strengths such as our established customer relationships  existing network architecture  extensive product and service expertise and wide array of bundled offerings  are helping us in our efforts to reduce access line losses 
we intend to continue challenging the competition with innovative bundled offerings that not only respond to but anticipate our customers changing needs  new product offerings  such as continued roll out of high speed internet access and fiber based ethernet services  effective customer care and simplified billing  and attractive and simplified pricing 
legislative and regulatory developments the communications industry has been and remains the subject of legislative and regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels 
the telecom act was the first comprehensive update of the communications act of among other things  the telecom act provided a framework for local competition  but required the implementation of rules by the fcc and the states 
these rules have been the subject of numerous court appeals  as well as lobbying efforts before congress 
in virtually every session of congress since the adoption of the telecom act  legislation has been proposed to amend it 
in addition  members of congress use congressional hearings and letters to emphasize points to regulators 
congressional participation in the development of regulatory policy and enforcement makes the regulatory process less predictable and potentially adverse to our interests 
legislatures and regulatory agencies in the states in which we provide local service also engage in regulatory policymaking that affect our business 
as an ilec  we are subject to pervasive regulation by both state and federal regulatory bodies 
while the amount of regulation is diminishing and we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative polices that will further diminish regulatory burdens imposed on us  we remain subject to more regulation than our competitors 
competition is increasing at a faster rate than regulation is decreasing 
the following summary of the regulatory environment in which our business operates does not describe all present and proposed federal  state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry 
some laws and regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proceedings that could change the manner in which our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or their potential impact on our business 
regulation in the communications industry is subject to change and any change may have an adverse effect on us in the future 
the following discussion describes some of the major communications related regulations that affect us  but numerous other substantive areas of regulation not discussed here may also influence our business 
scope of regulatory environment at the federal level  as an ilec  we are subject to regulation by the fcc and that regulation is generally more extensive than the regulation of our competitors 
this regulation not only covers our rates and service terms  but also affects the terms on which ilecs must provide connections and network elements to competitors 
in contrast  wireless carriers are not regulated from a retail pricing standpoint  but are subject to various licensing and technical requirements imposed by the fcc  including provisions related to the acquisition  assignment or transfer of radio licenses  and mandates  such as enhanced  or e  and wireless local number portability 
long distance carriers  which compete against us and are our customer  are more lightly regulated and are largely detariffed and rate deregulated 
cable operators offer local and long distance voice services  high speed internet and video services in many of our markets  while facing less regulation of these services than we face 
a small but growing category of nomadic voip providers offer services that compete with our wireline offerings also face a lighter regulatory burden 
the fcc has preempted states from exercising entry and related economic regulation of such nomadic voip providers but the fcc has not preempted state regulation of fixed voip service  such as typically offered by cable operators 
with the growing use of voip technologies  the fcc is considering the regulatory status of various forms of voip 
the outcome of these proceedings will determine whether and how retail voip offerings should be regulated  as well as whether voip originated traffic should be afforded different reciprocal compensation or access charge treatment for calls terminated on ilec networks 
specifically  the fcc found that computer to computer voip services that do not involve a retail charge or use conventional telephone numbers  are information services  rather than communications services  effectively deregulating these services 
to date  the fcc has  among other things  directed providers of certain voip services to offer e emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers  applied the requirements of the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea  to certain voip providers  and determined that voip providers are subject to federal universal service assessments see universal service programs 
other issues regarding voip  such as whether voip that interconnects with switched networks qualifies as an information service or a telecommunications service  continue to be the subject of a pending fcc proceeding initiated in march these issues continue to generate interest within the industry as they can affect ilec charges for terminating voip calls and competitive parity among services and service providers 
we cannot be certain whether and when the fcc will further clarify or modify rules governing treatment of voip services 
although the ilec generally has more pervasive regulation by the fcc than other providers  in the fcc agreed to forbear from certain regulations previously applied to our and other ilec s business broadband services 
in granting these forbearance requests  the fcc found that the market for these services provided to larger business customers is competitive and that traditional regulation of ilecs provisions of these services is unwarranted 
the fcc s action allows us and other ilecs greater flexibility to tailor our service offerings to customer needs and competitive market conditions 
several parties have appealed the fcc s grant of forbearance 
the ultimate outcome of such legal challenges of the fcc s orders is uncertain 
additionally  in the fcc declared the high speed internet access services that we and other ilecs provide to be information services  effectively deregulating these services 
this order relieved ilecs of the obligation both to provide the underlying broadband transmission to other isps and to make federal universal service contributions on revenues from high speed internet access services 
this order put ilecs high speed internet access services on an equal regulatory footing with cable modem internet access services 
separately  the fcc ruled that facilities based high speed internet access service providers are subject to calea 
at the state level  ilec local service prices and company earnings were historically regulated based on the cost of providing the service plus a prescribed rate of return 
only three of the states in which we operate washington  oregon  and new jersey  representing less than of our access lines  continue to regulate us in this manner 
in the remaining states  we are regulated under price cap regulation that typically limits our ability to increase rates for local services by a predetermined formula  but generally relieves us from the requirement to meet certain earnings tests 
additionally  in most of the states in which we operate  we have gained pricing flexibility for certain enhanced calling services  such as caller identification  and for bundled services that include local voice service 
in the majority of the states in which we operate  we are able to price bundles of services on an exchange specific basis  instead of on a state wide basis 
most of the states in which we operate impose exacting retail service requirements  which dictate the achievement of certain standards  including call center answer time and intervals for new service installation and service restoration when there are outages 
we are making progress in gaining relief from costly  inflexible  traditional service standards  but many state commissions have been slow to permit ilecs to adopt self enforced  market driven service standards despite the acceleration of competition 
as an ilec  we generally face carrier of last resort  or colr  obligations which include an ongoing requirement to provide service to all who request service and are willing to pay rates prescribed in our tariffs 
in competitively bid situations  such as newly constructed housing developments or multi tenant dwellings  this may constitute a competitive disadvantage to us if competitors can choose to exclusively tie service to homeowner s association fees or choose not to provide service to customers who are poor credit risks or whom they believe would be uneconomic to serve 
strict adherence to colr requirements may force us to construct facilities with a low likelihood of positive economic return 
a few of our states provide relief from colr obligations under certain circumstances  relieving us of the duty to build facilities  typically in developments served by alternative providers with exclusive service arrangements 
additionally  we are seeking regulatory approval in targeted circumstances to deploy service using alternative less costly technologies  such as fixed wireless  and seeking to share the cost of building out the network with those customers 
currently  in certain areas our costs to build and maintain network infrastructure are partially offset by payments from universal service programs 
see federal and state universal service programs below 
federal and state universal service programs federal universal service programs provide funding for services provided in high cost areas  for reduced rate services to low income consumers  and for discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
these programs are funded by contributions from telecommunications carriers 
these contributions are based on an fcc prescribed percentage currently about to of interstate and international revenues and are recovered from customers through surcharges 
historically  this contribution mechanism subjected us to competitive disadvantages but those disadvantages have been largely eliminated by fcc action 
in june  the fcc required voip providers to contribute to the universal service fund based on a fixed percent of their total revenues presumed to be interstate 
in september  the fcc deregulated ilecs high speed internet access service and in the process eliminated the universal service assessments on those services 
the fcc is considering whether to replace the current revenue based assessment for funding universal service in whole or in part with an assessment based on telephone numbers or connections to the public network 
an assessment mechanism based on numbers or network connections could increase our contributions to federal universal service funds  while reducing contributions from long distance service providers 
the size of the federal universal service fund has grown significantly in recent years  primarily due to increased support distributed to competitive carriers including wireless carriers 
in response to this growth  the fcc has initiated several proceedings to investigate reforming the federal universal service fund 
one option under consideration would distribute support through the use of reverse auctions in which carriers would bid for the right to serve a high cost area in exchange for a specified amount of usf support 
other reform proposals have been suggested including altering the distribution of universal service support by targeting it to much smaller geographic areas  therefore tying support more directly to the high cost areas that need support  capping the fund at current levels and replacing the existing usf program with three separate funds supporting wireline  wireless and broadband deployment in rural areas 
in  we received million from federal universal service funds to support our service in high cost areas 
a portion of this support is based on average loop costs 
where our loop costs exceed the nationwide average  which is the case in many of our local service territories  we may receive some federal universal service support 
currently  we receive such support in many of our rural areas 
as our cost structure declines relative to the rising nationwide average loop cost  our receipt of these payments will decrease 
fcc decisions in pending proceedings could affect the amount of high cost support we receive in the future 
until more specific plans are developed by the fcc  we are unable to determine what effect  if any  federal usf reform would have on our universal service receipts or on competition in our markets 
several states in which we operate have established their own universal service programs 
in  embarq received support totaling million from state universal service programs in seven states kansas  nebraska  oregon  pennsylvania  south carolina  texas and wyoming 
several states  including texas  south carolina  pennsylvania and nebraska are currently reviewing their state universal service fund programs  which could lead to a reduction in the support we receive 
intercarrier compensation intercarrier compensation includes regulated interstate and intrastate switched access charges that we  other ilecs  clecs and wireless carriers receive from long distance carriers for the origination and termination of long distance calls and reciprocal compensation that interconnected local carriers pay to each other for terminating interconnected local and wireless calls 
on average  intrastate switched access charges  which are currently regulated by state pucs  are generally higher than interstate switched access charges  which are regulated by the fcc  and in turn interstate switched access charges are generally higher than reciprocal compensation 
switched access for several years  the fcc has been considering intercarrier compensation reform aimed at all forms of intercarrier compensation  ie  interstate and intrastate switched access and reciprocal compensation 
several industry groups have submitted various reform proposals 
embarq joined a group of carriers in proposing a competitive intercarrier compensation reform plan  known in industry circles as the missoula plan 
the missoula plan would reduce the revenues we receive from access charges which would then be recovered through a combination of increased customer surcharges and increased receipts from a fund similar to the federal universal service fund 
the missoula plan also addresses rules to limit so called phantom traffic which are calls that are routed to ilec networks lacking labeling information sufficient to enable ilecs to identify and properly bill the originating carrier for terminating their traffic 
there has been little activity at the fcc on this plan or other intercarrier compensation reform in recent months 
until the fcc s proceeding concludes and changes  if any  to existing rules are implemented  we cannot estimate the impact these changes will have on our operations 
in the absence of comprehensive federal reform  various reform efforts are being considered by some of the states in which we serve 
intrastate access rates have been reduced in recent years in many states pursuant to state approved rate rebalancing programs that lowered access rates while simultaneously increasing basic local rates to offset the displaced access revenues 
other states where intrastate access rates are being reviewed include pennsylvania  virginia  and minnesota 
further efforts to reduce state access rates or to shift recovery of access revenue to local rates could take place as part of comprehensive reform of the intercarrier compensation system  impacting both state and federal rates  referenced above 
however  competitive market forces may limit the amount of revenue recoverable from basic local rate increases 
accordingly  there may be limited opportunity to fully rebalance or offset future intrastate access rate reductions  with corresponding increases to basic local rates 
special access in november  the fcc solicited public comment on the state of the special access market and whether pricing flexibility policies should be revised 
the fcc is considering whether reforms may be warranted to modify or eliminate pricing flexibility policies and the price cap rules governing special access pricing 
the outcome of the fcc s proceeding is uncertain  but could result in significant changes to the way in which we receive compensation from other carriers and our end users for special access services 
it is unclear whether the fcc will make any policy changes affecting current special access pricing rules or  if so  whether and to what extent any changes will affect our special access revenues 
environmental compliance seven former manufactured gas plant sites have been identified that may have been owned or operated by entities acquired by our subsidiary  centel corporation centel  before that company was acquired by sprint nextel 
these sites are not currently owned or operated by either sprint nextel or us 
on three sites  we and the current landowners are working with the environmental protection agency  or epa  pursuant to administrative consent orders 
expenditures pursuant to the orders are not expected to be material 
on five sites  including the three sites where the epa is involved  centel has entered into agreements with other potentially responsible parties to share costs 
further  sprint nextel has agreed to indemnify us for most of any eventual liability arising from all seven of these sites 
other environmental compliance and remediation expenditures mainly result from the operation of uninterrupted power supplies for our communications equipment 
the expenditures arise in connection with standards compliance  permits or occasional remediation  and are usually related to generators  batteries or fuel storage 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that future environmental compliance and remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information on our environmental obligations  see note  background  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  and note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
patents  trademarks and licenses we own several patents  patent applications  service marks and trademarks in the us we have filed for trademarks  service marks and patents where we believe this protection is appropriate including our embarq brand trademark 
our services often use the intellectual property of others such as using licensed software 
we also license or otherwise obtain rights to use copyrights  patents and trademarks of others 
in total  these licenses  rights to use and our copyrights  patents  trademarks and service marks are of material importance to our business 
generally  our trademarks  trademark licenses and service marks have no limitation on duration 
we occasionally licenses our intellectual property to others and have granted licenses to others to use our registered trademark embarq tm in certain situations  including to rh donnelley in connection with the publishing of telephone directories in our local service territories 
we have received claims in the past  and may in the future receive claims  that we infringe on the intellectual property of others 
these claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources 
if these claims are successful  we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or utilizing certain service marks or trademarks 
we also could enter into licenses with unfavorable terms  including royalty payments  which could adversely affect our business 
seasonality overall  our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality 
however  in our florida markets  we typically experience increased demand for new service orders in the late fall months and a decline in access lines in the early spring months due to the seasonal population trends in the state 
additionally  weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our service areas 
the amount and timing of the costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year  but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms  including wind damage and flooding  hurricanes and tornadoes in our local service territories in florida  north carolina  south carolina and texas 
employees as of december   we had approximately thousand active employees 
approximately of these employees were represented by unions subject to collective bargaining agreements 
of the union represented employees  approximately had collective bargaining agreements that will expire within one year 
there have been no material changes to these collective bargaining agreements 
item a 
risk factors risk factors relating to our business we face widespread competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
we face significant competition from a number of different types of communications services providers  including cable and other companies offering voip  integrated communication service providers  wireless communications service providers  alternative access vendors  cities and local governments  over builders  clecs  and isps 
we face increasing competition from cable operators and other service providers offering high speed internet and voip services 
as voip becomes a more robust and widely available service and operators continue to add more features and functionality  existing competitors could become more formidable and new competitors could enter our markets 
we also face increasing competition from wireless communications service providers 
as wireless carriers continue to expand  begin offering unlimited calling plans or otherwise reduce their prices and improve their network coverage  some customers choose to stop using traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service 
we anticipate that this trend will continue and could negatively impact our wireline revenues and our current wireless offerings 
technological developments in cellular telephone  personal communications services  digital microwave  satellite  broadband radio services  local multipoint distribution services  meshed wireless fidelity  or wifi  and other wireless technologies are expected to permit the further development of alternatives to traditional wireline communications services 
many of our current and potential competitors have market presence  engineering  technical and marketing capabilities as well as financial  personnel and other resources more abundant than ours 
mergers or other combinations involving our competitors may increase this risk factor 
in addition  some of our competitors can conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than we can and are subject to less regulation  taxes or fees 
consequently  some competitors are able to charge lower prices for their products and services  to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can 
competition may adversely impact our revenues and profits in several ways  including losing customers and market share  forcing us to lower prices or increase capital investment or marketing expenses to remain competitive  and increasing our need to incur additional costs to diversify by offering new products or services 
furthermore  customers could adversely impact revenues and profits by shifting to less profitable data driven services 
we face increased competition from companies offering integrated communication services 
the traditional dividing lines between providers of local and long distance telephone services and wireless  video  internet and cable television services are increasingly becoming blurred  in part because of changes in the regulatory environment that have facilitated the offering of integrated services 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  providers of competing communication services are increasingly able to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
integrating services provided by another entity eg  satellite video presents unique challenges in terms of coordinating offer strategies and account logistics 
however  if we don t offer integrated service offerings  we may not be successful against competitors who do 
new technologies may be developed that could displace our service offerings 
we expect competition to intensify as new technologies  products and services are developed 
changes in technology may permit new entrants into the communications services marketplace  and as a result the future prospects of the incumbent wireline industry and the success of our services remain uncertain 
we cannot predict with certainty which of many possible future technologies  products or services will be important for us to develop in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to technology driven changes in our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue and earnings or profits 
our industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo various regulatory and legislative changes  which could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations 
as an ilec  we have traditionally been and continue to be subject to significant regulation from federal  state and local governments and in many respects are subject to more extensive regulation than our competitors 
this regulation imposes substantial compliance costs on us  and often restricts our ability to adjust rates to reflect market conditions and impacts our ability to compete and respond to changing industry conditions 
in recent years  the communications industry has undergone various fundamental regulatory changes that have generally permitted competition in each segment of the telephone industry  while also permitting  in more limited respects  reduced regulation of ilecs 
congress and state legislatures may enact laws  and the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
proposals in congress and at the fcc that would regulate the manner in which providers of high speed internet service may manage their networks or utilize data from their customers could affect our ability to manage our network and market ip based value added services to our customers 
these proposals are sometimes referred to as internet regulation or net neutrality proposals 
it is uncertain whether any such regulations will be adopted or enforcement actions taken  and if so  what impact they may have on our business 
fcc regulations require service providers to maintain safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of customer proprietary network information  or cpni  which were recently revised to require additional security procedures that required modifications to our practices 
additional proposed cpni rules are pending consideration at the fcc that could require further modification of our use and protection of this data 
additionally  the federal trade commission is considering principles governing on line behavioral marketing and consumer privacy 
it is uncertain whether any new regulations or enforcement actions will be undertaken  and if so  what impact they may have on our business 
there are also regulatory uncertainties regarding the appropriate level of compensation we receive from other carriers for calls they receive from our network or hand off to our network 
there is regulatory uncertainty surrounding the rules governing the appropriate level of compensation voip providers pay to exchange traffic with us  which may adversely affect our access revenues and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
there is a proceeding pending at the fcc on the pricing of special access services  which also creates uncertainty regarding the rates we charge for those services in the future 
some states are reviewing their rules regarding the appropriateness of current intrastate switched access rates  which could adversely affect us by requiring a reduction in those rates 
although there has been little recent activity  the fcc is considering comprehensive reform of all the rules governing intercarrier compensation  which could resolve some of these uncertainties but could also serve to reduce our revenues unless the plan provides a feasible mechanism to replace those revenues with revenues from other sources 
various legislative and regulatory proposals are also pending on the state and federal level that could substantially alter universal service support mechanisms  which could reduce our usf revenue and adversely affect our ability to fund the provision of services in high cost rural markets at affordable rates 
at the federal level  these proposals include changes in the method of calculating usf contributions  reverse auctions where carriers would bid for the right to receive usf support  broadband mandates and other fundamental structural changes to the program 
several of the states in which we operate are also considering changes to their usf programs 
other pending rule changes could also have a substantial impact on our operations  including  in particular  rule changes on intercarrier compensation and universal service 
litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay our ability to respond to new regulations 
moreover  changes in tax laws  regulations or policies could increase our tax rate 
we are unable to predict the future actions of congress  state legislatures and the various regulatory bodies that govern us  but those actions could materially affect our business 
due to competitive  technological and regulatory changes our core business could decline  which could have an adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
due to the competitive  technological and regulatory changes described above  the local communications industry has recently experienced a decline in access lines  interstate and intrastate access traffic and long distance traffic 
the recent decline in access lines and usage  coupled with the other changes resulting from competitive  technological and regulatory developments  could materially adversely affect our core business and future prospects 
we anticipate that expected increases in our data revenue could be more than offset by continued declines in revenues from traditional voice services 
our access lines declined in and in we expect access line losses to continue due to competition and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the need to raise additional capital may adversely affect holders of our common stock by increasing our leverage and reducing our credit ratings 
we may need to incur additional debt or issue securities to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and product development requirements or to make acquisitions and other investments 
due to limitations in our tax sharing agreement with sprint nextel  for specified periods of up to months following the spin off  any additional capital we seek to raise may have to be in the form of debt  which could increase our leverage and reduce our credit ratings 
further  any debt securities or preferred stock we issue will have liquidation rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of common equity  ownership interest will be diluted  and we may lower the per share amount of any dividends 
a significant portion of our workforce is unionized  and if we are unable to reach new agreements before our current labor contracts expire  our unionized workers could engage in strikes or other labor actions that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services to our customers 
as of december   we had approximately thousand active employees 
approximately of these employees were represented by unions subject to collective bargaining agreements 
of the union represented employees  approximately had collective bargaining agreements that will expire in we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations and may be unable to reach new agreements  and union employees may engage in strikes  work slowdowns or other labor actions  which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services 
new labor agreements may impose significant new costs on us  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
we face hurricane and other natural disaster risks  which can disrupt our operations and cause us to incur substantial additional capital costs 
approximately of our access lines are located in florida  north carolina  south carolina and texas  and our operations there are subject to the many hazards inherent in being located in areas frequently hit by severe storms  hurricanes and tornadoes  including downed telephone lines  power outages  damaged or destroyed property and equipment  and work interruptions 
although we maintain property and casualty insurance and may under certain circumstances be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates  only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such hurricanes and natural disasters have historically been recoverable 
we cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to obtain insurance for hurricane related damages or  if obtainable and carried  whether this insurance will be adequate to cover our losses 
in addition  we expect any insurance of this nature to be subject to substantial deductibles and to provide for premium adjustments based on claims 
any future hurricane related costs and work interruptions could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness  which could restrict our ability to pay dividends and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity 
the extent to which we are leveraged could limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all  require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to paying the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes  prevent or make it more difficult for us to pay our anticipated cash dividends on our common stock and remain in compliance with the term of our indebtedness  and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures 
our financing arrangements subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility 
our credit agreement and other financing arrangements contain covenants and other restrictions that  among other things  require us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  both the indenture governing our senior notes and our credit agreement restrict our ability to create liens  which could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
the restrictions and covenants in our financing arrangements  and in future financing arrangements  may limit our ability to respond to market conditions  provide for capital investment needs  or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
we may not have access to capital on acceptable terms  and if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing  we may be unable to maintain or grow our business 
since the spin off  our credit ratings from each of the major rating agencies have remained at the lower end of investment grade 
credit ratings affect the interest rate charged on financings  as well as the amounts of indebtedness and types of financing structures that may be available to us 
regulatory restrictions and the terms of our indebtedness limit our ability to raise capital through our subsidiaries  pledge the stock of our subsidiaries  encumber the assets of our subsidiaries and cause our subsidiaries to guarantee our indebtedness 
we may not be able to raise the capital we require on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing  we may be unable to maintain or grow our business 
further  issuances of equity securities are subject to limitations imposed on us in the tax sharing agreement 
risk factors relating to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risk factors listed in this report or for reasons not specifically related to our performance  such as industry or market trends  reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions  or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
for example  to the extent that other companies within our industry experience declines in their stock price  our stock price may decline as well 
anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  the terms of our spin off from sprint nextel  including several of our agreements with sprint nextel  and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
provisions included in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  among other things  include limiting the right of stockholders to call meetings of stockholders  regulating how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders  requiring any business combination initiated by a stockholder of or more of our common stock to be approved by the holders of at least of our common stock  and authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without stockholder approval 
an acquisition or further issuance of our equity securities could cause our spin off from sprint nextel to be taxable to sprint nextel  requiring us under the tax sharing agreement to indemnify sprint nextel for the resulting tax 
moreover  under the tax sharing agreement  we are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions involving our stock for specified periods of up to months following the spin off  except in specified circumstances 
this indemnity obligation and related provisions under the tax sharing agreement might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable 
in addition  several of the agreements that we have entered into with sprint nextel  including certain commercial service agreements  require sprint nextel s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements and may also be terminated upon a change of control of our company 
the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable 
risk relating to the spin off from sprint nextel our future financial performance may be worse than the performance reflected in our historical financial information 
for the periods prior to spin off  the historical financial information included in this annual report does not reflect what our results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent company during the entire periods presented 
this is primarily a result of the following our historical financial information for the periods prior to spin off reflects allocations for services historically provided by sprint nextel 
these allocations are different from the costs and do not reflect the increased costs associated with being an independent company  including changes in our cost structure  personnel needs  financing and operations of the business and from reduced economies of scale  and our historical financial information for periods prior to spin off does not reflect the debt and related interest expense that was incurred as part of the spin off 
see note  long term debt and financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
for additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated financial statements see item  selected financial data  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
before our spin off from sprint nextel  our business was principally operated as one of sprint nextel s business units  and therefore we have only a brief operating history as an independent public company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our business strategy and operations will be successful on a stand alone basis 
our profitability may be adversely affected when charges cease for certain support functions that we provide to sprint nextel on a transitional basis following the spin off 
following the spin off  we will continue to provide support to sprint nextel with respect to certain functions on a transitional basis for up to two years 
among the principal services that we provide to sprint nextel are billing support services  field technician support for complex voice customers and information technology application services 
amounts paid by sprint nextel for these services were million during  and are expected to be approximately million during upon expiration of these transitional arrangements  we will need to replace such amounts with new revenue sources or otherwise reduce our cost structure appropriately or our profitability will suffer 
we could incur a significant liability if the distribution of embarq common stock in the spin off is determined to be a taxable transaction 
if the distribution does not qualify as a tax free transaction  tax could be imposed on sprint nextel and we may be required to indemnify sprint nextel for such tax 
on july   sprint nextel received a private letter ruling from the irs that the spin off qualifies for tax free treatment under code sections and in addition  sprint nextel obtained an opinion of counsel from each of cravath  swaine moore llp and paul  weiss  rifkind  wharton garrison llp that the spin off so qualified 
such opinions primarily addressed those tax matters upon which the irs customarily declines to rule 
notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and the opinions  the irs could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated and or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the irs ruling 
if the spin off failed to qualify for tax free treatment  it will be treated as a taxable dividend to sprint nextel stockholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock issued to sprint nextel holders and sprint nextel would be required to recognize taxable gain in an amount up to the fair market value of our common stock that sprint nextel distributed to its stockholders in the spin off plus the fair market value of the senior notes that sprint nextel received from us 
furthermore  events after the spin off could cause sprint nextel to recognize such gain even if the spin off otherwise would have qualified for tax free treatment 
for example  under code section e  relatively small acquisitions of either our equity securities or sprint nextel s equity securities that are deemed to be part of a plan or a series of related transactions that include the spin off could cause sprint nextel to recognize gain on the spin off 
under the tax sharing agreement between sprint nextel and us  we are generally required to indemnify sprint nextel against any tax resulting from the spin off if such tax results from an issuance of our equity securities  a redemption of our equity securities or our involvement in other acquisitions of our equity securities  other actions or failures to act by us or any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated 
we estimate that if any of these conditions occur the indemnification obligation to sprint nextel for taxes would be significant and we are unlikely to have the ability to pay that obligation 
we agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the tax free treatment of our spin off from sprint nextel  which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility 
under the tax sharing agreement  in order to preserve the tax free treatment to sprint nextel of the spin off  for specified periods of up to months following the spin off  embarq may be prohibited  except in specified circumstances  from issuing  redeeming or being involved in other acquisitions of our equity securities  transferring significant amounts of our assets  amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  failing to comply with the irs requirement for a spin off that we engage in the active conduct of a trade or business after the spin off  or engaging in other actions or transactions that could jeopardize the tax free status of the spin off 
a private letter ruling issued by the irs after the spin off provides us with the flexibility to pursue open market repurchases of our common stock without adversely affecting the tax free status of our spin off from sprint nextel 
these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business 
see our relationship with sprint nextel tax sharing agreement in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
the agreements that we entered into with sprint nextel may involve  or may appear to involve  conflicts of interest 
we entered into certain agreements with sprint nextel to provide a framework for our initial relationship with sprint nextel following the spin off 
we negotiated these agreements with sprint nextel while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of sprint nextel 
accordingly  our executive officers and some of our directors were employees  officers or directors of sprint nextel or its subsidiaries at the time of the negotiations and  as such  had an obligation to serve the interests of sprint nextel and its subsidiaries 
as a result  they could be viewed as having had a conflict of interest 
we do not benefit from the economics of ownership associated with the network infrastructure to support our long distance and other video entertainment offerings 
additionally  we do not own or have a license to all technology that may be necessary to expand our product offerings 
both of these could adversely affect our business and profitability 
we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents from sprint nextel or third parties to be able to offer new products and services 
we have the right to use all of sprint nextel s existing patents for a five year period after the spin off  however  we do have the right to use the sprint nextel patents for business that we were conducting as of the spin off for the life of those patents 
if we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from sprint nextel following that five year period or from a third party on reasonable terms  our ability to offer new ip based products and services  including voip  or other new offerings may be restricted  made more costly or delayed 
our inability to implement ip based or other new offerings on a cost effective basis could impair our ability to successfully meet increasing competition from companies offering integrated communications services  including cable operators and other service providers offering high speed internet services that can be used as a platform to support voice services utilizing voip 
our inability to deploy new technologies could also prevent us from successfully diversifying  modifying or bundling our service offerings and result in accelerated loss of access lines  customer usage and revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business and profitability 
restrictions in the patent agreement entered into with sprint nextel could adversely affect our ability to grow through acquisitions  be acquired or make divestitures 
following the spin off  if we grow by acquisitions to become more than twice our size as of the spin off date  any new companies that we acquire  or operations that are integrated with new acquisitions  will not have the benefit of the patent agreement with sprint nextel 
also  if we undergo a change in control and there is a functional integration of our operations with a third party we will lose the benefits of some or all of the patents governed by the patent agreement with sprint nextel 
the benefits of that agreement do not extend to any parent company or any companies under common control with us 
these limitations may make us less attractive as an acquisition candidate and reduce the value that an acquirer would be willing to pay for our business 
divestitures of our assets and operations could also be restricted because the benefits of the agreement would continue to apply only if divested operations or assets are isolated from the other members of the corporate group making the acquisition and only if the business is conducted in substantially the same manner and in substantially the same geographic area that it was conducted before the divestiture 
these limitations may make our assets less attractive to a potential acquirer and could reduce the value that an acquirer would be willing to pay for the assets

overview operations we provide  both directly and through wholesale and sales agency relationships  a suite of communications services  consisting of local and long distance voice  data  high speed internet  satellite video  wireless and other communications related products and services to consumer and business customers primarily in our local service territories in states 
we also provide access to our local network and wholesale communications services for customers  including other carriers 
through our logistics segment  we engage in wholesale product distribution  logistics and configuration services 
our consumer and business strategy is to maximize profitable communications services revenue per customer by providing bundled and integrated products and services that meet the needs of our consumer and business customers within our local territories 
this strategy has four key elements provide useful products and solutions to attract and retain customers by marketing integrated service offerings  improve the customer experience and perception of service and product offerings  manage our costs and maintain a customer focused culture that promotes high performance and employee satisfaction 
our wholesale business strategy is structured around increasing the utilization and achieved return of our core network investment by providing a full set of wholesale services to other carriers and wireless providers 
services offered include switched access  special access  intelligent network database  collocation  resale  unbundled network element platforms  high speed data services and billing and collection services 
in addition  we offer public pay telephone services along with services to inmates in numerous correctional institutions both inside and outside our traditional local service territories 
we have continued to experience declines in the number of switched access lines we serve 
the following table reflects the losses in switched access lines by year as of december  difference amount thousands primary additional total consumer business wholesale total as of december  difference amount thousands primary additional total consumer business wholesale total consumer switched access line losses represent the most significant portion of our losses 
the primary driver of these losses has been the increasing overlap of cable operators within our local service territories offering voip services 
as of december   approximately of our local service territories face competition from cable providers for voice services 
this compares to approximately as of december   and approximately as of december  consumer losses can also be attributed to an increasing number of customers choosing to discontinue traditional wireline phone service to rely solely on wireless services and  to a lesser extent  growth of other facilities based or non facilities based providers 
product substitution among our offerings also contributes to our access line losses 
certain additional consumer access lines have been replaced with our high speed internet service and certain of our business access line losses result from the conversion to our data services 
these substitutions result in a reduction in the number of switched access lines we serve  however  do not represent a loss of the customer relationship 
we expect that these access line loss trends will continue or be slightly higher into growth in other services that we generally provide on a bundled basis such as high speed internet  various data services  wireless and video have continued to offset a substantial portion of the revenue declines associated with the access line losses discussed above 
in  we increased our high speed internet subscriber base by ending the year with approximately million subscribers 
simplified and more attractive pricing plans have continued to be successful 
additionally  in  we launched myembarq 
com  a new embarq tm branded web portal  which offers a variety of enhanced services for our high speed internet subscribers  such as e mail with unlimited storage  music and video downloads  commercial free radio  discounted access to popular web sites  news  games  and other content 
in addition to enhancing our subscribers high speed internet experience  this portal provides us with additional revenue generating opportunities  through content downloads  web advertisements and other website partner arrangements 
demand for data services has also continued to be strong 
our data services consist mainly of dedicated circuits connecting another carrier s network to their customer s locations  wireless carrier s cell towers to mobile switching stations  or business customers to our network 
revenues associated with these services increased in in the second quarter of  we launched embarq branded wireless service 
we provide this service through a mvno relationship with sprint nextel 
as of december   we had thousand wireless subscribers  compared to thousand a year ago 
our wireless service has been and continues to be dilutive to our results of operations  but we have and continue to take the actions necessary to improve these results 
in late  we began to take steps to minimize dilution  such as modifying our offerings and credit policies to more selectively target customers and reducing related advertising and promotional expenses 
in  we have continued to evaluate our approach to optimize the performance of our wireless business 
in connection with that evaluation  we will take certain steps to accomplish an orderly transition away from our current approach to our mvno arrangement and will further evaluate our wireless service offerings 
video service is also a growing element of our bundled service offers 
we currently offer video and pay per view service through sales agency relationships with various satellite providers 
as of december   we had thousand video service subscribers  compared to thousand as of december  to measure our success in our bundling initiatives as well as attracting and retaining high value customers  average monthly revenue per household arph is a measure that we closely monitor 
this measure is calculated by dividing one twelfth of annual consumer revenue by average primary access lines 
difference amount annual consumer revenue millions average primary access lines thousands arph approximately one half of the improvement in arph is attributable to our success in developing and selling bundled offers  which we believe increases customer satisfaction and loyalty to embarq 
the remaining improvement results from a full year s impact of long distance customers transferred from sprint nextel at spin off 
spin off from sprint nextel in december  sprint nextel announced its intention to spin off their local communications business and product distribution operations from their other businesses in a tax free transaction 
on may   the date of the spin off  in exchange for  and as a condition to  the transfer of assets and the assumption of liabilities described below  we issued to sprint nextel million shares of our common stock and issued to sprint nextel billion of embarq senior notes and transferred to sprint nextel billion in cash 
in exchange for  and contemporaneously with  the issuance of our common stock and transfer of debt and cash  sprint nextel transferred the embarq assets  at historical cost  consisting of sprint nextel s local communications operations  wholesale product distribution operations and the consumer and certain business long distance customers located in our service territories  and we assumed certain liabilities related to our business 
the spin off was completed through a pro rata distribution to sprint nextel shareholders consisting of one share of our common stock for every shares of sprint nextel voting and non voting shares owned by sprint nextel s shareholders as of the close of business on may   the record date for the distribution 
sprint nextel historically performed many important functions for our operations  including information technology support  treasury  accounting  finance and tax administration  human resources  legal  regulatory  public relations and strategic development functions 
see note  spin off from sprint nextel  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional related party transaction information 
since the spin off  sprint nextel has provided support to us with respect to certain of these functions on a transitional basis and will continue to provide some of these services for up to two years following the spin off 
as such  we are required to replicate certain facilities  systems  infrastructure and personnel before the termination of these agreements with sprint nextel 
on a cumulative basis  through december   capital expenditures and other costs associated with developing and implementing our own support functions  including information technology systems and infrastructure have totaled approximately million 
the total spin off related charges and capital expenditures were as follows for the years ended december  millions spin off related charges spin off related capital expenditures approximately million of the spin off related capital expenditures were incurred by sprint nextel on our behalf before the spin off 
the resulting property  plant and equipment were transferred to us at spin off 
accordingly  these capital expenditures are not reflected in our reported capital expenditures in on an ongoing basis  we do not expect to incur significant amounts of spin off related costs 
industry environment we operate in an industry that has been and continues to be subject to intense competition and regulatory and legislative change 
given these factors  as well as the trend toward consolidation in the industry  we routinely assess the implications of these industry factors on our operations 
these assessments  along with regulatory and legislative developments  may impact the future valuation of our long lived assets and could have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to understand our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies 
these policies are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and because they require judgments and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events that are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition policies total net operating revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from voice  data  high speed internet  wireless service and product sales 
we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are sold in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
certain service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized over the average life of the customer 
in addition  revenue with multiple deliverables is recorded in compliance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we also record revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
net operating revenues include certain revenue reserves for access disputes with clecs  wireless and long distance carriers  billing errors and customer disputes  and returns on product sales 
selling  general and administrative expense includes charges for estimated bad debt expense 
these reserves require management s judgment and are based on many factors including historical trending and industry norms and current economic environment 
if the revenue reserve as a percentage of our net operating revenues were to be increased by basis points  our net operating revenues would be reduced by million for and million for as of december  and  if the accounts receivable reserve estimates as a percentage of accounts receivable were increased by  bad debt expense would increase approximately million for each period 
management believes the reserve estimate selected  in each instance  represents its best estimate of future outcomes  but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimate selected 
property  plant and equipment pp e and intangibles pp e and intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment arise 
accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present  we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest costs  expected to result from the asset 
an impairment is recognized based on the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount is in excess of the recoverable amount 
in estimating future cash flows  we use our internal business forecasts 
we develop our forecasts based on recent data for existing products and services  planned timing of new products and services  and other industry and economic factors 
during the fourth quarter of  sprint nextel terminated development and deployment of a network monitoring software application resulting in approximately million in allocated asset impairment charges to our business 
depreciable lives of assets estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability of our long lived assets 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
we perform annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciation rates for each group of assets 
these studies utilize models  which take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  assumptions about technology evolution and in certain instances actuarially determined probabilities to calculate remaining lives of our asset base 
if our studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by the following for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  millions depreciation rate sensitivity income taxes current income tax expense represents the amount of income taxes paid or currently payable to various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in the current provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the interpretations of tax regulations  the tax class life assigned to assets  and the timing of deferred tax asset and liability realization 
the amount of income taxes we ultimately pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state taxing authorities 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issues is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
the consolidated financial statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes 
management must assess the expected realizable future tax benefits of deferred tax assets and record any required valuation allowances 
our valuation allowance was million as of december   and million as of december  the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryovers 
actual income taxes could vary from estimates due to changes in income tax laws  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
employee benefit plan assumptions retirement benefits are significant costs of doing business yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of the future benefit costs over the employee s expected tenure with us based on the terms of the benefit plans and the related investment and funding decisions 
the accounting standards require that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets  the discount rate and future health care costs 
these assumptions are subject to changing market conditions 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost incurred 
in selecting our discount rate  a hypothetical portfolio of bonds rated aa or better that produces a cash flow matching the projected benefit payments of the plan was constructed 
for the december   measurement date  this exercise produced a discount rate of  a basis point increase from the rate determined at december  if the discount rates used in determining the december   projected benefit obligation and benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans were basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the projected benefit obligation and a million increase in benefit costs 
the long term expected return on plan assets was determined by considering forward looking estimates of the expected long term returns for a portfolio invested according to the pension trust s target investment policy 
if the assumption regarding the expected long term return on plan assets for of were basis points lower  our pension expense for would have been million higher 
in determining postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations  assumptions are made concerning the cost of health care  including medical inflation and discount rates 
a basis point increase in the assumed medical inflation rate would generate a million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in benefit costs in if the discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the obligation as of december   and would have had an immaterial impact on benefit costs 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as prescribed by the interpretation  the cumulative effect of applying these provisions was reported as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings 
we record interest associated with these liabilities as interest expense 
associated penalties are recorded as income tax expense

significant new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 fair value measurements this standard provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities on the balance sheet by clarifying the definition of fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for fiscal years beginning after november   for assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured on a recurring basis

the reserve for bad debt requires management s judgment and is based on many factors

these costs decreased million in and million in the drivers of these changes are directly associated with the revenue factors noted above  as well as a reduction of inventory reserves related to previously exited markets and a third quarter charge associated with certain in process inventory 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense decreased million in and million in the decrease in costs was driven by a decrease in spin off costs  a decrease in severance charges as well as favorable bad debt experience 
the comparison benefited from reductions in workforce associated with the exit of the unprofitable enterprise and wireless markets initiated in late and completed in  and the integration of certain support functions with those established by us at spin off 
these benefits were somewhat offset by severance charges and spin off costs attributed to the logistics business 
consolidated non operating items for the years ended december  millions interest expense other income expense  net income tax expense cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  net interest expense interest expense increased million in and million in these increases are primarily due to the full year impact of the issuance of the long term debt associated with spin off partially offset by the reduction of debt outstanding and elimination of notes previously payable to sprint nextel 
our effective interest rate on long term debt was for and for the slightly higher effective interest rate is primarily due to the pay down of spin off related debt bearing lower effective interest rates
