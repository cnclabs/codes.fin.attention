company overview union drilling  inc provides contract land drilling services and equipment  primarily to natural gas producers in the united states 
in addition to our drilling rigs  we provide the drilling crews and most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs 
we commenced operations in with drilling rigs and related equipment acquired from an entity providing contract drilling services under the name union drilling 
through a combination of acquisitions and new rig construction  we have increased the size of our fleet to marketed land drilling rigs 
we presently focus our operations in selected natural gas production regions in the united states  primarily the fort worth basin in north texas  the arkoma basin in oklahoma and arkansas and throughout the appalachian basin 
we do not invest in oil and natural gas properties 
we completed several transactions in  and that enhanced our ability to serve our markets 
these transactions provided us with unconventional natural gas contract drilling operations in north texas and the arkoma basin 
in april  we acquired thornton drilling company  which owned a fleet of rigs and leased an additional rig operating in the arkoma basin  and we acquired eight rigs from spa drilling lp  five of which are targeting the barnett shale formation in the fort worth basin 
in june and august  we acquired a total of six more rigs  five of which target the barnett shale formation in the fort worth basin 
during and  we purchased new and newly constructed rigs and have devoted significant capital expenditures to upgrade other rigs in our fleet for underbalanced and horizontal drilling 
these investments have positioned our fleet to capitalize on our customers rapidly growing unconventional formation exploration and development activity 
key indicators of financial performance for management significant performance measurements in our industry are rig utilization  revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day 
revenue days for each rig are days when the rig is earning revenues under a contract  which is usually a period from the date the rig begins moving to the drilling location until the rig is released from the contract 
we compute rig utilization rates by dividing revenue days by total available days during a period 
total available days are the number of calendar days during the period that we have owned the rig 

table of contents the following table summarizes management s key indicators of financial performance for the three years ended december  years ended december  revenue days during period average number of marketed rigs marketed rig utilization rates revenue per revenue day operating expenses per revenue day utilization and revenue days during were negatively impacted by a significant decline in the demand for smaller rigs in our fleet  the transition of our rocky mountain rigs to the fayetteville shale  which was completed at the end of the second quarter of  and an increase in the number of rigs available in the market 
the reasons for the increase in the number of revenue days in over are the increase in size of our rig fleet and the improvement in our overall rig utilization rate due to improved market conditions 
a significant factor contributing to the growth in the number of rigs and revenue days was the aforementioned and acquisitions 
we devote substantial resources to maintaining and upgrading our rig fleet 
on a regular basis  we remove certain rigs from service to perform upgrades 
in the short term  these actions result in fewer revenue days and slightly lower utilization  however  in the long term  we believe the upgrades will help the marketability of the rigs and improve their operating performance 
we are currently performing or have recently performed  between contracts or as necessary  safety and equipment upgrades to various rigs in our fleet 
the increase in revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day in compared to was primarily related to the six new rigs placed into service in late and early due to their greater capacity  these new rigs earn a higher dayrate and incur more operating expenses than older rigs in our fleet 
market conditions in our industry the us contract land drilling services industry is highly volatile 
volatility in oil and gas prices can produce wide swings in the levels of overall drilling activity in the markets we serve and affect the demand for our drilling services and the rates we can charge for our rigs 
the availability of financing sources  past trends in oil and gas prices and the outlook for future oil and gas prices strongly influence the number of wells exploration and production companies decide to drill 
see item business and item a 
risk factors 
during fiscal  and  substantially all the wells we drilled for our customers were drilled in search of natural gas because of the depth capacity of our rigs and the natural gas rich areas in which we operate 
our customers are primarily focused on drilling for natural gas 
natural gas reserves are typically found in deeper geological formations and generally require premium equipment and quality crews to drill the wells 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue and cost recognition 
we generate revenue principally by drilling wells for natural gas producers on a contracted basis under daywork or footage contracts  which provide for the drilling of single or multiple well projects 
revenues on daywork contracts are recognized based on the days worked at the dayrate each contract specifies 
mobilization fees are recognized as the related drilling services are provided 
we recognize revenues on footage contracts based on the footage drilled for the applicable accounting period 
expenses are recognized based on the costs incurred during that same accounting period 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers based on their financial information  if available  information obtained from major industry suppliers  and our past experiences with the customer 
in some instances  we require new customers to establish escrow accounts or make prepayments 
we typically invoice our customers periodically during the performance of daywork contracts and upon completion of the daywork contract 
footage contracts are invoiced upon completion of the contract 
our contracts generally provide for payment of invoices in days 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  at december  and  at december   respectively 
any allowance established is subject to judgment and estimates made by management 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the 
table of contents length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  our assessment of our customers current abilities to pay obligations to us and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable  of which million was for one customer 
during  we wrote off  of accounts receivable 
at december  and  our contract drilling work in progress totaled approximately million and million  respectively  all of which relates to the revenue recognized  but not yet billed  on daywork and footage contracts in progress at december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to an increase in progress billings 
in addition  unbilled receivables as of december  and include a reserve for sales credits of approximately  and  respectively 
asset impairments and depreciation 
we assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review would be any significant negative trends in the industry or the general economy  our contract revenue rates  our rig utilization rates  cash flows from our drilling rigs  current oil and natural gas prices  industry analysts outlook for the industry and their view of our customers access to capital and the trends in the price of used drilling equipment observed by our management 
if a review of our drilling rigs indicates that our carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we are required under applicable accounting standards to write down the drilling equipment to its fair market value 
we provide for depreciation of our drilling rigs  transportation and other equipment on a straight line method over useful lives that we have estimated and that range from two to years after the rig was placed into service 
unlike depreciation based on units of production  our approach to depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle or when utilization changes 
we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis despite the fact that our revenues and operating costs may vary with changes in utilization levels 
our estimates of the useful lives of our drilling  transportation and other equipment are based on our experience in the drilling industry with similar equipment 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchase of thornton drilling company in april see note of notes to financial statements included in
