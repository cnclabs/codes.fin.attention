quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments in marketable securities during the normal course of business  we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities 
for a discussion of our investments in marketable securities for the fiscal years ended december   and december   see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report  included herein as exhibit  and incorporated herein by reference 
financial contracts and market risk we conduct business on a global basis in us and foreign currencies  so our financial results are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we have a foreign currency exposure management program  which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
we enter into derivative foreign exchange contracts only to the extent necessary to meet our goal of mitigating nonfunctional foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
the derivative foreign exchange contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
derivative financial contracts involve elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the financial statements 
the market risk that results from these contracts relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which generally are offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large international financial institutions 
we monitor the counterparties credit ratings and other market data to minimize our credit risk 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate notional amount of agreements entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk 
non designated hedges we use derivative contracts to manage overall foreign currency exposures that are remeasured through income 
we record these contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are included in earnings as part of other expense  net 
we had a net gain of million in  a net gain of million in and a net loss of million in receivables resulting from the contracts are included in miscellaneous receivables and other current assets  while payables from the contracts are included as part of other accrued liabilities 
we do not engage in hedging specific individual transactions 
cash flow hedges we use derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate currency risk related to an imbalance of nonfunctional currency denominated costs and related revenue 
we conducted monthly effectiveness tests of our derivative contracts on a spot to spot basis  which excludes the time value related to forward points 
in  we recorded a loss of million related to time value in other expense  net 
effective gains and losses from our derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are realized  at which point they are reclassified to either operating expense  other expense  net or other cost of revenue  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction 
ineffectiveness of our derivative contracts is recorded to other expense  net 
we recorded nominal ineffectiveness in if it becomes probable that an anticipated transaction  which is hedged  will not occur  we immediately reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense  net 
at year end  we had a balance of million remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is expected to be reclassified to income within the next twelve months 
our net foreign currency exposure is diversified among a broad number of currencies
