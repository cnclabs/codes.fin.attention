item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative systems for the treatment of end stage renal disease  or esrd  acute kidney failure and fluid overload 
our primary product  the nxstage system one  is a small  portable  easy to use hemodialysis system designed to provide physicians and patients improved flexibility in how hemodialysis therapy is prescribed and delivered 
in addition to the system one  since october  we also sell needles and blood tubing sets primarily to dialysis clinics for the treatment of esrd  which we refer to as the in center market 
these product lines were obtained in connection with our medisystems acquisition 
although the revenues derived from our medisystems products are a significant percentage of our current revenues  we believe our largest future product market opportunity is for our system one used in the home hemodialysis market  or home market  for the treatment of esrd  which we previously referred to as the chronic market 
we distribute our products in three markets the home  in center and critical care 
we define the home market as the market devoted to the treatment of esrd patients in the home  the in center market as the market devoted to in center hemodialysis  and the critical care market as the market devoted to the treatment of hospital based patients with acute kidney failure or fluid overload 
we offer a different configuration of the system one for each of the home and critical care markets 
the fda has cleared both configurations for hemodialysis  hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
we offer primarily needles and blood tubing sets in the in center market 
our products are predominantly used by our customers to treat patients suffering from esrd or acute kidney failure and we have separate marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market  although in the in center market  nearly all sales are made through distributors 
we received clearance from the fda in july to market the system one for treatment of renal failure and fluid overload using hemodialysis as well as hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
in the first quarter of  we initiated sales of the system one in the critical care market to hospitals and medical centers in the united states 
in late  we initiated sales of the system one for the treatment of patients with esrd 
at the time of these early marketing efforts  our system one was cleared by the fda under a general indication statement  allowing physicians to prescribe the system one for hemofiltration  hemodialysis and or ultrafiltration at the location  time and frequency they considered in the best interests of their patients 
our original indication did not include a specific home clearance  and we were not able to promote the system one for home use at that time 
the fda cleared the system one in june for hemodialysis in the home 
our business expanded significantly in late in connection with our medisystems acquisition 
with that acquisition  we acquired our needle and blood tubing set product lines for use predominantly in in center hemodialysis as well as apheresis 
the medisystems business is significantly more mature than our home and critical care businesses 
medisystems has been selling products to dialysis centers for the treatment of esrd since  and it has achieved leading positions in the united states market for both blood tubing sets and needles 
our blood tubing set products include the readyset high performance blood tubing set  and the streamline 
readyset has been on the market since streamline is our next generation product designed to provide improved patient outcomes and lower costs to dialysis clinics 
this product is early in its market launch and adoption has been limited to date 
our needle products line includes av fistula needle sets 
table of contents incorporating safety features including pointguard anti stick needle protectors  and masterguard technology and buttonhole needle sets 
our av fistula needle sets with masterguard anti stick needle protector were introduced in and our buttonhole needle sets were introduced in our customers receive reimbursement for the dialysis treatments provided with our products typically from medicare  and to a lesser degree from private insurers 
medicare provides comprehensive and well established reimbursement in the united states for esrd 
reimbursement claims for dialysis therapy using the system one or our blood tubing sets and needles are typically submitted by the dialysis clinic or hospital to medicare and other third party payors using established billing codes for dialysis treatment or  in the critical care setting  based on the patient s primary diagnosis 
medicare presently limits reimbursement for chronic hemodialysis to three treatments per week  absent a finding of medical justification 
because most of our system one home dialysis patients are treated more than three times a week  expanding medicare reimbursement over time to cover more frequent therapy may be critical to the market penetration of the system one in the home market and to our revenue growth in the future 
the manufacture of our products is accomplished through a complementary combination of outsourcing and internal production 
specifically  we assemble  package and label our pureflow sl disposables within our fresnillo  mexico facility 
we manufacture components used in our system one cartridge assembly in lawrence  massachusetts  and assemble the disposable cartridge  some blood tubing sets  medics and tranducer protectors in mexico 
we manufacture our dialyzers internally in rosdorf  germany 
we outsource the manufacture of premixed dialysate and needles 
we rely on internal manufacturing and outsourcing for manufacture of our system one cycler  pureflow sl and blood tubing sets we market the system one in the home and critical care market through a direct sales force in the united states primarily to dialysis clinics and hospitals 
we market our medisystems products primarily through distributors  although we also have a small dedicated sales force for that business 
we have increased the number of sales representatives in our combined sales force from at december  to at december  at present  we believe we have an appropriately sized sales force  although this may change as market conditions warrant 
at december    esrd patients were prescribed to receive therapy using the system one at dialysis clinics  compared to  esrd patients at dialysis clinics at december  in addition  at december   hospitals were using the system one for critical care therapy  compared to hospitals at december  the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of revenues derived from each market for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  home in center critical care total revenues for the in center market reflected above consisted of mds entities revenues for the period from october  date of acquisition through december  since inception  we have incurred losses every quarter and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur increasing operating expenses as we continue to grow our business 
we only recently achieved positive gross margins for our products  in aggregate  and we can not provide assurance that our gross margins will improve or  if they do improve  the rate at which they will improve 
we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve profitability  when we will become profitable  the sustainability of profitability should it occur  or the extent to which we will be profitable 
our ability to become profitable is dependent principally upon implementing design and process improvements to lower our costs of manufacturing our products  accessing lower labor cost markets for the manufacture of our products  
table of contents increasing our reliability  improving our field equipment utilization  achieving efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs  achieving efficient distribution of our products  achieving a sufficient scale of operations  and obtaining better purchasing terms and prices 
we will need to sell additional equity or issue debt securities to fund our capital requirements beyond any sale of additional equity or issuance of debt securities will likely result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which would likely harm our business 
additionally  beginning in february  we will need to begin paying down the principal of the debt we borrowed from merrill lynch 
to the extent we are unable to obtain additional financing  this obligation to repay debt will only further increase the need to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business  which would likely harm our business 
statement of operations components revenues we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products 
in the critical care market  we generally sell the system one and related disposables to hospital customers 
in the home market  customers generally rent or purchase the system one equipment  including cycler and pureflow sl  and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
in the in center market  the majority of revenues are derived from supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
we generally recognize revenues when a product has been delivered to our customer  or  in the home market  for those customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenues on a monthly basis in accordance with a contract under which we supply the use of a cycler and the amount of disposables needed to perform a set number of dialysis therapy sessions during a month 
for customers that purchase the system one in the home market  we recognize revenue from the equipment sale ratably over the expected service obligation period  while disposable product revenue is recognized upon delivery 
our rental contracts with dialysis centers for esrd home dialysis patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in some instances  our pureflow sl module 
these contracts typically have a term of one year  and are automatically renewed on a month to month basis thereafter  subject to a days termination notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis clinic 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the free shipment of products to a designated vacation destination 
we derive an insignificant amount of revenues from the sale of ancillary products  such as extra lengths of tubing 
over time  as more home patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes that provide for the purchase or rental of the machine and the purchase of the related disposables  we expect this recurring revenue stream to continue to grow 
in early  we entered into long term home market contracts for the system one with three larger dialysis chains  including with davita  which was our largest customer in each of these agreements has a term of at least three years  and may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights 
these contracts provide the option to purchase as well as rent the system one equipment  and  in the case of the davita contract  davita has agreed to purchase rather than rent a significant percentage of its future system one equipment needs 
in the first quarter of  two of these dialysis chain customers elected to purchase  rather than rent  a significant percentage of their system one equipment currently in use 
we expect  at least in the near term  that the majority of our customers will continue to rent the system one in the home market 
as of december   we had deferred approximately million of revenues related to the sale of equipment in the home market 
our in center revenues are highly concentrated in several significant purchasers 
revenues from schein  our primary distributor  represented approximately of our in center revenues  as measured from october   the closing date of the medisystems acquisition 
revenues from our other two primary distributors over 
table of contents the same period were of our in center revenues 
sales to davita  through schein  represent a significant percentage of these revenues 
davita has contractual purchase commitments under two agreements with medisystems  one for needles and one for blood tubing sets 
davita s purchase obligations with respect to needles expire in january  and its purchase obligations with respect to blood tubing sets expire in september we have no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an extension of these obligations  or that davita s purchase obligations under these contracts will not be reduced  as permitted in certain circumstances under the contracts 
our distribution contracts for our in center market contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing triggers at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discount incentives for early payment 
our sales revenues are presented net of these rebates  incentives  discounts and returns 
our agreement with schein  our primary distributor  will expire in july and our agreements with the other primary two distributors are scheduled to expire in october and july our critical care revenues are less concentrated 
at december   the system one was used in critical care applications in hospitals  none of which accounted for more than of our critical care revenues 
our critical care contracts with hospitals generally include terms providing for the sale of our system one hardware and disposables  although we also provide a hardware rental option 
these contracts typically have a term of one year 
as our business matures  we are starting to derive a small amount of revenue from the sale of one year service contracts following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
similar to our home business  as more system ones are placed within hospitals  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable cartridges for use with our placed system ones as well as  to a much lesser degree  from the sale of service contracts 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  including material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we rent and sell to customers and production overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing system one equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and stock based compensation 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs  and the design of the products 
we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decline over time for four general reasons 
first  we expect to introduce several process and product design changes that have inherently lower cost than our current products second  we plan to continue to move the manufacture and servicing of certain of our products  including the system one cycler and pureflow  to lower labor cost markets 
third  we expect to continue to improve product reliability  which would reduce service and distribution costs 
finally  we anticipate that increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale will lead to better purchasing terms and prices and broader options  and efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs  achieving efficient distribution or process 
we can not  however  guarantee that our expectations will be achieved with respect to our cost reduction plans 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients in the operation of our products 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public 
table of contents awareness of the system one in the home market and other products  particularly streamline in the in center market  and as we add additional sales support and marketing personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to improve and enhance our core products and expand our clinical activities 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight cost of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreement with our customers  and salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and we do not operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products from customers back to our service center for repair if the product is under warranty  and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers 
we expect that distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume  better pricing obtained from carriers following recent price negotiations  the expected customer adoption of our pureflow sl module  which significantly reduces the weight and quantity of monthly disposable shipments  and improved reliability of system one equipment 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees from outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses 
rent  utilities and depreciation expense are allocated to operating expenses based on personnel and square footage usage 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the near term as we add additional administrative support for our growing business

the increase in product cost of approximately million from to was due primarily to the medisystems acquisition and the increase in revenues attributable to the  patients and hospitals as of december  compared to  patients and hospitals as of december  we added  net patients during the twelve months ended december  to arrive at  patients compared to net patients added during the twelve months ending december  to arrive at  patients 
in addition  cost of revenues increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a larger employee base that resulted in additional salaries  health benefits and payroll taxes of million  increased inbound freight costs of million to support our higher production volume  increased service costs of million  and the unfavorable impact of the declining dollar million 
we continue to see incremental improvement in our direct product costs  however  this is currently being partially offset somewhat by an increase in disposable usage per patient and overhead costs due to product reliability issues 
we expect that over time as our reliability improves and as we implement further design enhancements  the disposables per patient and overhead support costs will decline 
selling and marketing our selling and marketing for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage increase increase selling and marketing selling and marketing as a percentage of revenues the primary increase in selling and marketing expense was the result of an increase in headcount and related salary  benefits  payroll taxes and stock based compensation for selling and marketing personnel from to total headcount for sales and marketing and support personnel increased by employees from december  to december   and represented an increase of million in expenses 
in addition  travel  field expenses  and supplies increased by million  and professional service fees for our scientific advisory board  process improvements  and reimbursement efforts increased by million 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the home market and our other products  particularly streamline in the in center market  and as we add additional sales support personnel 

table of contents research and development our research and development for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage decrease decrease research and development research and development as a percentage of revenues the slight decrease in research and development expenses during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable to a shift in spending from research and development efforts associated with pureflow sl module to an increase in clinical efforts associated with our freedom study 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to further enhance our system one and related products  and their reliability  and with the increased activity associated with our ide nocturnal trial  and freedom study  but we do not expect that research and development expenses will increase as rapidly as other expense categories as we have substantially completed basic development of the system one 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
distribution our distribution expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage increase increase distribution distribution as a percentage of revenues the increase in distribution expenses for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to an increased volume of shipments of disposable products to a growing number of patients in the home market  the delivery of additional product  on an expedited basis due to reliability issues  the delivery of product on an expedited basis due to periodic inventory shortages  and the increased equipment deliveries for the pureflow sl module 
we expect that distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected shipping efficiencies gained from increased business volume and density of customers within geographic areas  the reduction of higher cost monthly deliveries associated with bagged fluid due to the lower monthly volumes of disposables on our pureflow sl module  improved product reliability  and the use of an outsourced logistics provider located in the central part of the continental united states 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage increase increase general and administrative general and administrative as a percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to an increase of million of professional fees

we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the near term as we add support structure for our growing business 
other income and expense interest income is derived primarily from us government securities  certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
for the year ended december   interest income decreased by million due to decreased cash and investments over the comparable period ending december  for the year ended december   interest expense increased by million over the comparable period ending december  due to our new credit facility

in addition  cost of revenues increased during because of an increase in manufacturing personnel which resulted in additional salaries  health benefits and payroll taxes of million  higher servicing costs of million and increased inbound freight costs of million to support our higher production volume 
the improvement in gross margin during was attributable to i increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale that led to better purchasing terms and prices  and efficiencies in indirect manufacturing overhead costs  ii lower labor costs for the manufacture of certain of our products  and iii continued improvement in product reliability

r  and approximately million of legal and administrative expenses incurred as a result of operating as a public company 
interest income and interest expense interest income is derived primarily from us government securities  certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
for the year ended december   interest income increased by million due to increased cash and investment balances available for investment resulting from our initial public offering and follow on public offering and  to a lesser degree  higher interest rates 
interest expense increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the early payoff of a debt agreement  which resulted in the early recognition of approximately million of interest expense during the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources we have operated at a loss since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
on november   we obtained a million credit and security agreement from a group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital  a division of merrill lynch business services inc  for a term of months 
the credit facility is secured by nearly all our assets  other than intellectual property and consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we borrowed million under the term loan in november  and have the option to borrow the remaining million by may  we expect that we will borrow this amount 
we used million of the proceeds from the term loan to repay all amounts owed under a term loan dated may  with silicon valley bank 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest equal to libor plus per annum  fixed on november for our first borrowings at a rate of per year and at the date of borrowing for the remaining million still available to be borrowed under the term loan 
interest on the term loan must be paid on a monthly basis 
beginning on february   we must repay principal under the term loan in equal monthly installments 
we will also be required to pay a maturity premium of  at the time of loan payoff 
we are accruing the maturity premium as additional 
table of contents interest over the month term 
our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and calculations of the borrowing amount 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to borrow the full amount  or any funds  under the revolving credit facility 
any borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor plus per annum there is an unused line fee of per annum and descending deferred revolving credit facility commitment fees  which are charged in the event the revolving credit facility is terminated prior to may  of in year one  in year two  and thereafter 
the credit facility includes covenants that a require us to achieve certain minimum net revenue and certain minimum ebitda targets relating to the acquired medisystems business  b place limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur debt  c place limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to grant or incur liens  carry out mergers  and make investments and acquisitions  and d place limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  make other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and amend certain contracts 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants  material adverse effects  and bankruptcy 
in the event we fail to satisfy our covenants  or otherwise go into default  merrill lynch has a number of remedies  including sale of our assets  control of our cash and cash equivalents  and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness 
any of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
on february   we entered into a national service provider agreement with davita  our largest customer 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we granted to davita certain market rights for the nxstage system one and related supplies for home hemodialysis therapy 
under the agreement  davita committed to purchase all of its existing system one equipment currently being rented from nxstage for a purchase price of approximately million and to buy a significant percentage of its future system one equipment needs 
in connection with the national service provider agreement  on february   we issued and sold to davita  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
on june   we closed a follow on public offering in which we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of approximately million from the sale and issuance of  shares of common stock 
on november   we closed our initial public offering in which we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of approximately million from the sale and issuance of  shares of common stock 
prior to the initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through private sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million as of december  the following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net cash flow net cash used in operating activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to net losses after adjustment for non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
significant uses of cash from operations include increases in accounts receivable and increased inventory requirements for production and placements of the system one  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of rental units with our customers represented million  million and million  respectively  during the years ended december   and 
table of contents net cash provided by used in investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and capital improvements to our facilities 
included in these figures is million of cash  net of acquisition costs  acquired from medisystems at the close of the transaction on october  net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from the sale to davita of our common stock  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and net borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from the follow on public offering that closed in june  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and net borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from our initial public offering that closed in november  million of net proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by debt payments of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe we have sufficient cash and cash available through our debt facility to meet our funding requirements through we expect that our existing resources will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond  and we will need to sell additional equity  issue debt securities or otherwise obtain additional capital to fund our operations and our growth 
additionally  beginning in february  we will need to begin paying down the principal on the debt we borrowed from merrill lynch 
any sale of additional equity or issuance of debt securities will likely result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which would likely harm our business

these rental arrangements  which combine the use of the system one with a specified number of disposable products supplied to customers for a fixed amount per month  are recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to a binding customer purchase order and fixed payment terms 
rental arrangements continue to represent the majority of the arrangements we have with our customers in the home market 
equipment utilized under the rental arrangements is referred to as field equipment 
beginning in  we entered into long term customer contracts to sell system one and pureflow sl equipment along with the right to purchase disposable products and service on a monthly basis 
some of these agreements include other terms such as development efforts  training  market collaborations  limited market exclusivity  and volume discounts 
the equipment and related items provided to our customers in these arrangements are considered a multiple element sales arrangement pursuant to eitf when a sales arrangement involves multiple elements  the deliverables included in the arrangement are evaluated to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
we have determined that we cannot account for the sale of equipment as a separate unit of accounting 
therefore  fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment are deferred  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our obligation to supply disposables and service  which is five to seven years 
we have deferred both the unrecognized revenue and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment  which costs are being amortized over the same period as the related revenue 
we entered into a national service provider agreement and a stock purchase agreement with davita on february  pursuant to eitf  we consider these agreements a single arrangement 
in connection with the stock purchase agreement  davita purchased  shares of our common stock for per share  which represented a premium of per share  or million over the current market price 
we have recorded the million premium as deferred revenue and will recognize this revenue ratably over seven years  consistent with our equipment service obligation to davita 
during the twelve months ended december   we recognized revenue of million  associated with the million premium 
in center and critical care market in the critical care market  sales are structured as direct product sales or as a disposables based program in which a customer acquires the equipment through the purchase of a specific quantity of disposables over a specific period of time 
in the in center market  sales are structured primarily through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
we recognize revenues at the later of the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
under a disposables based program  the customer is granted the right to use the equipment for a period of time  during which the customer commits to purchase a minimum number of disposable cartridges or fluids at a price that includes a premium above the otherwise average 
table of contents selling price of the cartridges or fluids to recover the cost of the equipment and provide for a profit 
upon reaching the contractual minimum purchases  ownership of the equipment transfers to the customer 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized over the term of the arrangement as disposables are delivered 
during the reported periods  the majority of our in center and critical care revenues were derived from supply contracts and direct product sales 
our contracts provide for training  technical support and warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
the company recognizes rebates to customers in its in center market in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including reseller of the vendors products 
customer rebates are included as a reduction of sales and trade accounts receivable and are the company s best estimate of the amount of probable future rebates on current sales 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost weighted average or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on an estimated forecast of product demand for each of our existing product configurations 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment field equipment consists of equipment being utilized under disposable based rental agreements as well as service pool cyclers 
service pool cyclers are cyclers owned and maintained by us that are swapped for cyclers that need repairs or maintenance by us while being rented or owned by a patient 
we continually monitor the number of cyclers in the service pool  as well as cyclers that are in transit or otherwise not being deployed by a patient  and assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for such equipment 
during  and  no such impairment was recognized 
we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review the estimated useful life of five years and the asset carrying value periodically for reasonableness 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life and the asset carrying value include industry practice and the typical amortization periods used for like equipment  the frequency and scope of service returns  actual equipment disposal rates  our ability to verify the equipment s existence in the field  and the impact of planned design improvements 
we believe the five year useful life to be reasonable as of december  accounting for stock based awards until december   we accounted for stock based employee compensation awards in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense was recorded for stock options awarded to employees and directors to the extent that the option exercise price was less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant  where the number of shares and exercise price were fixed 
the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the stock option  if any  was recorded as deferred compensation and was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying stock option 
prior to becoming a public company on october   there had been no public market for our common stock 
absent an objective measure of the fair value of our common stock  the determination of fair value required judgment 
our board of directors periodically estimated the fair value of our common stock in connection with any stock option grants 
the fair value of our common stock was estimated based on 
table of contents factors such as independent valuations  sales of preferred stock  the liquidation preference  dividends  voting rights of the various classes of stock  our financial and operating performance  progress on development goals  the issuance of patents  the value of other companies involved in dialysis  general economic and market conditions and other factors that we believed would reasonably have a significant bearing on the value of our common stock 
prior to january   we followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for stock based awards granted to employees 
all stock based awards granted to non employees were accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and related interpretations 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
 stock options granted subsequent to july   the date of filing our initial registration statement with the sec  were valued using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to july   we used the minimum value method permitted under sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  sfas r requires the use of the prospective method for any outstanding stock options that were previously valued using the minimum value method 
accordingly  with the adoption of sfas r  we did not recognize the remaining compensation cost for any stock option awards which had previously been valued using the minimum value method 
in addition  sfas r prohibits the use of pro forma disclosures for stock option awards valued under the minimum value method ie  our pre july  stock option awards 
stock option awards granted prior to july   the date on which we filed our preliminary prospectus with the sec  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  shall be subject to the provisions of sfas r 
we use the modified prospective method under sfas r for any stock options granted after july  the aggregate value of the unvested portion of stock options issued between july  and december  totaled million as of december   net of estimated forfeitures 
beginning in  we began recognizing this aggregate value as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our net loss for the years ended december  and was and million  respectively  higher than if we had continued to account for the share based awards under apb no 
basic and diluted loss per share for the years ended december  and was and higher  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based awards under apb no 
management continues to evaluate the use of stock based awards and may consider other forms of equity based compensation arrangements such as restricted stock units or reduce the volume of stock option grants in the future 
pursuant to sfas r  we reclassified million of deferred compensation relating to non qualified stock options awarded to an executive and a consultant to additional paid in capital on january  prospectively  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the dates of grant 
in accordance with sab  based upon our stage of development and the short period of time that our common stock has been publicly traded on the nasdaq global market  we have used the following assumptions in the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity based compensation awards expected term the expected term has been determined using the simplified method  as defined in sab  for estimating expected option life of plain vanilla options 
unless otherwise determined by the board or the compensation committee  stock options granted under the stock incentive plan have a contractual term of seven years  resulting in an expected term of years calculated under the simplified method 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate for each grant is equal to the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for instruments with an expected life similar to the expected option term 

table of contents volatility the objective in estimating expected volatility is to ascertain the assumption about expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option 
because we have no options that are traded publicly and because of our limited trading history as a public company  our volatility assumption has been based upon an analysis of the stock volatility experienced by similar companies in the medical device and technology industries  consistent with the methodology used in for the year ended december   we reached our two year trading anniversary in the fourth quarter and we began to use our historical trading activity and an analysis of similar companies in the medical device and technology industries in order to derive an expected volatility 
for the year ended december  we used a volatility rate assumption of to 
for the year ended december   we used a volatility rate assumption of the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock award 
we currently expects  based on historical experience  employee growth  and limited trading history  a forfeiture rate of for all awards 
valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in recent business combination under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangibles assets including developed technology  customer relationships and tradenames 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provides a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
intangibles and other long lived assets intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the mds entities are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from three months to seven years 
furthermore  periodically we assess whether our long lived assets including intangible assets  should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for federal and state income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method specified by sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  if any 
substantially all net losses are in the united states 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  while the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and we also had combined federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of million at december   which begin to expire in if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
in the event of a deemed change in control under internal revenue code section  an annual limitation imposed on the utilization of net operating losses may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have million of net operating losses resulting from excess tax deductions relating to stock based compensation 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholders equity in future periods when the losses are utilized to reduce future tax payments 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset has been established as of december  and to reflect these uncertainties 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption of fin and as of december   the company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
the company files federal  state and foreign tax returns 
the company has accumulated significant losses since its inception in since the net operating losses may potentially be utilized in future years to reduce taxable income  all of the company s tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
the company recognizes interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
upon adoption and as of december   the company had no interest and penalty accrual or expense

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations statement r  a replacement of fasb statement no 
statement r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
statement r provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  statement r changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while there is no expected impact to our consolidated financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to december   the adoption of statement r on january  could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to that date 
in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurement statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
statement also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp b which delays the effective date of statement for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually

unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no

r  share based payment 
the use of the simplified method was scheduled to expire on december  sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have 
table of contents enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to the limited period the company s equity shares have been publicly traded 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab sab is effective for options granted after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with a maturity of no more than days 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   we had outstanding debt obligations of million 
we have a million loan with a fixed interest rate equal to and a million loan with an interest equal to the euribor for months plus subject to an interest rate swap agreement at rates greater than 
when euribor months plus exceeds  interest is calculated on a blended basis  with of the nominal value of the loan subject to a fixed rate of  and the remaining subject to the euribor months plus 
as of december   the carrying amount of our debt approximated fair value 
foreign currency exposure we operate a manufacturing and research facility in rosdorf  germany as well as manufacturing facilities in mexico and italy 
we purchase materials for those facilities and pay our employees at those facilities in euros and pesos 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar  including the euro  peso and thai baht 
we also have contracts with key suppliers that expose us to foreign currency risks 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
although it is possible to do so and we may in the future  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
a movement in the euro would have had an overall impact to the statement of operations of approximately million for  which would have been approximately of total annual expenses 
equity security price risk as a matter of policy  we do not invest in marketable equity securities  therefore  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk
