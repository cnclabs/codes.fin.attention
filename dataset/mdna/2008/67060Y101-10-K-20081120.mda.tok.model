overview we are an integrated manufacturer  marketer  distributor and retailer of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold primarily to and through domestic health and natural food stores 
internationally  we market and distribute branded nutritional supplements and other natural products to and through health and natural product distributors and retailers 
our core business strategy is to acquire  integrate and operate  from beginning to end  the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of branded nutritional supplement businesses in the natural products industry 
we believe

we believe that as a result of our emphasis on innovation  quality  loyalty  education and customer service  our brands are widely recognized in health and natural food stores and among their customers 
we were formed in by senior management and bain capital  inc to effect a consolidation strategy in the fragmented vms industry

management believes that nutraceutical is well positioned to continue to capitalize on the consolidation we believe is occurring in the vms industry 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america required us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates included values and lives assigned to acquired intangible assets  reserves for customer returns and allowances  uncollectible accounts receivable  slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory and valuation and recoverability of long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our estimates and judgments related to our critical accounting policies  including factors and assumptions considered in making these estimates and judgments  did not vary significantly for the periods presented and had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements as reported 
our critical accounting policies include the following accounts receivable provision is made for estimated bad debts based on a periodic analysis of individual customer balances  including an evaluation of days sales outstanding  payment history  recent payment trends and perceived credit worthiness 
if general economic conditions and or customer financial condition were to change  additional provisions for bad debts may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
inventories provision is made for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory based on a periodic analysis of individual inventory items  including an evaluation of historical usage and or movement  age  expiration date and general condition 
if market demand and or consumer preferences 
table of contents are less favorable than historical trends or future expectations  additional provisions for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expense is impacted by our judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of assets placed in service 
if the estimated lives of assets are significantly less than expected  depreciation and amortization expense would be accelerated  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of the asset by comparison of its carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset is recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  require estimates and judgments in determining the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets  including factors and assumptions used in determining fair value and useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs that would cause us to believe that value is impaired 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of september each year  which is the last day of our fiscal year 
in accordance with sfas  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of september  reporting unit fair values were determined using the income and market approaches 
based on the valuation findings  we determined that we had a goodwill impairment related to our health food stores reporting unit in accordance with the first step of the goodwill impairment test described in sfas this goodwill impairment was the result of a number of factors  including i the adverse business climate of the specialty retail market which further declined during the quarter ended september   ii flatness in our health food stores sales and iii increased costs associated with new store openings and lease renewals 
we then performed the second step of the impairment test under sfas to measure the amount of the non cash impairment charge  which was determined to be million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charge represented the entire carrying value of goodwill related to our health food stores reporting unit 
during the year ended september   we recorded a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to the re branding of certain of our health food stores 
the charge represented the entire carrying amount of trademark and tradename intangible assets related to our health food stores 
the ongoing uncertainty in general economic and market conditions could negatively impact our future operating performance  cash flow and or stock price and could increase the likelihood of significant additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges being recorded in future periods which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
triggering events in future periods that could potentially warrant an interim review of goodwill and intangible assets to determine whether or not additional impairments exist include a prolonged decrease in our stock price and market 
table of contents capitalization  a sustained decrease in our net sales and or a sustained decrease in our income from operations 
the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from our facilities or  in the case of our neighborhood natural food markets and health food stores  at the point of sale within these stores 
revenue is reduced by provisions for estimated returns and allowances  which are based on historical averages that have not varied significantly for the periods presented  as well as specific known claims  if any 
no other significant deductions from revenue must be estimated at the point in time that revenue is recognized 
for additional information on our accounting policies  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

selected quarterly financial data  seasonality the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for fiscal and this quarterly information is unaudited  has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and  in our opinion  reflects all normally recurring adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data unaudited net sales gross profit net income net income per common share basic diluted we believe that our business is characterized by minor seasonality 
however  sales to any particular customer can vary substantially from one quarter to the next based on such factors as industry trends  timing of promotional discounts  international economic conditions and acquisition related activities 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  we have historically recorded higher branded products sales volume during the second fiscal quarter due to increased interest in health related products among consumers following the holiday season 
the fiscal acquisitions were completed during the first  second and third quarters and the fiscal acquisitions were completed during the first and second quarters 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended september    and  respectively

the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions were financed primarily using borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as cash provided by operating activities 
these acquisitions are in keeping with our business strategy of consolidating the fragmented industry where we compete and give us nutritional brands with products we currently do not sell 
the expected long term sales and expense synergies of acquired businesses are generally not realized immediately following acquisition as certain transition and integration matters must be completed 
capital expenditures during the years ended september    and related primarily to real estate  distribution and manufacturing equipment  building improvements related to facility consolidation efforts and information systems 
on march   we purchased the rapid response center in ogden  utah for million in cash

we were previously leasing most of this facility 
we intend to finance anticipated capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow and  if necessary  through funds provided under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our financing activities during these periods consisted primarily of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility related to operating needs  purchases of common stock for treasury and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in october  we registered a direct stock purchase plan with the securities and exchange commission 
the purpose of this direct stock purchase plan is to provide a convenient way for existing stockholders  as well as new investors  to purchase shares of our common stock 
a total of  shares of our common stock were registered under the plan with  shares purchased during the year ended september  on january   we entered into a five year  sixty million dollar reducing revolving credit facility 
on september   we amended this revolving credit facility the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement extends the term of the credit facility to september  resets the available credit borrowings to sixty million with no automatic reductions and provides an accordion feature which can increase the available credit borrowings to ninety million  subject to approval by the lenders and compliance with certain covenants and conditions 
the lenders on this amended credit agreement are rabobank international and wells fargo 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulties in accessing the available funds under our amended credit agreement 
deferred financing fees of thousand related to the amended credit agreement were capitalized 
at september   we had outstanding revolving credit borrowings of million under the amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all our assets and bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings was  exclusive of any interest rate swap agreements 
we are also required to pay a variable quarterly fee on the unused balance under the amended credit agreement 
at september   the applicable rate was 
accrued interest on eurodollar rate borrowings is payable based on elected intervals of one  two or three months 
accrued interest on base rate borrowings is payable quarterly 
the amended credit agreement matures on september   and we are required to repay all principal and interest outstanding under the amended credit agreement on such date 
the amended credit agreement contains restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring other indebtedness and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
upon the occurrence of a default or an event of default  the lender has various remedies or rights  which may include proceeding against the collateral or requiring us to repay all amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement 
on august   we entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement covering million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings 
the interest rate swap has an all in fixed interest rate of and was not designated as a hedge in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for the year ended september   the interest rate swap had a favorable change in fair value of thousand  which was included as a component of interest and other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a key component of our business strategy is to seek to make additional acquisitions  which may require that we obtain additional financing  which could include the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness 
we believe that borrowings under the amended credit agreement or a replacement credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to make required payments 
table of contents under the amended credit agreement or any such replacement facility  and to make anticipated capital expenditures and fund working capital needs for fiscal our significant non cancelable contractual obligations as of september  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt a operating leases total a represents estimated interest obligations associated with our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of million at september   assuming no principal payments are made before maturity  a weighted average interest rate of and an underutilization fee rate of  offset by a one year interest rate swap covering million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings at an all in fixed rate of 
captive insurance company due to increases in the number of product ingredients excluded from existing insurance policies  as well as potential increases in coverage costs  in fiscal we established and provided funding for a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  american nutritional casualty insurance  inc  which was incorporated in hawaii 
this entity provides coverage for certain of our product liability risks  depending on the availability  pricing and terms of coverage from the traditional insurance market 
we have funded this captive insurance subsidiary with capital contributions  and we pay premiums based on actuarial estimates and input

in november  the fasb decided to postpone for one year the effective date of sfas for other non financial assets and liabilities

we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

we are currently evaluating the impact fsp may have on our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review new accounting standards that are issued 
although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to us  we have not identified any other new standards that we believe merit further discussion  and we expect that none would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation affects the cost of raw materials  goods and services used by us 
in recent years  inflation has been modest 
the competitive environment somewhat limits our ability to recover higher costs resulting from inflation by raising prices 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation primarily through improved productivity and cost containment programs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented  except with respect to increased costs in manufacturing  packaging and distribution resulting from increased fuel and other petrochemical costs  as well as payroll related costs  insurance premiums  and other costs arising from or related to government imposed regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for borrowings was  exclusive of any interest rate swap agreements  and we had total borrowings outstanding of million 
on august   we entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement covering million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings 
the interest rate swap has an all in fixed interest rate of 
with respect to our international operations  we are subject to currency fluctuations  however  we do not believe that these fluctuations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position because the majority of our net sales to foreign countries are transacted in us dollars 
net sales to foreign countries not transacted in us dollars included sales to customers in norway  sweden  canada  the uk  the netherlands and japan 
to date  we have not hedged any of our potential foreign currency exposures
