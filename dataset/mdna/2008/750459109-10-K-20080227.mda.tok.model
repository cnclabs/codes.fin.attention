item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have shifted more of our investments from predominantly perfect fit custom solutions to standards based solutions 
we believe standards based solutions provide our customers a number of fundamental benefits 
first  by using ready made platform solutions rather than ground start custom designs  our customers can achieve significantly shorter product intervals and faster time to market 
second  we believe our customers can achieve a lower total cost by using solutions that are leveraged across multiple applications rather than a single use proprietary solution 
by offering ready made solutions  we believe we have the opportunity to address a wider range of new market opportunities with the potential for faster time to revenue than with ground start  custom designs 
we believe this ability to reuse designs makes our business and investment model more scalable 
finally  we believe a more standards based product model will allow us to provide more integrated higher value solutions to our customers than we have typically delivered under a custom design model 
these higher value solutions drive higher price points and therefore more total revenue opportunities for our products 
promentum in  we announced our plan for the promentum family of atca products 
the promentum family of products include turnkey platforms  universal carrier cards  switch and control modules  disk storage modules  compute modules  packet processing modules and various chassis models 
the promentum sys integrates these individual products into a blade server platform system 
we believe the promentum sys system will provide customers a highly reliable managed platform on which to build their new voice and data offerings 
we have significant experience in the design  delivery and deployment of carrier grade  modular platforms 
we believe the atca standard increases our opportunity to implement reusable platforms  enabling the deployment of more flexible solutions based on cost effective commercial technologies 
we believe our core atca solutions will be applicable across a wide range of customers and applications 
these integrated hardware and software platforms make extensive use of common system architectural and component designs  using carrier grade operating systems and middleware  and will reduce development time and costs  which enhances application portability 
during the first quarter of  we  partnered with aricent  a full service  full spectrum communications software company  demonstrated an atca hardware and software platform designed specifically for wimax networks 
the solution features the aricent sigasn wimax gateway software running on the promentum atca sys  which is the industry s first and only generally available gigabit common managed platform for high bandwidth network element and data plane applications 
our gigabit atca platforms are invaluable to equipment manufacturers developing complex network elements such as wimax asn gateways  g radio network and base station controllers  iptv infrastructure and ip ims compliant media gateways  application servers and media servers 
in the second quarter of  we announced the promentum atca  a digital signal processing dsp blade that offers telecommunications equipment manufacturers tems a way to achieve a low cost per port approach for next generation voip  media processing and media gateway solutions 
the promentum atca extends the award winning gigabit sys atca platform for applications requiring high performance media processing 
in the third quarter of  we announced the availability of our promentum atca based on texas instruments dsp and telogy software 
in the second quarter of  we also announced the introduction of a microtca platform development kit aimed at helping tems develop network elements geared toward a smaller and more cost effective form factor than existing products 
in the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of the mcpd business  including products in the atca and compact pci lines  of intel corporation intel for million in cash at closing 
we believe the acquisition will further our global leadership position in atca platforms and solutions for 
table of contents telecommunication equipment manufacturers worldwide 
the addition of the intel modular communication assets to our award winning promentum product family should also help us broaden our customer base and expand our addressable market 
early in  we introduced two new products in our promentum atca product portfolio 
first was the promentum atca  a gigabit atdvancedtca single slot processor blade 
we believe this product provides enhanced features for compute intensive applications where transaction and subscriber load can increase dramatically in short intervals  such as ims  iptv and wireless control plan based applications 
the second was the promentum atca dual octeon plus packet processing module  the industry s first blade to enable highest density of gigabit ethernet interfaces in a single slot with significantly higher processing power and bandwidth access when compared to other platforms available today 
procelerant in addition to our atca offerings  we offer a procelerant series of modular computing solutions  for customers in our commercial systems market for medical  transaction terminals and test and measurement and other commercial applications 
these new modular products are now available  and we believe this family of high density  flexible solutions enables our commercial systems customers to achieve more rapid time to market with cost effective designs 
during the first quarter of  we announced the availability of two new pci industry computer manufacturers group picmg compatible com express modules and a quad core embedded server that delivers unsurpassed performance and functionality 
the intel core duo processor based com express module coupled with dual channel memory brings maximum computing performance to imaging  gaming  and test and measurement devices that require the smallest com express form factor on the market 
the second com express module that was announced features an extended temperature range com express module and fills a highly desired need for in flight infotainment  industrial and military applications 
the quad core server with intel core microarchitecture increases the performance of imaging and signaling applications five to seven fold compared to servers available just months ago 
we also announced  in the first quarter of  a partnership with virtuallogix  the real time virtualization company  to deliver a real time development kit that enables embedded systems designers to combine linux and our os real time operating system onto a single platform 
this will enable our customers to improve performance  reduce power consumption and consolidate multiple single core designs onto a single  integrated platform 
in the second quarter of  we introduced a new com express module aimed at supporting high performance communications applications 
when incorporated with our promentum  system designers gain a switch and control module well suited for radio network controller  media gateway  ims and iptv applications 
the ce utilizes a core duo l processor and offers flexible storage in an effort to meet reliability and cost requirements of both equipment manufacturers and service providers 
early in  we introduced a new procelerant quad core server  the industry s first embedded server to incorporate the latest intel quad core xeon processors 
intended for medical and other imaging  test and measurement  and other digital signal processing applications  the procelerant rms xsl quad core server supports superior image processing at a higher resolution and with greater speed compared to previous embedded servers 
convedia media servers in the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of convedia and entered the media server market with a portfolio of media server products 
included in this portfolio are our newest media servers  the cms and cms  which are optimized for ims network deployments 
these solutions are based on a modular hardware platform  which incorporates the latest dsps and processor chipsets and utilize our extended media processing exmp technology 
the cms family consolidates the functions of traditional announcement servers  interactive voice response units  audio and video conference bridges  messaging platforms and speech platforms into a single  multi service  open standards compliant solution for network and enhanced services media processing 
our cms share identical control interfaces  media processing features and management capabilities 
the many features and benefits of our cms allow our customers to 
table of contents increase revenues through delivery of new and innovative services  while reducing capital and ongoing operational costs 
during the second quarter of  we announced the general availability of these two products 
and during the third quarter of  we introduced a new media processing blade for the cms the new mpc iv blade delivers the telecommunication industry s highest capacity for conferencing  video and low bitrate codec applications 
in the second quarter of  we announced the introduction of the convedia software media server 
this solution provides an economical ip audio and video media processing solution for atca and linux based platforms 
this advance marks the first product based on integrated technology from radisys and convedia since the acquisition 
financial results total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
revenues in the communications networking market increased from to primarily due to the addition of media server revenues and mcpd revenues 
revenues also increased due to increased wireless revenues partially offset by decreases in the ip networking and messaging submarket 
in the fourth quarter  our wireless business increase was driven in part by some acceleration of customer demand  from the first quarter into the fourth quarter 
revenues in the commercial systems market increased in the compared to  primarily due to increases within the test and measurement submarket partially offset by declines in our transaction terminal submarket 
the increase in revenues from the test and measurement submarket was attributable to design wins that have ramped into production in the latter half of the decrease in revenues attributable to the transaction terminal submarket was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
currently  our standards based products do not make up a significant percentage of our total revenues  however  we believe design wins associated with these products will begin to ramp into production in from a geographic perspective  from to the percentage of non us revenues by delivery destination increased as a percentage of total revenues 
this was primarily due to existing multinational customers requesting the delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region offset by decreased revenues attributable to our emea region associated with our wireless infrastructure products 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america increased by million compared to the same period in this increase is due primarily to the addition of revenues from the media server and mcpd businesses 
we expect our non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to amortization of purchased technology of million 
we reclassified this amortization in to cost of sales based on our view that the intangibles are associated with product costs and our revenue generating process 
amortization of purchased technology for prior periods is considered immaterial and has not been adjusted 
this decrease is also due to product mix in our communications and commercial markets  increased excess and obsolescence inventory charges and costs associated with the remaining transitions from our north carolina manufacturer 
we currently expect our gross margins in to be similar to net loss was million and million in and  respectively 
net income was million in net loss per share was and for and  respectively 
net income per share was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net loss has increased from to  due primarily to a full year of operating expenses attributed to the acquisition of convedia  lower gross margins  increased stock based compensation expense and lower interest income 

table of contents from through  we initiated multiple restructurings of our operations 
these restructurings primarily included workforce reductions 
these workforce reductions were a result of the reorganization of our manufacturing strategy and the realignment of our workforce to integrate our media server business 
cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to million in cash at closing used to purchase the mcpd business partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
shelf registration statement on october   we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on form s for the offering from time to time of up to million in securities consisting of common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities 
the sec declared the shelf registration effective on november  except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes  which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses  repaying existing debt  providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets 
on february   we offered and sold in a public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the convertible senior notes 
interest is payable semi annually  in arrears  on each august and february  beginning on august   to the holders of record at the close of business on the preceding august and february  respectively 
the convertible senior notes mature on february  holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes into a number of shares of our common stock determined as set forth in the indenture governing the notes  which we refer to as the conversion rate  at their option on any day to and including the business day prior to the maturity date 
the convertible senior are initially convertible into shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  holders of the convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
in addition  if certain fundamental changes occur  we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any convertible senior notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
the notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  including our convertible senior notes  and senior in right of payment to our future subordinated debt 
our obligations under the convertible senior notes are not guaranteed by  and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of  our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into a capped call transaction with a hedge counterparty 
the capped call transaction is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction of approximately  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the notes 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction of  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited  which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction 
the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible senior notes were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  estimated offering expenses and the cost of the capped call transaction 

table of contents acquisition as discussed above  on september   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of the mcpd business  including products in the atca and compact pci lines  of intel 
in connection with the completion of the acquisition  we paid to intel approximately million in cash at closing 
the acquisition will further our global leadership position in atca platforms and solutions for telecommunication equipment manufacturers worldwide 
the addition of the intel modular communication assets to our award winning promentum product family will also help us broaden our customer base and expand our addressable market 
in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we record the inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
pursuant to arb and sab topic bb  our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
adverse purchase commitments we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products  for which there is no alternative use 
excess inventory is defined as raw materials or assemblies components used in the manufacture of our products for which the contract manufacturers on hand and on order quantities are in excess of the requirements derived from our current 
table of contents product forecast of customer demand 
we are liable for excess inventory only to the extent that the contract manufacturer procures components to fulfill the manufacturing requirements as set forth in our current product forecast and agreed upon lead times and minimum order quantities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
factors influencing the adverse purchase commitments liability include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  customer liability and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management we may incur additional expenses due to increases in our adverse purchase commitment liabilities 
our estimate for the adverse purchase commitments liabilities is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current adverse purchase commitments liabilities may be inadequate 
estimates for adverse purchase commitments are derived from reports received on a quarterly basis from our contract manufacturers 
increases to this liability are charged to cost of goods sold 
when and if we take possession of inventory reserved for in this liability  the liability is transferred from other liabilities to our excess and obsolete inventory valuation allowance 
this liability  referred to as adverse purchase commitments  is provided for in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
adverse purchase commitments amounted to million at december  and december  accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with prior acquisitions 
goodwill will be written down or written off when impaired 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances conditions indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that as of september   there was no goodwill impairment 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis consists of comparing our book value to our market capitalization 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period  a goodwill impairment test will be performed 
our book value per share was at september  compared to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market or the trading price on september  of 

table of contents management concluded there was no indication of material changes requiring an updated goodwill impairment analysis as of december  intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements  a building and other physical assets owned by radisys 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset  which is determined based on the associated net present value of estimated future cash flows 
we would estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate approximately million and million in taxable income in the united states and canada  respectively  prior to the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which will occur between and we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
to the extent that the valuation allowance was recognized as a result of purchase accounting  the reduction of the valuation allowance would reduce the associated goodwill 
all other reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our two largest customers 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and there were no significant account balances reserved for and the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by  as a result of additional provisions partially offset by the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to approximately of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring and other charges for the years ended december   and expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
because we have a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities that were vacated and subleased  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  was recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by the following revenue recognition criteria an agreement with the customer  fixed pricing  transfer of title and risk of loss and customer acceptance  if applicable  and that the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  or for software  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we first allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of 
table of contents product  infrequently we enter into agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
the components of total revenues were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software royalties and licenses software maintenance engineering and other services other total revenues hardware revenue from hardware products where software is incidental is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights as well as for price protection rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the software content included in hardware products such as our convedia media servers and certain components of our atca solutions are considered to be more than incidental and therefore the revenue associated with these products is recognized in accordance with statement of positions sop software royalties and licenses revenue from software royalties and licenses is recognized in accordance with sop revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided when the revenue recognition criteria have been met and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
software maintenance software maintenance services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contract in accordance with sop the fair value of our post contract support has been determined by renewal rates within the company s support agreements as well as the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered in accordance with sop other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 

table of contents deferred revenue deferred revenue represents amounts received or billed for the following types of transactions distributor sales certain sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
undelivered elements of an arrangement certain software sales include a specified free upgrade to an existing product 
revenue for such products is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled 
service sales certain sales are made for products and related service where the fair value of the service cannot be determined 
revenues for such sales are deferred until all elements are delivered 
the company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
stock based compensation equity instruments are granted to employees  directors and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
in and  we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options  restricted stock  and stock issued to employees as a result of the espp 
in  we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options  restricted shares and stock issued to employees as a result of espp 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all stock based employee benefit plan equity awards granted after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award for those shares expected to vest as described below 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we continue to use the black scholes model to measure the grant date fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the grant date fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is equal to the option vesting period which is generally years 
the grant date fair value of espp shares that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally months  subject to modification at the date of purchase due to the espp look back feature 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is years 
the estimate of the number of options  espp shares and restricted stock expected to vest is determined based on historical experience 
to determine the fair value of the stock options and espp shares  using the black scholes option pricing model  the calculation takes into consideration the effect of the following exercise price of the option or purchase price of the espp share  price of our common stock on the date of grant  expected term of the option or share  
table of contents expected volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the option or share  and risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option or share 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
as part of our sfas r adoption  we also examined our historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations 
from this analysis  we identified three employee populations 
the expected term computation is based on historical vested option exercises and post vest forfeiture patterns and includes an estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  for each of the three populations identified 
the estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  was determined as the midpoint of a range of estimated expected terms determined as follows the low end of the range assumes the fully vested and outstanding options settle on december  and the high end of the range assumes that these options expire upon contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 
determining the appropriate fair value model and  as noted above  calculating the fair value of equity instruments associated with our employee benefit plans require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these equity instruments represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest

revenues in the communications networking market increased in compared to due primarily to the addition of media server business and mcpd revenues 
revenues also increased due to increased wireless revenues partially offset by decreases in the ip networking and messaging submarket 
in the fourth quarter of our wireless business increase was driven in part by some acceleration of customer demand into the fourth quarter 
revenues in the commercial systems market increased in the compared to  primarily due to increases within the test and measurement submarket 
the increase in revenues from the test and measurement submarket was attributable to design wins that have ramped into production in the latter half of given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets 
we currently expect that each of our markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we currently expect wireless revenues to grow modestly over currently  our standards based products do not make up a significant percentage of our total revenues  however  we believe design wins associated with these products will begin to ramp into production in based on the timing of our customers next generation system deployments

we reclassified this amortization in to cost of sales based on our view that the intangibles are associated with product costs and our revenue generating process 
amortization of purchased technology for prior periods is considered immaterial and has not been adjusted 
this decrease is also due to product mix in our communications and commercial markets  increased excess and obsolescence inventory charges and costs associated with the remaining transitions from our north carolina manufacturer

interest expense includes interest expense incurred on the convertible senior and the convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense decreased  or  from million in to million in the decrease in the interest expense in compared to is due to the payment of the remaining principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes in august of interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in interest income decreased primarily due to our decreased cash and cash equivalents and investments balance associated with the purchase of convedia and mcpd other income expense  net

income tax provision 
we recorded tax benefits of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the year ended december  the company s current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of stock option expense  research and development tax credits generated in  the revaluation of certain net deferred tax assets due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and taxes on foreign income that differ from us tax rate 
on december   president bush signed the tax relief and health care act of the tax relief act  which extended the research and development tax credit 
under the tax relief act the research and development tax credit was retroactively reinstated to january  and is available through december  we have recorded federal and canadian research and development credits of approximately  and million  respectively  for the year ended at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from the acquisition of microware in august and certain expired general business tax credit carryforwards resulting from the merger with texas micro inc in  which had been previously reserved  offset by an increase in the valuation allowance caused by decreases in the projected income related to state net operating losses 
over the last two years as well as the current year we have generated cumulative book income after adjusting for purchase accounting and nonrecurring related adjustments 
as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million and million in taxable income in the united states and canada  respectively  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which will occur between and we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income change or are 
table of contents not achieved 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
to the extent that the valuation allowance was recognized as a result of purchase accounting  the reduction of the valuation allowance would reduce the associated goodwill 
all other reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
finally  any tax benefit subsequently recognized from the acquired net operating loss and research and development tax credit associated with our microware acquisition  completed in  would be allocated to goodwill and will not benefit the income statement 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  as of december  will be realized 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states 
and ten foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
in determining the value of income tax liabilities we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
if these amounts provided prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result

revenues were also higher due to deployments of new products by one of our major customers as well as the addition of media server business revenues 
for the fourth quarter of the increase in communication revenues was offset by reductions in requested deliveries from a large wireless customer 
we believe these reductions were driven by their efforts to significantly reduce inventory levels

in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into a capped call transaction with a hedge counterparty 
the capped call transaction is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction of approximately  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the notes 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction of  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited  which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction 
the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible senior notes were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  estimated offering expenses and the cost of the capped call transaction 
liquidity outlook we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments  net  amounting to million at december   of which million consisted of ars  the cash generated from operations and our line of credit facility will satisfy our short and long term expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing business operations even if we are required to hold our ars until maturity 
capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million per quarter as we make additional r d and it capital investments 
as noted above  in february  we offered and sold million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes and received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  offering expenses and the cost of a capped call transaction

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our debt securities that we have invested in at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the euro  british pound sterling  new shekel  japanese yen  chinese yuan  canadian dollar and malaysian ringgit 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of  for the year ended december   a net gain of  for the year ended december  and a net loss of  for the year ended december  in january  to mitigate the risk associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we entered into twelve foreign currency forward contracts of million in canadian dollars that mature monthly over the next twelve months 
convertible senior notes 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes  due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
unless we elect to repurchase our senior convertible notes in the open market  changes in the fair value of the senior convertible notes have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
in february  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible senior notes  with an associated discount of  we repurchased the notes in the open market for million and  as a result  recorded a gain of
