item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we design  develop and market innovative liquid fuel cell products principally for the mobile handset and portable consumer electronics markets 
our first commercial product is our power pack a small  inexpensive and disposable power source capable of providing direct power or multiple recharges to many of the most advanced portable electronic devices  such as mobile handsets  smart phones  mp players  gaming and other handheld electronic devices 
we believe that the power pack is the world s first commercially viable portable fuel cell solution for the consumer market and represents a significant technological achievement in the advancement of the global fuel cell industry 
a fuel cell is an electro chemical device that through a chemical reaction  converts the chemical energy of a fuel  such as hydrogen  methanol  or our patented borohydride based fuel into electrical energy 
through cell kinetics ltd  our indirect  majority owned subsidiary  we are also seeking to exploit commercially what we believe to be an ever increasing need to study individual live cells through the development  marketing and sale of an improved cell carrier under the ckchip product line 
this unique ckchip can accommodate up to  cells  each in individual wells  for measuring reactions of living cells while the cells are in a static state for a considerably long period of time 
results of operations from our inception in april through december   we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  increases in selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses related to the introduction of our products  cost related to commercialization of our fuel cell products  costs related ramping up production on our fully automated production line and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
since our inception  we have relied principally on outside sources of funding to finance our operations  as our revenues have been minimal 
in november and december  pursuant to a november  equity distribution agreement with an investment banker  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for proceeds of approximately  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  additionally  from january through march   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock  pursuant to the agreement  bringing the aggregate proceeds through march  to approximately  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  in november and december  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our series a cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock at a price of  per share for gross proceeds of  less issuance costs of approximately  additionally  in july and august  we issued  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due july  less issuance costs of approximately  the convertible notes were exchanged for shares of our common stock in april and may see discussion below 
although we have received purchase orders for our power pack product which together provide for large scale delivery during our first two years of product availability  we will not derive any revenues under the purchase orders unless and until we commence large scale manufacturing of our first fuel cell product 
our fully automated production line located at the facilities of our contract manufacturer  celestica ireland ltd  in galway  ireland has begun production 
we are coordinating the production ramp up with our distributors roll out plans for our product and other anticipated demand  as celestica trains personnel to operate additional shifts 
we expect our reliance on outside sources of funding to continue until we are able to successfully commercialize our fuel cell or any of our other products or technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
our research and development costs have increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   as we have continued to devote greater efforts to develop and advance the technology underlying  and to commercialize the products incorporating  our fuel cells  however  if we are unable to successfully commercialize our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies  we will be forced to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate significant revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained a net loss of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the net loss can be primarily attributed to increases during the year ended december  in research and development costs  principally due to increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts as we moved towards commercialization of our fuel cell products  and increased selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  as more fully described below 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due principally to charges aggregating  that we recorded during the year ended december  in connection with the april and may exchanges of our common stock for our then outstanding convertible notes 
as we continue to commercialize and market our fuel cell products and work to develop new products  we expect that we will continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and research and development costs for our fuel cell products  as well as selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  in costs related to our fuel cell technologies 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development costs in related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  primarily reflects costs incurred in preparing our fuel cell power pack product for high volume production and results from increases in labor including stock option cost pursuant to our adoption of sfas r in january  materials  subcontractors and consultants  depreciation and other costs 
cell kinetics cell carrier ckchip 
we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  costs incurred during the year ended december  principally related to improvement and modifications of our cell carrier design to enable its use with standard fluorescence microscopes  as well as development and validation of specific applications to be used with the cell carrier in order to enhance introduction and commercialization of our cell carrier ckchip product line 
costs incurred during year ended december  related to the further refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan  various research activities including initial steps in modifying the cell carrier design to enable its use with standard fluorescence microscopes and in obtaining the ce mark and moving forward with our iso application  as well as clarifying other regulatory requirements needed for further commercialization of our products 
the increases in can be primarily attributed to increases in labor and related costs  depreciation and other costs  partially offset by decreases in material costs 
in july  cell kinetics entered into an agreement with scorpion surgical technologies  ltd 
to acquire a aggregate interest in scorpion for a total investment of  of which  was paid in july scorpion is a start up company in the field of orthopedic surgical instrumentation  with particular emphasis upon spinal anchoring device and stabilization systems 
the chief executive officer of cell kinetics is a director and a co founder of scorpion 
other r d activities 
we have been devoting more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing our fuel cell based products 
as a result  other than as described above with respect to the cell carrier ckchip  we have been devoting few  if any  resources to our other technologies 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to   compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increases of  in is primarily attributable to increases in non cash charges relating to the issuance of stock options  warrants and restricted stock of approximately  resulting principally from our adoption of sfas r on january   increases in labor and related costs of approximately  due principally to an increased allocation to sg a as our operations transition from primarily research and development to manufacturing  marketing and sales  as well as an increase in pay rates  increases in costs of the issuance of and maintenance of patents and legal and other professional fees of approximately  increases in marketing costs of approximately  increases in insurance costs of approximately  and net increases in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during both the year ended december  and december  the amortization of intangible assets in both periods represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy ltd 
that we did not already own 
net interest income and expenses during the year ended december  amounted to net interest income of approximately  compared to net interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december  the change of  between the years ended december  and is primarily due to decreases in interest expense of  during the year ended december   principally due to aggregate costs of approximately  recorded as interest expense in in connection with the april and may exchanges of our then outstanding convertible notes for common stock consisting of the value of the shares issued in lieu of future interest payments of approximately  the amortization of the remaining balance of the beneficial conversion features of approximately  and out of pocket costs incurred in connection with the exchange transactions and interest incurred on the convertible notes of approximately  during the year ended december  prior to their exchange  partially offset by an unrealized loss on a short term investment of approximately  and losses on translation of balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar of approximately  the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest income of  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  as of december   we had unrecognized compensation costs of approximately  related to stock options accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised share based payments  which are expected to be recognized in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in the net loss can primarily be attributed to charges to interest expense aggregating approximately  related to the exchanges in april and may of our common stock for all of our outstanding convertible notes and increases in research and development costs primarily due to increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products 
additionally  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as more fully described below 
as we approach final stages of the anticipated commercialization of our fuel cell products  we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and research and development costs for our fuel cell products 
we recognized revenues of  and cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   compared to revenues of  and cost of revenues of  during the year ended december  the revenues in both years are attributable to completed orders that we received from general dynamics c systems  inc  a unit of general dynamics corporation relating to our fuel cell products and technology 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in research and development costs incurred during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  related to our fuel cell technologies 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products as we move towards commercialization and result from increases in labor  materials  depreciation and other costs 
cell kinetics cellscan  cell carrier 
we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december  relating to the further refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan  on various research activities including modifying the cell carrier design to enable its use with standard fluorescence microscopes and in obtaining the ce mark and moving forward with our iso application  as well as clarifying other regulatory requirements needed for further commercialization of our products  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  for further refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various research activities 
the increases in our cellscan related research and development costs during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to increases materials costs for the assembly of additional desktop cellscans  labor costs including new cell carrier design costs and cell carrier coating development and other expenses  partially offset by a decrease in costs of subcontractors and consultants 
other r d activities 
we have been devoting more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing our fuel cell based products 
as a result  other than as described above with respect to the cellscan  we have been devoting few resources to many of our other technologies 
selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  year ended december  the increases of  for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to increases in non cash charges relating to the issuance of stock options of approximately  resulting principally from our adoption of sfas r on january   increases in costs for the issuance and maintenance of patents and other professional fees of approximately  increases in insurance costs of approximately  increases in depreciation expense of approximately  increases in executive consulting costs of approximately  increase in selling and marketing costs of approximately  and net increases in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  partially offset by decreases in labor and related costs of approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  for each of the years ended december  and december  the amortization of intangible assets in both periods represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy ltd 
that we did not already own 
net interest income and expenses during year ended december  amounted to net other expenses of approximately  compared to net other expense of approximately  during the year ended december  the difference of  between the years is due to an increase in interest expense of  partially offset by increases in interest income of  the increase in interest expense during the year ended december  is principally due to aggregate costs of approximately  recorded as interest expense in connection with the april and may exchanges of our then outstanding convertible notes for common stock consisting of the value of the shares issued in lieu of future interest payments of approximately  the amortization of the remaining balance of the beneficial conversion features of approximately  and out of pocket costs incurred in connection with the exchange transactions partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred on our convertible notes prior to their exchange of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in interest income during the year ended december  of  is primarily due to increases in our average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances in compared to the same period in resulting principally from the proceeds of our issuance of our convertible notes in july and august and our series a preferred stock in november and december  as well as increases in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and  credited to interest income upon the exercise of a day option to acquire up to an additional  of our series a preferred stock that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance in november of the first  of series a preferred stock 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and related securities and exchange commission rules included in staff accounting bulletin no 
 on a modified prospective basis 
as a result of adopting sfas r  our net loss for the year ended december   is  greater than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing 
from november through march  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  pursuant to a november  equity distribution agreement with an investment banker 
in november and december  we issued series a preferred stock to qualified institutional investors in a private offering 
in july and august  we issued convertible notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers and in april and may exchanged our then outstanding convertible notes for common stock 
we expect to continue to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity until such time as we successfully commercialize our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities  the amount of resources required to complete our production facilities and product launch and ramp up  our anticipation  based on our current expectation that we will sell out the production capacity of our first fully automated production line  that we will undertake to build a second fully automated  and variability of currency exchange rates in relationship to the us dollar 
a portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies applicable to our business are the new israeli shekel  the euro and the swiss franc 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
recently  the us dollar has been volatile relative to foreign currencies and frequently has been weak 
such weakness of the us dollar has negatively impacted our cash flows and results of operations and continued foreign currency fluctuations including a weaker us dollar  could significantly harm our cash flow and results of operations  as well as our ability to achieve and maintain profitability as we continue to grow our business 
another source of income or other means to affect our cash expenditures are collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
since january  we have realized revenues of  on costs of revenues of  as well as credits against our research and development costs of approximately  with respect to collaborative arrangements with third parties relating to our fuel cell technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will realize additional revenue or credits to our research and development expense from collaborative arrangements 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will raise additional funds through any financing approach implemented by us 
in april   we completed an exchange of our then outstanding convertible notes for common stock whereby the holders of an aggregate of  in principal amount of the convertible notes exchanged their convertible notes for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
such number of shares  which aggregated of our then issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to this transaction  includes  shares  valued at per share  in lieu of future interest payments had our convertible notes remained outstanding until their maturity  after giving effect to an eighteen month waiver of such payments 
in may   we completed a second exchange of our then outstanding convertible notes whereby the holders of the remaining  in principal amount of the convertible notes exchanged their convertible notes for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
such number of shares includes  shares of our common stock  valued at per share  in lieu of future interest payments had such convertible notes remained outstanding until their maturity  after giving effect to an eighteen month waiver of such payments 
in november and december  we issued  shares of our series a preferred stock in a private offering for aggregate gross proceeds of  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  the annual cash dividend on each share of our series a preferred stock is and is payable quarterly  in arrears  commencing on february  each share of our series a preferred stock is convertible at the holder s option at any time into shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
on or after november   if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for trading days during any consecutive trading day period  we may cause the conversion of our series a preferred stock into common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate 
of the total  of our series a preferred stock issued   was issued pursuant to the exercise of a day option that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance of the first  of our series a preferred stock 
in november   concurrent with our offering of our series a preferred stock  we issued million shares of our common stock in an offering registered under the securities act of the shares of common stock issued were loaned to an affiliate of citigroup global markets limited under a year share lending agreement 
the only consideration that we received was a share lending fee of 
per share  or an aggregate of  the loaned shares were used by cgml to promote the sale of our series a preferred stock by facilitating hedging transactions that may be undertaken by purchasers of our series a preferred stock in the private offering described above 
proceeds from our series a preferred stock and debt financings and other proceeds have been and will continue to be used for corporate expense and capital expenditures  including for the construction  validation  start up and other costs related to a fully automated manufacturing line and related facilities for our fuel cell products  as well as for other working capital purposes  research and development costs and selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses 
as of december   commitments for capital expenditures in aggregated approximately  which primarily relate to our fully automated production line and related facilities 
in november and december  pursuant to a november  equity distribution agreement with an investment banker  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for proceeds of approximately  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  additionally  from january through march   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock  pursuant to the agreement  bringing the aggregate proceeds through march  to  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  the agreement provides for our sale of a maximum of  of our common stock 
in furtherance of our plan to commercialize the cell carrier technology  medis el assigned all of its intellectual property rights to the cellscan  including the cell carrier  to cell kinetics on july  we also agreed to provide to cell kinetics  over an month period starting with the completion of a then contemplated rights offering  an unrestricted capital contribution of up to  on an as needed basis 
furthermore  in the event that such  capital contribution along with other available funds would be insufficient for cell kinetics to carry out its operations for at least one year from the completion of this rights offering  we agreed to provide cell kinetics with additional financing from time to time to ensure that cell kinetics will have sufficient funds to carry out its operations for at least one year from the completion of the rights offering 
additionally  we and medis el have agreed to provide office and laboratory facilities and administrative services to cell kinetics at cost as a contribution to capital  for a period of at least months form the completion of the rights offering 
on january   cell kinetics completed a rights offering pursuant to which subscribers purchased an aggregate of  of cell kinetics ordinary shares  at the subscription price of per share 
subscribers also received four year warrants to purchase additional cell kinetics ordinary shares  at an exercise price of per share  at the rate of one such warrant for every two ordinary shares purchased in the rights offering 
under the terms of the rights offering  record holders of our outstanding common stock received  at no cost  one nontransferable subscription right for every ten shares of our common stock held by them as of the close of business on the record date  which was november  as mentioned above  subscribers also received four year warrants to purchase additional cell kinetics ordinary shares  at an exercise price of per share  at the rate of one such warrant for every two ordinary shares purchased in the rights offering 
upon the completion of the rights offering  we continued to own approximate of cell kinetics outstanding ordinary shares and subscribers owned the balance 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  during the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in expenditures for research and development costs and selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  as described above  as well as an increase in inventory of raw materials and components for the production of our fuel cell products 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented i purchases of property and equipment of  of which approximately  represents costs related to building and equipping our fully automated and semi automated production lines and related facilities  ii investments in short term investments of  less redemptions of short term investments of  iii restricted cash and deposits of  less redemptions of  and iv equity investment in an early stage company of  during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented i purchases of property and equipment of  of which approximately  represents costs related to building and equipping our fully automated and semi automated production lines and related facilities  and ii investments in short term investments of  less redemptions of short term investments of  as of december   our short term investments of  represented an auction rate security with a face value of  less a valuation reserve of  recent uncertainties in the credit markets have resulted in unsuccessful auctions  since the third quarter of  for such security 
the interest on this auction rate security continues to be paid monthly at an increased rate 
we examined the value of the auction rate security in the failed auction and assessed it for possible impairment generally in accordance with sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and fasb staff position fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
since we believe that the subsequent failed auctions and the continuing decline in the bids from the ultimate debtor are reflecting an impairment of the underlying assets securing the auction rate security at december   we have recorded  based on the most current bids  a valuation reserve of  on such auction rate security 
during the year ended december   net cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  which represented i net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of our common stock  as described more fully above ii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options issued under our stock option plan of which  shares were exercised by our executive officers and also the proceeds of which  was from exercises that took place during december and ii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants  partially offset by iv dividend payments on our series a preferred stock aggregating approximately  ii payments of approximately  for issuance costs on our series a preferred stock that was issued in november and december the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  aggregating  was generated from i proceeds from our issuance of our series a preferred stock of  less issuance costs of approximately  paid during the year ended december   ii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by our executive officers  and iii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants  and iv  received as consideration in our share lending agreement  pursuant to which we lent  shares of our common stock to the initial purchaser of our series a preferred stock see discussion above 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating  comprised of cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  and an additional  of restricted cash and deposits 
on october   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement on form s which was declared effective on october   with a maximum amount of  through march   pursuant to a november  equity distribution agreement with an investment bank see discussion above  we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately  less issuance costs of  of which net proceeds of approximately  were raised during the period from january  through march  
we anticipate that we will seek additional financing  once we exhaust the remaining balance of approximately  available under this agreement  for working capital and other operating needs in the form of equity and or debt financing and accounts receivable inventory financing  to augment our existing funds until we are able to finance our operations from the sales of our power pack product 
our failure to successfully commercialize or sell our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies would require us to seek outside sources of financing to raise additional funds for working capital or other purposes 
however  such failure may materially adversely affect our ability to raise such additional funds  if needed 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to further develop our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies or market and produce our fuel cell products at commercially viable level 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december payment due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter capital lease obligation operating lease obligation purchase obligations other long term liabilities note total note other long term liabilities represents our accrued severance pay as of december  since we do not expect a high level of employee turnover giving rise to the payment of significant amounts of severance obligations  we have included approximately of the total liability in each of the years through and the remainder in and thereafter 
tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el  the predecessor to cell kinetics in its cellscan and cell carrier related business  received approximately  in research and development grants related to the cellscan technology from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  cell kinetics as the assignee of medis el s contingent obligation in connection with cell kinetics acquisition of medis el s cellscan and cell carrier related business  including its intellectual property rights relating to the cellscan and its cell carrier technology  is required to pay of its sales of cellscan related products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if cell kinetics wishes to sell the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aircraft industries ltd 
formerly known as israel aerospace industries ltd  its largest stockholder  its obligation relating to the repayment of grants out of future royalties  if any  of approximately  which contingent obligation cell kinetics also assumed in connection with its acquisition of medis el s cellscan and cell carrier related business 
as of december   cell kinetics total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries presently receive any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the investment law and the tax benefits that we may derive there from can be summarized as follows the facilities of more energy  our israeli fuel cell subsidiary  have been granted status of an approved enterprise under the investment law 
according to the provisions of the investment law  more energy has elected the alternative benefits track the waiver of grants in return for tax exemption 
as such  more energy s income is tax exempt for a period of two years commencing with the year it first earns taxable income  and subject to corporate taxes at the reduced rate of to  depending upon the level of foreign ownership of the company  for an additional period of years from when the tax exemption ends 
the period of tax benefits  detailed above  is limited to the earlier of years from the commencement of production  or years from the approval date except for the tax exempt period of two years which is unlimited 
due to reported losses for tax purposes  the tax benefit period has not yet commenced 
the entitlement to the above benefits is conditional upon fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the investment law  regulations published thereunder and the letters of approval for the specific investments in approved enterprises 
in the event of failure to comply with these conditions  the benefits may be canceled and more energy may be required to refund the amount of the benefits  in whole or in part  including interest 
as of december   management believes that the company s israeli subsidiary is meeting the aforementioned conditions 
if more energy distributes a cash dividend from retained earnings which were tax exempt due to its approved enterprise status  more energy would be required to pay corporate tax at a rate of to corporate tax on the gross amount distributed and a further withholding tax would be deducted from the amount disturbed to the recipients 
if more energy derives income form sources other than the approved enterprise programs during the relevant period of benefits  this income would be taxable at the regular corporate tax rate of israel 
on april   an amendment to the investment law came into effect the amendment and has significantly changed the provisions of the investment law 
the amendment sets forth the scope of enterprises which may qualify as a privileged enterprise under the amendment  the designation is beneficiary enterprise rather than approved enterprise by setting forth criteria for qualification of a company  such as provisions generally requiring that at least of the beneficiary enterprise s income will be derived from export and that minimum qualifying investments in productive assets be made 
additionally  the amendment enacted major changes in the manner in which tax benefits are awarded under the investment law so that companies no longer require investment center approval in order to qualify for tax benefits 
under the amendment  the year in which the company elects to commence its tax benefits is designated as the year of election year of election 
a company may choose its year of election by notifying the israeli tax authorities in connection with filings its annual tax return or within months after the end of the year of election  whichever is earlier  or by requesting a pre ruling ruling from the israeli tax authorities no later than within months after the end of the year of election 
in july  more energy submitted an application to the investment center for approval to manufacture abroad and still be eligible for all the benefits according the investment law 
the request has not yet been approved 
in august  more energy applied to the israeli tax authorities in order to receive approval for manufacturing in ireland with celestica and to grant the status of industrial enterprise 
a decision regarding the request has not yet been received 
the investment law  as amended  also provides that any letter of approval granted prior to the amendment will remain subject to the terms and benefits included in such letter of approval 
accordingly  while it is anticipated that the investment law  as amended  will govern more energy s beneficiary enterprise terms and benefits  the company does not expect that the amendment will have any impact on medis el 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  stock options and warrants and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we consider accounting policies related to our goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical due to the estimation processes involved and their materiality to our financial statements 
as of december   the net book values of our goodwill and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets arose primarily as a result of three purchase accounting transactions our acquisition of the minority interest in medis inc in  our exchange of our shares for the minority interest in medis el in and our acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own in in amortizing our goodwill through december  and our intangible assets through december   we made estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of such assets 
if our estimates and assumptions change  the useful lives and resulting charges to operations for amortization of such assets would also change 
additionally  with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas no 
requires enterprises  effective january   to discontinue amortizing goodwill  and instead requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
as part of our initial evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for any possible impairment  as of january   we were required to use estimates and assumptions with respect to markets for our products  future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
we have also performed annual tests for impairment of our goodwill for each of the years from  through the estimates we used assume that our products will be accepted and that we will gain market share in the future and will experience growth in such market share 
if we fail to deliver products or to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margins  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if our estimates and or other assumptions change or other circumstances change with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies  we may  in the future  be required to record charges to operations for impairment of our goodwill and or our intangible assets 
stock options  warrants and restricted stock we also consider accounting policies related to stock options  warrants and restricted stock to be critical due to the estimation process involved 
we utilize stock options  warrants and restricted stock as an important means of compensation for employees  directors and consultants and also warrants as an instrument in our fundraising process 
accounting for such options 
warrants and restricted stock  in some circumstances  results in significant non cash charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
there are assumptions and estimates involved in determining the value of such stock options  warrants and restricted stock and the timing of related charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected term of the option  volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
the market price of our stock also has a significant impact on charges we incur related to stock options and warrants 
if these estimates and assumptions change or if our stock price changes  the charges to operations and or accumulated loss could also change significantly 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  and related securities and exchange commission rules included in staff accounting bulletin no 
 on a modified prospective basis 
under this method  compensation cost recognized beginning january  include costs related to all share based payments stock options and restricted stock awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and all share based payments granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation cost for stock options is generally recognized ratably over the vesting period 
during the year ended december  and  we incurred significant non cash charges to operations on grants of stock options to employees and directors as a result of our adoption of sfas r on january  and we expect to continue to incur significant charges in the future 
inventories we consider accounting policies related to inventories to be critical due to the materiality of the amounts and the estimation process involved 
inventories consist of raw materials  components and finished goods and are subject to lower of cost or market valuation and write downs for obsolescence 
application of the appropriate accounting guidance and determining the correct valuation of our inventories involves the use of judgment and estimates 
as such  a significant change in our estimates could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and the results of our operations 
property  plant and equipment we consider accounting policies related to property  plant and equipment and related depreciation to be critical due the materiality of the amounts and the estimation process involved 
determining the amounts of direct incremental costs necessary to bring our production facilities to their intended use and their recoverability requires the application of judgment and the use of estimates  as does determining the estimated useful lives of such facilities 
as such  a significant change in our estimates could have a material impact on the carrying value of our property  plant and equipment and the results of our operations 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
in the event that we were to determine that we are likely to be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any income tax uncertainties 
while our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our december  consolidated financial statements  its application requires the exercise of judgment and the use estimates and  depending on transactions and circumstances  could potentially have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and devaluation on results of operations  liabilities and assets in connection with our currency use  we operate in a mixed environment 
payroll is paid in the local currency of each of our subsidiaries  the new israeli shekel nis  and our other operating expenses and capital expenditures are  for the most part  based in us dollars  nis  euro and swiss francs 
consideration for virtually all sales is either in dollars or dollar linked currency 
as a result  not all monetary assets and all monetary liabilities are linked to the same base in the same amount at all points in time  which cause currency fluctuation related gains or losses 
while our liquid funds are primarily invested in us dollars based assets  we also invest liquid funds in nis  euro and swiss francs 
furthermore  from time to time  we have purchased forward contracts denominated in foreign currencies see discussion of currency risk management below 
for many years prior to  the israeli economy was characterized by high rates of inflation and devaluation of the israeli currency against the united states dollar and other currencies 
since the institution of the israeli economic program in  inflation  while continuing  has been significantly reduced and the rate of devaluation has been substantially diminished 
however  the following table shows the rates of inflation deflation and devaluation appreciation of the nis against the us dollar for the years of through rate of inflation or deflation rate of devaluation or appreciation of the nis against the dollar additionally  in  through january   the rate of inflation in israel zero and the rate of appreciation of the nis was against the dollar 
currency risk management in september   we entered into a capital equipment purchase agreement with komax systems lcf sa formerly know as ismeca europe automation sa to build an automated assembly line for our fuel cell power pack products  to be operated at the galway  ireland facility of celestica 
under the agreement  as amended  we will pay komax an aggregate of approximately  swiss francs approximately  based on currency exchange rates in effect on payment dates and on december  for the remaining balance for constructing the line 
the komax agreement calls for an initial payment of fifteen percent of the total contract price with milestone payments scheduled over the life of the contract 
from the inception of this agreement through december   the company paid komax an aggregate of approximately   swiss francs 
all such amounts are included in property  plant and equipment as of december  based on a study performed by us  we have undertaken a currency risk management strategy for payments under the komax agreement and pursuant to which in we have  on a limited basis  entered into forward contracts and participating forward contracts for the purchase of swiss francs 
at our option  we have either taken delivery of the swiss francs or net settled the contracts during their term 
we also purchase foreign currencies based on projections of up coming payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
through december   we have incurred net costs of approximately  on payments made to date under the komax agreement as a result of variations in the exchange rate between the swiss franc and the us dollar 
as described above  a portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies applicable to our business are the new israeli shekel  the euro and the swiss franc 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
recently  the us dollar has declined in relationship to these foreign currencies  which has increased certain of our operating and capital costs 
continued foreign currency fluctuations could further impact our costs  as well as our ability to achieve and maintain profitability as we continue to grow our business 
impact of political and economic conditions the state of hostility which has existed in varying degrees in israel since  its unfavorable balance of payments and its history of inflation and currency devaluation  all represent uncertainties which may adversely affect our business
