item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles rvs and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our market share in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the industry towables  is approximately 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have a market share of approximately 
our market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we also manufacture and sell foot buses at our facility in southern california designed for that product as well as our existing foot and foot buses 
our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the recreation vehicle industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
we have invested significant capital to modernize  improve and expand our plant facilities and expended  for that purpose in fiscal our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon profitability of the unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  purchasing services  insurance  legal and human resources  risk management  and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 
our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we generally do not directly finance dealers but do provide repurchase agreements in order to facilitate the dealers obtaining floor plan financing 
trends and business outlook industry conditions in the rv market have been adversely affected by record fuel prices  low consumer confidence and tighter lending practices 
as a result of these continuing concerns  market conditions continue to be soft and we anticipate this weakness to continue in fiscal 
table of contents the motorized market has been significantly impacted by current market conditions 
the volatility of fuel prices and the tightening of the retail credit markets are placing pressure on retail sales and our dealers continue to be cautious in the amount of inventory they are willing to carry 
based on the foregoing  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the goodwill associated with a subsidiary within our motorized segment 
our towables market has also softened 
dealers continue to sell older model year units before replacing them with new products 
the decline in wholesale demand has directly impacted our gross margins as we have had to increase our discounts to meet competitive pricing 
when fuel prices stabilize and retail credit availability improves  we expect to see a rebound in sales from dealers ordering units for stock and expect to benefit from our ability to ramp up production in an industry with fewer manufacturing facilities than before  due to competitor failures or plant consolidations 
a longer term positive outlook for the recreation vehicle industry is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales  and an increase in interest in the rv lifestyle among both older and younger segments of the population than have traditionally participated 
we believe an important determinant of demand for recreation vehicles is demographics 
the baby boomer population is now reaching retirement age and retirees are a large market for our products 
the baby boomer retiree population in the united states is expected to grow five times as fast as the total united states population 
we believe a primary indicator of the strength of the recreation vehicle industry is retail rv sales  which we closely monitor to determine industry trends 
recently  although the entire rv industry has been weak  the towable segment of the rv industry has been stronger than the motorized segment 
for the towable segment  retail sales as reported by statistical surveys  inc were down approximately for the seven months ended july  compared with the same period last year 
the motorized segment was down approximately 
higher interest rates  fuel prices  tighter retail credit and lower consumer confidence appear to affect the motorized segment more severely 
economic or industry wide factors affecting our recreation vehicle business include  raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our product 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
additional increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts 
government entities are primary users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore airline travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life and are being continuously replaced by operators 
according to the mid size bus manufacturers association unit sales of small and mid sized buses are down for the six months ended june  compared with the same period last year

financial condition and liquidity as of july   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to  on july  this decrease was primarily due to a reclassification of auction rate securities from short term investments to long term investments 
at july   substantially all investments are comprised of auction rate securities that are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company purchases its auction rate securities at par  and records any unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
cost is determined on the specific identification basis 
interest income is accrued as earned 
at july   we held  par value of long term investments comprised of taxable and tax exempt auction rate securities arss  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every  or days 
the securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semi annually 
at july   substantially all of the arss we held were aaa rated  or equivalent  and none were below aa rated  or equivalent  with most collateralized by student loans and substantially backed by the us federal government 
since february   most auctions have failed for all of these securities and there is no assurance that future auctions on the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed and  as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the par value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
at july   there was insufficient observable ars market information available to determine the fair value of our investments 
therefore  management  assisted by houlihan smith company  inc  an independent consultant  determined an estimated fair value 
in determining the estimate  consideration was given to credit quality  final stated maturities  estimates on the probability of the issue being called prior to final maturity  impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and broker quotes 
based on this analysis  we recorded a cumulative temporary impairment of  related to our ars investments as of july  we believe this temporary impairment is primarily attributable to the limited liquidity of these investments 
we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our arss are presently at risk of default 
through august   we have continued to receive interest payments on the arss in accordance with their terms 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments par value 
due to these recent changes and uncertainty in the ars market  we believe the recovery period for these investments may be longer than twelve months and as a result  we have classified these investments as long term as of july  we currently have the ability and the intent to hold these ars investments until recovery of the auction process or until maturity 

table of contents working capital at july  was  compared to  at july  we have no long term debt 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit which bears interest at negotiated rates below prime and expires on november  there were no borrowings on this line of credit during the year ended july  the loan agreement executed in connection with the line of credit contains certain covenants  including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we believe that internally generated funds and the line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current needs and any additional capital requirements 
capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal year ended july  were primarily for planned expansions and improvements of  at our recreation vehicle facilities and  for our bus operations 
we paid a special dividend in fiscal totaling  we also bought back  shares of thor common stock in fiscal at a total cost of  the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately  these expenditures will be made primarily for replacement and upgrading of machinery  equipment and other assets to be used in the ordinary course of business 
critical accounting principles the consolidated financial statements of thor are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets we at least annually review the carrying value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives 
long lived assets  identifiable intangibles that are amortized  goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
this review is performed primarily using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair values could affect the evaluations 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported  and changes in the reserves 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator and actuary using various state statutes and reserve requirements and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a reserve on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data and actuarial information 
we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all our self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
warranty we provide customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate  however actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserves are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in the first quarter of  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of recreation vehicles and buses are recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from the company s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
certain shipments are sold to customers on credit or cash on delivery cod terms 
the company recognizes revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  the company receives payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments it is customary practice for companies in the recreation vehicle industry to enter into repurchase agreements with financing institutions to provide financing to their dealers 
generally  these agreements provide for the repurchase of products from the financing institution in the event of a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and further reduced by the resale value of the units which the company would be required to repurchase 
losses under these agreements have not been significant in the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  and management believes that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records repurchase and guarantee reserves based on prior experience and known current events 

table of contents principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other off balance sheet commitments 
contractual payments due by period obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after years operating leases consigned inventory unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations we have included in unrecognized tax benefits  approximately  for payments expected to be made in fiscal unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of approximately  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payment

sfas will be effective for thor s fiscal year beginning august  we believe the adoption of sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after december  this standard will significantly change the accounting for business acquisitions both during the period of the acquisition and in subsequent periods 
among the more significant changes in the accounting for acquisitions are the following transaction costs  many of which are currently treated as costs of the acquisition  will generally be expensed 
in process research and development will be accounted for as an asset  with the cost recognized as the research and development is realized or abandoned 
these costs are currently expensed at the time of the acquisition 
contingencies  including contingent consideration  will generally be recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations 
contingent consideration is currently accounted for as an adjustment of the purchase price 
decreases in valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets will be recognized in operations 
previously such changes were considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and were recorded as decreases in goodwill 
the effects of implementing sfas r on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows will depend on future acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency related to its operations in canada 
however  because of the size of canadian operations  a hypothetical change in the canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar would not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
