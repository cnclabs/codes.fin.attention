item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  panacos or the company  seeks to develop next generation anti infective products through the discovery and development of small molecule oral drugs designed to treat human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  and other major human viral diseases 
we focus on disease indications where we believe there is a clear unmet medical need and commercial opportunity for more effective therapies 
we believe that a major potential commercial advantage of the hiv market is the shorter clinical development and product review times that have usually preceded the approval of currently marketed hiv drugs than is generally the case for many other disease indications  such as cardiovascular disease 
because it is widely established that the most important problem in treating hiv is the emergence of viral strains that are resistant to currently approved drugs  our proprietary discovery technologies focus on novel targets in the virus life cycle  including virus maturation and virus fusion 
our lead product candidate  bevirimat  is an oral hiv drug candidate in phase clinical testing 
to date  we have dosed over patients and subjects with bevirimat and have seen a good safety and tolerability profile with no indication of a relationship between adverse events and drug levels 
bevirimat is the first in a new class of product candidates that works by a novel mechanism of action called maturation inhibition that is different from the mechanism of any currently approved drugs 
this new target for hiv drugs was discovered by panacos scientists and their academic collaborators 
based on currently available clinical data  we believe that bevirimat has the potential to be a part of combination therapy for both treatment experienced and treatment na ve previously untreated patients with hiv 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  has granted fast track designation to bevirimat 
fast track designation may be granted to a drug under development when the fda determines that the specific indication for which the product candidate is being studied is serious or life threatening and that the product candidate demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for that indication 
we have retained worldwide commercialization rights to bevirimat 
in august  we announced the completion of a phase a clinical trial of bevirimat  and provided analysis of the results 
the trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the level of hiv in the blood  known as viral load  or vl  in patients treated with bevirimat monotherapy compared to placebo 
after ten days of the highest dose of an oral solution of bevirimat in the trial  the median reduction in vl was log  or a decrease 
in june  we initiated a phase b clinical trial  which we refer to as study  of bevirimat at multiple clinical sites in the us in this trial  bevirimat was administered to hiv positive treatment experienced patients failing their current treatment regimen 
all patients received one of several bevirimat doses or placebo in combination with approved hiv drugs 
the primary objective of this trial was to determine an optimal dose or 
table of contents doses of bevirimat for use in pivotal clinical trials 
the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was vl reduction after two weeks of bevirimat dosing on top of a patient s failing drug regimens so called functional monotherapy 
additional planned endpoints of this trial were to include safety and pharmacokinetics after two weeks and twelve weeks  as well as vl reduction after twelve weeks of dosing with bevirimat 
in december  we announced preliminary results from the first cohort of study of bevirimat  which studied a mg bevirimat dose comprising eight mg tablets  a prototype formulation designed to maximize flexibility in dosing increments 
the results of this cohort confirmed the antiviral activity of bevirimat shown in previous studies  but the bevirimat levels in the blood or plasma concentrations were lower than expected 
based on data available at the time  we initiated additional work to improve the bevirimat tablet formulation  and we re introduced an earlier liquid formulation that had been successful in clinical trials into study to allow the study to meet its original dose finding objective 
in march  the fda agreed to our plan for a revised trial design which is now designated as part b of study and we resumed bevirimat dose escalation in study while continuing to develop an optimized formulation of bevirimat for late stage clinical development and commercialization 
the dose escalation stage of part b of study was recently completed and tested the efficacy of bevirimat in treatment experienced patients failing current therapy  at increasing doses using the oral liquid formulation which was utilized in study this part b stage of study involved a day functional monotherapy period similar to the first study cohort  except that patients did not continue on to extended dosing 
in study  bevirimat was well tolerated  has shown generally dose proportional increases in plasma concentration  and in many patients has been associated with a vl reduction of more than log 
following days of functional monotherapy 
detailed analyses of the data suggest that treatment experienced patients may be grouped into two populations responders and non responders 
responders may be defined as those patients with at least a log 
vl reduction by week and non responders as those with less than a log 
vl reduction by this time point 
the mean vl change in responders was generally consistent across all of the doses tested in study based on the data  supported by updated pharmacokinetic modeling  we believe that doses used in study are in the optimum response range the peak of the dose response curve and that further dose escalation will not provide significantly improved responses 
accordingly  we do not plan to undertake any further dose escalation in study we are studying the distinctions between responders and non responders  including both clinical and virologic variables  in order to be able to focus bevirimat treatment on patients who will benefit most from bevirimat 
based on analyses to date  it appears that one factor differentiating responder patients from non responder patients are differences in the viruses from these two groups of patients 
there are variations in the viral amino acid sequences that are significantly more common in hiv from non responders as compared to responders 
laboratory data suggest that some of these amino acid changes  or polymorphisms  may affect the ability of bevirimat to inhibit hiv replication 
we plan to prospectively confirm that patients without these polymorphisms are significantly more likely to respond to bevirimat treatment 
we are conducting extensive testing in order to define this patient population with the goal of developing a diagnostic assay that can be used to select patients for future clinical trials 
we also plan to conduct extended dosing studies of bevirimat in we have established research and development programs designed to generate second and third generation maturation inhibition products 
we believe that there is the potential for multiple marketed products in this class 
we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  for one of our second generation maturation inhibitors  pa  and completed a phase clinical trial for that compound 
we do not plan to study pa further in clinical trials 
we envision studying additional second generation maturation inhibitors in preclinical and single dose human clinical trials before choosing a compound for multiple dose clinical trials 
the selection of second generation compounds to move forward into development will be based in part on the results of studies to determine whether any second generation compounds may have activity in patients who do not respond well to bevirimat 

table of contents we also have a research and development program focused on an early step in the hiv virus life cycle  fusion of the hiv virus to human cells 
fusion inhibition is a novel target for oral drug development 
panacos scientists have developed proprietary drug screening technology to identify inhibitors of virus fusion and have used this screening technology successfully to identify novel small molecule hiv fusion inhibitors 
ongoing optimization of these compounds resulted in our identification of a lead compound  pa  suitable for moving forward into preclinical safety studies 
the only approved hiv fusion inhibitor  enfuvirtide  is a peptide drug which is expensive to manufacture and is administered by injection 
we have retained the worldwide commercialization rights to all of our programs 
we believe that we could potentially develop bevirimat and market it in north america successfully without a strategic corporate collaboration because we anticipate that the north american hiv market could be addressed with a relatively small sales force of approximately representatives 
we are  however  also exploring corporate collaboration opportunities to facilitate the development and commercialization of bevirimat 
we are also exploring corporate collaboration opportunities for our oral fusion program 
we intend to evaluate the relative merits of both approaches on an ongoing basis 
company background in march  vi technologies  inc merged with panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  a company incorporated in as a subsidiary of the public company boston biomedica inc and spun off as an independent private company in for accounting purposes  the merger was considered a reverse merger under which the former panacos was considered the acquirer of vi technologies 
accordingly  all financial information prior to the merger date reflects the historical financial results of the former panacos 
the former panacos was founded to develop small molecule therapeutics for hiv and other serious viral infections 
following the merger  the combined company was known as vi technologies  inc until the name was changed to panacos pharmaceuticals  inc in august prior to the march merger  the inactine pathogen reduction system for red blood cells was vi technologies principal development stage program 
we have since terminated the development program for the inactine system 
we were organized under the laws of the state of delaware in december our principal executive offices are located at coolidge avenue  watertown  massachusetts  and our telephone number is our website address is www

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following research and development revenue and cost recognition most of our revenues have been generated by research contracts and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from research contracts are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed and the reimbursable costs are incurred 
we are a development stage enterprise and no revenues to date have been derived from our principal operations 

table of contents we are reimbursed for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants and awards 
we record the amount of reimbursement as grant revenue as the services are provided 
provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period when such losses can be determined 
accrued expenses related to research and development programs as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying yet to be invoiced services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include services we obtain from contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials  contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies  and consulting fees 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status  timing and billing of services provided 
although our service providers generally invoice us in arrears for services performed  contract agreements may contain prepayment provisions  which we record in a prepaid account  and offset those amounts when we subsequently incur costs related to those prepayments 
contracts vary significantly in length and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at certain limits  or a combination of any of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through communication with vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion reviews  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  and pre approval of any changes in scope of the services being performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period could be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
there have been no changes in our estimation methodology for accruing contract services fees that had a material effect on our net losses for any of the periods presented herein 
long lived assets our long lived assets  which currently consist of property and equipment  are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line method over their economic life  which ranges from three to ten years 
we amortized acquired intangible assets workforce using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of four years 
determining the lives of our long lived assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our results of operations 
asset impairments we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in our business or industry  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance were to exist  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group of assets exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
use of different estimates and judgments on any of these factors could yield materially different results in our analysis and could result in significantly different asset impairment charges 
at december   our remaining long lived assets consisted of net property and equipment totaling approximately million 
in june  we recognized an impairment and contract related charge of million  of which approximately  related to the write off of the net book value of leasehold improvements and lab equipment pertaining to the vacancy and sublease for a portion of our watertown facility that was vacated as a result of the termination of the inactine program 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an additional impairment and contract related charge of  related to the sublease 
contingencies contingencies are addressed by assessing the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances  seeking outside professional advice of lawyers or accountants  where appropriate  and then making and recording our best judgment of potential loss under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this process is repeated in each reporting period as circumstances evolve and are reevaluated 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates that impact our estimates of loss will be recorded in operations immediately in the period of the change 
share based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas r  effective january   which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases  restricted stock and other equity awards based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  for periods prior to in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas r 
for further information  please see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this determination is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected life of the award and a risk free interest rate 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior  adjusted for known trends  to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
we update these assumptions on a quarterly basis to reflect recent historical data 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock based awards 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year as compared to fiscal year revenues fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease revenues decreased by to  in compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to lower research funding on our existing contract with the university of north carolina and the completion of work under several national institute of health  or nih  grant funded projects in the decrease was partly offset by the recognition of a  nonrefundable license fee in the second quarter of related to the inactine technology development program  which was discontinued in research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million  total research and development spending increased by  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in compared to is primarily due to increased spending on the bevirimat development program  partly offset by lower spending on our pipeline second generation maturation inhibitor and fusion programs 
non cash stock compensation expense accounted for million and  of research and development expenses in and  respectively 
general and administrative fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease in was primarily due to non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million recognized during the second quarter of relating to the accelerated vesting of options held by our former ceo  dr 
samuel ackerman  upon his death pursuant to the terms of his option grants and employment agreement 
partly offsetting this decrease was an increase in general and administrative expenses in related to marketing  business development and intellectual property activities 
non cash stock compensation expense accounted for million and million of general and administrative expense in and  respectively 
impairment and contract related charges we recognized an impairment and contract related charge of million in the charge related to the vacancy and sublease for a portion of our watertown facility  which had been used for the inactine program that was discontinued and to the write off and disposition of certain fixed assets associated with the sublease 
interest income fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million  
table of contents interest income decreased by  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower average cash and investment balances available to fund our operations in and to lower interest rates generated within our portfolio near the end of interest expense fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million  million the majority of interest expense recognized in resulted from our loan balance with hercules  which we entered into during the second quarter of interest expense on the loan with hercules  which is based on the prime rate on the dates of advance plus  was for the first million received in june upon the signing of the agreement and for the second million installment received in october the hercules loan allows for interest only payments on a monthly basis until july  which could be extended to october if we satisfy certain milestones as set forth in the loan agreement 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year revenues fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease  million  revenues decreased by to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower nih grant funding and the completion of work under several nih grant funded projects during revenues for both years consisted entirely of grant revenue and subcontractor services fees 
research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million total research and development spending increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased spending on the bevirimat development program  which entered phase b clinical trials during the second quarter of  and to our pipeline second generation maturation inhibitor and fusion programs 
non cash stock compensation expense relating to the adoption of sfas r in accounted for  of research and development expense in this compares to million in non cash stock compensation charges recorded in  of which million resulted from the departure of an executive officer late in general and administrative fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during from million for the most important factor contributing to this increase was a million charge resulting from the sudden and unexpected death of our former chief executive officer  samuel k 
ackerman  md  in june included in the million charge was a non cash stock compensation charge of approximately million relating to the accelerated vesting of dr 
ackerman s options upon his death  pursuant to the terms of his option grants and employment agreement and  for other compensation expenses 
a significant portion 
table of contents of the remaining amount of the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributed to share based compensation expenses of million relating to the adoption of sfas r in this compares to stock compensation charges of  in also contributing to the growth in general and administrative expenses in was an increase in marketing  business development and intellectual property activities and the increase in public company infrastructure following the merger in in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of vi technologies in  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million during the first quarter of the amount allocated to in process research and development represented an estimate of the fair value of a purchased in process technology research project that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the in process research and development primarily represented the estimated fair value of inactine  a vi technologies system for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells 
the initial value of the purchased in process research and development from the merger of million was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products based upon management s estimates of future revenues and operating profits to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value and were then adjusted by a probability of success factor 
the final fair value of million included a pro rata allocation of the excess purchase price of approximately million 
in process research and development was expensed immediately upon the consummation of the merger 
there were no in process research and development charges in impairment charges we recorded two impairment charges of million and million in the first quarter of and second quarter of  respectively  resulting in a combined charge of million for the first charge of million consisted of million and million on the property and equipment and the workforce intangible asset balances recorded upon consummation of the merger  respectively 
upon the closing of the merger  we completed an analysis to determine if we were able to recover the adjusted value of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determined that the carrying value of our long lived assets property and equipment and workforce exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets and workforce  and therefore  wrote down the estimates to the estimated fair values 
the million charge recorded during the second quarter of followed the announcement in june of our discontinuance of the inactine program  which consisted of  and million on the inactine specific property and equipment and workforce intangible asset balances  respectively  in accordance with sfas no 
interest income fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million  million interest income increased by million  or  to million in from  in the net increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher average cash and investment balances and higher interest rates in compared to the higher cash and investment balances were directly attributed to proceeds received from the public offering that was completed in october interest expense fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease 
table of contents interest expense decreased by  or  to  in from  in the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from the termination of the capital lease obligations  which ended in early liquidity and capital resources we continue to finance our operations primarily through sales of our securities and debt financing 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  public offerings of common stock  grant and subcontract revenue  and short and long term debt and capital lease financing 
in june  we entered into a million term loan agreement with hercules 
pursuant to the loan agreement  hercules advanced us million on june   and we received the second million tranche from hercules in october at december   we had combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million in comparison with cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million on december  we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we move our lead compound  bevirimat  and our second generation maturation inhibitors through further clinical trials  and as we increase our preclinical efforts for our fusion inhibitor program 
based on our current forecasts  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into our cash activity during the fiscal years and was comprised of the following in thousands net cash used in operating activities redemption or sale purchase of available for sale marketable securities  net cash used in fixed asset acquisitions net proceeds from equity transactions proceeds from borrowing on notes payable net proceeds from the issuance of debt and warrants repayment of advances and other debt transfers from restricted cash increase decrease in cash position we intend to explore strategic relationships as one means to provide resources for further development of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast when or whether we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements on favorable terms 
we expect to continue to have  for the foreseeable future  substantial cash requirements annually 
the level of cash resources required will depend on the continuing progress of clinical trials for bevirimat  on the expenditures required to develop our other product candidates and on expenditures on our research programs 
we plan to fund operations primarily through a combination of cash on hand  marketable securities  additional issuances of our equity or debt securities and partnerships for the clinical development of product candidates  such as bevirimat 
development partnerships can include license fees and reimbursement of the cost to conduct clinical trials required to commercialize the product in return for distribution rights following approval of the product by regulatory authorities 
we filed a shelf registration statement on form s in the first quarter of with the sec 
the registration statement registration statement no 
was declared effective by the sec in may and allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell equity securities up to an aggregate value of approximately million 
the aggregate amount available on our shelf registration statement reflects a reduction from the original amount available due to the registration of the warrant  and the  shares of common stock underlying the warrant  issued to hercules in connection with the million term loan agreement 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain funding  secure additional grants  or enter into 
table of contents commercial partnerships sufficient to fund our operations 
other than proceeds from financings  partnerships and grants  we do not anticipate generating cash flow from operations until the commercial launch of bevirimat in major markets  such as the us or europe 
no assurance can be given as to when  if ever  such commercial launch will occur 
contractual obligations the following table represents our outstanding contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases  net of sublease capital lease term loan hercules note payable other purchase obligations total includes principal only  no interest payments off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf concludes that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the initial adjustment to reflect the effect of applying the consensus as a change in accounting principle would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our overall financial position or results of operations 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas permits all entities to choose  at specified dates  to measure eligible items at fair value 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our overall financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the pronouncement clarifies the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is applicable as of january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our overall financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as of january  the adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as of the date of adoption and as of december   we have recorded no reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
the statute of limitations for tax audit is generally open for the years and later 
however  we are a development stage pharmaceutical company which has incurred net operating losses since inception 
such loss carryforwards would be subject to audit in any tax year in which those losses are carried and applied  notwithstanding the year of origin 
our policy is to recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense 
we have recorded no such expense 
we do not anticipate any material changes in the amount of unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to us government issues  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the fair market value of our total portfolio at december
