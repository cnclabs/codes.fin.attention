item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and we also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to volatile product costs by short term pricing arrangements  rather than long term fixed price supply arrangements 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  and when market conditions relating to our supply arrangements and risk management activities are favorable  as was the case in the propane and fuel oil markets during the first half of fiscal  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the spot market 
however  such favorable market conditions and margin opportunities were not present in fiscal rather  very challenging market conditions in fiscal  characterized by an extreme rise in commodity prices particularly during the third quarter coupled with lower volumes resulted in the recognition of realized losses under our hedging and risk management activities which were not fully offset by the sales of the physical inventory as more fully described under hedging and risk management activities below 
to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  in periods of sustained higher commodity prices  as has been experienced over the past several fiscal years  retail sales volumes have been negatively impacted by customer conservation efforts 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because of the primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 

table of contents weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption 
hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward and option agreements with third parties  and use fuel oil futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex  to purchase and sell propane and fuel oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and option agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory  as well as  in certain instances  forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil 
forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract and futures are generally settled in cash at the expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management and reporting to our auditing committee  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy 
as a result of various market factors during the first half of fiscal  particularly commodity price volatility during the first four months of the fiscal year  we experienced additional margin opportunities due to favorable pricing under certain supply arrangements and from our hedging and risk management activities 
these market conditions generated additional operating profit of approximately million during fiscal compared to fiscal supply and risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins and there can be no assurance that the favorable market conditions that contributed to incremental margin during the first half of fiscal will be present in the future in order to provide the additional margin opportunities 
very different and challenging factors existed in fiscal in fact  as a result of the rise in commodity prices in fiscal  particularly during the third quarter  we realized losses under our futures positions utilized to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our priced physical inventory 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on futures contracts will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices 
however  as a result of lower than expected volumes primarily attributable to customer conservation  the timing was such that these losses were not fully offset by sales of the physical product 
accordingly  our risk management activities had a negative effect on earnings of approximately million during fiscal as a result of realized losses on futures contracts that were not fully offset by sales of physical product 
see item a of this annual report for a further discussion of risk management activities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
as a result of our large customer base  which is comprised of more than  customers  no individual customer account is material 
therefore  while some variation to actual results occurs  historically such variability has not been material 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
with other assumptions held constant  an increase of basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs and an increase of basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs 
with other assumptions held constant  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs and a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs 

table of contents self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
historically  we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly  and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of  in particular  product liability claims  the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates 
however  because of the nature of our insurance arrangements  those material variations historically have not  nor are they expected in the future to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
results of operations and financial condition fiscal presented a challenging operating environment characterized by a volatile commodity price environment  continued customer conservation  relatively mild temperatures during the peak winter heating season and a general slowdown in the economy 
however  the steps taken by us over the past several years to streamline our operating platform  drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs have helped to mitigate the potential negative effect on our operating results and financial position from these external factors 
net income for fiscal amounted to million  or per common unit  an increase of million  or  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in fiscal ebitda as defined and reconciled below increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal from a cash flow perspective  despite the sustained period of high commodity prices  we continue to fund working capital requirements from cash on hand and have not borrowed under our working capital facility since april in the current period of uncertainty surrounding the credit markets  we ended fiscal in a strong cash position with more than million of cash on hand  which we expect will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future without an immediate need to access the capital markets 
based on our financial strength  our fiscal earnings and our confidence in our operating platform  on october   our board of supervisors increased the annualized distribution rate by per common unit to per common unit  an increase of compared to the annualized distribution rate of at the end of fiscal revenues of  million increased million  or  compared to the prior year due to higher average selling prices associated with higher product costs  partially offset by lower volumes 
retail propane gallons sold for fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in both segments were attributable to ongoing customer conservation resulting from historically high commodity prices  warmer average temperatures during the peak heating months from october through march and  to a lesser extent  the effects of eliminating certain lower margin accounts 
average heating degree days in our service territories were of normal for fiscal and flat compared to the prior year  however  the winter heating season of fiscal was warmer than the comparable prior year period  particularly in the northeast where average heating degree days were below normal and the prior year  thus contributing to the lower volumes 

table of contents in the commodities markets  average posted prices for propane and fuel oil during fiscal were and higher  respectively  compared to fiscal costs of products sold increased million  or  to  million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily resulting from the rise in commodity prices 
as reported throughout much of the prior year  favorable market conditions impacting the supply and pricing structure for propane and fuel oil provided approximately million of incremental margin opportunities in fiscal  which were not present in fiscal in addition  with the dramatic rise in commodity prices  particularly during the third quarter of fiscal  we reported realized losses from risk management activities that were not fully offset by sales of the physical product  resulting in a negative effect of approximately million on fiscal earnings 
costs of products sold for fiscal also included a million unrealized non cash gain attributable to the mark to market on certain risk management activities  compared to a million unrealized non cash loss in the prior year 
the favorable trend experienced in operating and general and administrative expenses resulting from our efforts to drive efficiencies and reduce costs continued throughout fiscal combined operating and general and administrative expenses of million decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
the most significant cost savings were experienced in payroll and benefit related expenses resulting from a lower headcount and lower variable compensation in line with lower earnings  once adjusted for the significant items described below 
in addition  we achieved a modest reduction in costs to operate our fleet as a result of a lower vehicle count and route efficiencies  which more than offset the impact of a dramatic rise in diesel costs 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included a gain reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale of our tirzah  south carolina underground propane storage cavern and associated mile pipeline  which occurred during october net income and ebitda for fiscal included i a non cash pension settlement charge of million to accelerate the recognition of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the level of lump sum retirement benefit payments made during fiscal  ii severance charges of million related to positions eliminated in fiscal  iii a million gain from the recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with our successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina  and iv gains reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale and exchange of customer service centers considered to be non strategic 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and iii assuming distributions remain at the current level  approximately million of distributions to common unitholders 
based on our current cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
based on our current forecast of working capital requirements for fiscal  we currently do not expect to borrow under the working capital facility in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues dollars in thousands percent fiscal fiscal increase increase decrease decrease revenues propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity services all other total revenues total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september   due to higher average selling prices associated with higher product costs  partially offset by lower volumes 
volumes in our propane  fuel oil and refined fuels and natural gas and electricity segments were lower in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to ongoing customer conservation resulting from the historically high commodity prices  proactive steps to manage customer credit risk  warmer weather in our service territories during the peak heating months and  to a lesser extent  the effects of eliminating certain lower margin accounts which occurred throughout much of the prior year 
from a weather perspective  average heating degree days in our service territories were of normal for fiscal and flat compared to the prior year  however  the winter heating season of fiscal was warmer than the comparable prior year period  particularly in the northeast where average heating degree days were below normal and the prior year  thus having a negative effect on volumes 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of  million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to  million for the year ended september   primarily due to higher average selling prices  partially offset by lower volumes 
retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year  while our average propane selling prices during fiscal increased approximately compared to the prior year 
additionally  revenues from wholesale and other propane activities for the year ended september  decreased million compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  from million in the prior year  primarily due to higher average selling prices  partially offset by lower volumes 
fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable to the impact of ongoing customer conservation from continued high energy prices combined with our decision to exit certain lower margin diesel and gasoline businesses 
our decision to exit the majority of our low sulfur diesel and gasoline businesses resulted in a reduction in volumes in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment of approximately million gallons  or of the total volume decline in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the average posted price of fuel oil during fiscal increased approximately compared to the average posted prices in the prior year  while our average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increased approximately compared to the prior year period 

table of contents revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher average selling prices for both electricity and natural gas  partially offset by lower electricity and natural gas volumes 
revenues in our services segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year as a result of the decision to reduce the level of certain installation activities 
the focus of our ongoing service offerings are in support of our existing core commodity segments 
cost of products sold dollars in thousands percent fiscal fiscal increase increase decrease decrease cost of products sold propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity services all other total cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane and fuel oil sold  as well as the cost of natural gas and electricity  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
unrealized non cash gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold 
cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold in fiscal included a million unrealized non cash gain representing the net unrealized change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period  compared to a million unrealized non cash loss in the prior year resulting in a decrease of million in cost of products sold for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher average propane costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the impact of the sharp increase in commodity prices was partially offset by lower propane volumes which resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
lower wholesale and other propane revenues  noted above  decreased cost of products sold by approximately million compared to the prior year 
in addition  the portion of the total net change in the fair value of derivative instruments associated with the propane segment during fiscal  noted above  resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher average fuel oil costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year period 
this increase was partially offset by lower fuel oil sales volumes  which resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  as described above  risk management activities during fiscal resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold compared to the prior year as a result of realized losses on futures contracts that were not fully offset by sales of physical product 
the portion of the total net change in the fair value of derivative instruments associated with the fuel oil and refined fuels segment during the period resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold compared to the prior year 

table of contents cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year due to higher average electricity costs and  to a lesser extent  natural gas costs 
cost of products sold in our services segment of million decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes 
for the year ended september   total cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the significant increase in product costs which we were not able to fully pass on to customers  as well as the favorable market conditions discussed above that contributed approximately million of incremental margin opportunities in the prior year that were not present in fiscal and the negative effect of higher commodity prices on our risk management activities which resulted in million of realized losses during the second half of fiscal that were not fully offset by sales of physical product 
operating expenses dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease operating expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers 
operating expenses of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year as a result of our continued efforts to drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs across all operating segments 
payroll and benefit related expenses declined million due to lower headcount  as well as lower variable compensation associated with lower earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  vehicle expenditures decreased million compared to the prior year  despite a significant increase in the cost of diesel fuel  as a result of a lower vehicle count enabled by ongoing routing efficiencies 
savings from payroll and benefit related expenses and vehicle expenditures were partially offset by higher bad debt expense and increased costs to operate our customer service centers in the high energy price environment 

table of contents general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in variable compensation resulting from lower earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year and the reduction of compensation costs recognized under certain long term incentive plans 
restructuring charges and severance costs we did not record any restructuring charges for the year ended september  for the year ended september   we recorded a charge of million primarily related to employee termination costs incurred as a result of further refinements to our plan to restructure our services segment 
depreciation and amortization dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended september  was relatively unchanged compared to the prior year 
interest expense  net dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase interest expense  net as a percent of total revenues net interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower market interest rates for short term investments  which contributed to less interest income earned 
as has been the case since april  there were no borrowings under our working capital facility as seasonal working capital needs have been funded through cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
we ended fiscal in a strong cash position with million in cash on the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents discontinued operations on october   the operating partnership completed the sale of its tirzah  south carolina underground granite propane storage cavern  and associated mile pipeline  for approximately million in cash  after taking into account certain adjustments 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a long term storage arrangement  not to exceed million propane gallons  with the purchaser of the cavern that will enable us to continue to meet the needs of our retail operations  consistent with past practices 
as a result of this sale  we reported a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal the results of operations from the tirzah facilities have been reported within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and the assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  during the first quarter of fiscal  in a non cash transaction  we disposed of nine customer service centers considered to be non strategic in exchange for three customer service centers of another company located in alaska 
we reported a million gain within discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal for the amount by which the fair value of assets relinquished exceeded the carrying value of the assets relinquished 
during fiscal we also sold three customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million and reported a gain on sale within discontinued operations of million 
net income and ebitda we reported net income of million  or per common unit  for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year 
ebitda for fiscal of million increased million  or  compared to ebitda of million in the prior year 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included a gain reported within discontinued operations of million from our sale of its tirzah  south carolina underground storage cavern and associated mile pipeline 
by comparison  net income and ebitda for fiscal included i the non cash pension settlement charge of million  ii severance costs of million related to positions eliminated  iii a gain of million from the recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with the successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina  iv gains reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale and exchange of customer service centers considered to be non strategic  and v a non cash adjustment to the provision for income taxes of million 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we disclose it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
in addition  certain of our incentive compensation plans covering executives and other employees utilize ebitda as the performance target 
we use this non gaap financial measure in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity on a year over year basis 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies

retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
propane volumes sold were negatively affected by customer conservation efforts  and our effort to focus on higher margin residential customers 
average propane selling prices increased year over year as a result of higher commodity prices for propane and a more favorable customer mix 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million for the year ended september   which decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower risk management activity in the continued high price environment

fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable primarily to our continued efforts to exit certain lower margin gasoline and low sulfur diesel businesses which resulted in an approximate decrease of million gallons  or of the total volume decline compared to the prior year 
average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increased as a result of the decreased emphasis on lower priced gasoline and diesel businesses 
the average posted price of fuel oil during fiscal decreased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year  yet increased sharply during september compared to the prior year 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity marketing segment decreased million  or  to million in fiscal primarily from lower volumes and lower average selling prices for both natural gas and electricity 
revenues in our services segment declined  to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the decision during the third quarter of fiscal to reorganize the services segment and to reduce the level of stand alone installation activities

in fiscal  we realized the full year effect of the operating efficiencies  lower headcount and lower vehicle count resulting from our field and services reorganizations that began at the end of the third quarter of fiscal and continued into the beginning of fiscal the most significant cost savings were experienced in payroll and benefit related expenses which declined million  as well as a decrease of million in vehicle expenditures and savings in other costs of million to operate our customer service centers 
these cost savings were offset to an extent by a million increase in variable compensation resulting from the improved earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  fiscal operating expenses include a non cash pension settlement charge of million  which was million lower than the prior year charge of million  in order to accelerate the recognition of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the level of lump sum retirement benefit payments made during each of the respective fiscal years 

table of contents general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  were million  or  lower compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional services fees incurred in the prior year associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   as well as million in higher costs incurred in the prior year associated with our field realignment effort 
the reduction in professional services fees also includes a million gain from our recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with our successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina 
these cost savings were offset to an extent by a million increase in variable compensation resulting from the improved earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
restructuring charges and severance costs for the year ended september   we recorded a charge of million related to severance costs incurred associated with positions eliminated during fiscal unrelated to a specific plan of restructuring 
for the year ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge of million related primarily to severance costs incurred to effectuate our field realignment and services restructuring initiatives during fiscal depreciation and amortization dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower amortization expense on intangible assets that have been fully amortized  coupled with lower depreciation from asset retirements 
fiscal depreciation and amortization expense included a million asset impairment charge associated with our field realignment efforts  as well as the write down of certain assets 

table of contents interest expense  net dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent decrease decrease interest expense  net as a percent of total revenues net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal during fiscal  there were no borrowings under our working capital facility as seasonal working capital needs have been funded through improved cash flow and cash on hand  resulting in lower interest expense 
in the prior year period  average borrowings under our working capital facility amounted to million with a peak borrowing level of million 
additionally  as a result of increased cash on hand  interest income on invested cash has increased compared to the prior year  thus reducing net interest expense 
discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal  in a non cash transaction  we completed a transaction in which we disposed of nine customer service centers considered to be non strategic in exchange for three customer service centers of another company located in alaska 
we reported a million gain within discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal for the amount by which the fair value of assets relinquished exceeded the carrying value of the assets relinquished 
as part of our overall business strategy  we continually monitor and evaluate existing operations in order to identify opportunities to optimize return on assets by selectively divesting operations in slower growing or non strategic markets 
during fiscal  we also sold three customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million and recorded a gain on sale of million which has been accounted for in accordance with sfas net income and ebitda we reported net income of million  or per common unit  for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year 
ebitda for fiscal of million increased million  or  compared to ebitda of million in the prior year 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included i the non cash pension settlement charge of million  ii severance costs of million related to positions eliminated  iii a gain of million from the recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with the successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina  iv gains reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale and exchange of customer service centers considered to be non strategic  and v a non cash adjustment to the provision for income taxes deferred taxes of million 
by comparison  ebitda and net income for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance benefits associated with our field realignment and the restructuring of our services business  ii incremental professional services fees of million associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million  iv a charge of million within cost of products sold to reduce the carrying value of service inventory that will no longer be marketed by our customer service centers  and v million included within depreciation and amortization expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment

net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of the net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million and the net proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations 
capital spending in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower spending on tanks and information technology as much of the incremental spending on our field realignment efforts has been incurred 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment and proceeds from the sale of certain customer service centers of million 
capital spending in fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of spending on information technology to finalize the integration of systems from the agway acquisition  as well as the timing of capital spending for our field realignment efforts  particularly to integrate certain customer service center locations

on september  we made a prepayment of million on the term loan thereby reducing the amount outstanding to million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the working capital facility as of september  and there have been no borrowings under our working capital facility since april we have standby letters of credit issued under the working capital facility of the revolving credit agreement in the aggregate amount of million in support of retention levels under our self insurance programs and certain lease obligations which expire periodically through october  therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the working capital facility of the revolving credit agreement 
additionally  under the revolving credit agreement our operating partnership is authorized to incur additional indebtedness of up to million in connection with capital leases and up to million in short term borrowings during the period from december to april in each fiscal year in order to meet working capital needs during periods of peak demand  if necessary 
because of our cash position  operating results and cash flow  we did not make any such short term borrowings during fiscal the senior notes mature on december  and require semi annual interest payments 
we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the senior notes 
in addition  the senior notes have a change of control provision that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount repurchased  if the holders of the notes elected to exercise the right of repurchase 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  including the term loan  bear interest at a rate based upon libor plus an applicable margin 
an annual facility fee ranging from to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 

table of contents in connection with the term loan  our operating partnership also entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million with the issuing lender 
in connection with the million prepayment of the term loan on september   we also amended the interest rate swap contract to reduce the notional amount by million 
from an original borrowing date of march  through march   our operating partnership paid or will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender paid or will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the applicable margin above libor  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  will be paid in addition to this fixed interest rate of 
under the revolving credit agreement  our operating partnership must maintain a leverage ratio the ratio of total debt to ebitda of less than to and an interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to interest expense of greater than to at the partnership level 
under the senior note indenture  we are generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash  as defined  as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter  if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions  and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is greater than to under the revolving credit agreement  as long as no default exists or would result  the partnership is permitted to make cash distributions not more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed available cash  as defined  for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership and us  respectively 
these covenants include i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of all of our debt agreements as of september  and september  under the revolving credit agreement  proceeds from the sale  transfer or other disposition of any asset of the operating partnership  other than the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business  in excess of million must be used to acquire productive assets within twelve months of receipt of the proceeds 
any proceeds not used within twelve months of receipt to acquire productive assets must be used to prepay the outstanding principal of the term loan 
as noted above  we prepaid million of the term loan on september  with the remaining available proceeds from the sale of our tirzah storage facility that were not expected to be used to acquire productive assets within twelve months of receipt 
an additional million prepayment was made on november   representing the remaining amount to be prepaid from the net proceeds from the tirzah sale 
while we do not expect to utilize our working capital facility to fund our ongoing operational needs for the foreseeable future  we have performed an evaluation of the financial institutions supporting our revolving credit agreement in order to assess their ability to provide capital under the working capital facility  if necessary 
our revolving credit agreement is supported by a diverse group of thirteen financial institutions 
management believes that we maintain strong relationships with the financial institutions within our current bank group and  to the extent necessary  will have sufficient access to the unused portion of the working capital facility million as of september  after considering outstanding letters of credit 
our revolving credit agreement matures in march and we will begin the process of renewing the agreement during the second quarter of fiscal partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 

table of contents on october   we announced a quarterly distribution of per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal payable on november  to holders of record on november  this quarterly distribution included an increase of per common unit  or per common unit on an annualized basis  from the previous quarterly distribution rate representing the nineteenth increase since our recapitalization in and a increase in the quarterly distribution rate since the fourth quarter of the prior year 
pension plan assets and obligations our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or however  we made voluntary contributions of million and million to the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  thereby taking proactive steps to improve the funded status of the plan 
as of september  and september   the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plan by million and million  respectively  which was recognized on the balance sheet as an asset 
although the projected benefit obligation under the defined benefit pension plan remained fully funded as of september   the funded status declined million compared to the prior year due to negative returns on plan assets during fiscal  which were attributable to the negative performance of the markets where the plan s assets are invested domestic fixed income securities market  as well as the domestic and international equity markets  offset to a considerable degree by a reduction in the present value of the benefit obligation due to a general increase in market interest rates 
our investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
during fiscal  the benefits committee proposed and the board of supervisors approved contributions to the plan in order to fully fund the projected benefit obligation and changed the plan s asset allocation to reduce investment risk and more closely match the expected returns on plan assets to the future cash requirements of the plan 
the implementation of this strategy resulted in a million voluntary contribution in fiscal from cash on hand and changed the asset allocation to reflect a greater concentration of fixed income securities 
at the end of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas  which requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income loss in the year the changes occur 
this adoption resulted in a million reduction to the prepaid pension asset and a million decrease to accrued postretirement liability  with the resulting million reduction in our net assets recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during fiscal  lump sum benefit payments of million exceeded the combined service and interest costs of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  pursuant to sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
during fiscal  the amount of the pension benefit obligation settled through lump sum payments was million  which did not exceed the settlement threshold of million  therefore  a settlement charge was not required to be recognized for fiscal additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments made in future periods 

table of contents there can be no assurance that future declines in capital markets  or interest rates  will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flow 
however  with the fully funded status of the plan  coupled with the shift in investment strategy to a higher concentration of fixed income securities  we expect over the long term that the returns on plan assets should largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation thus maintaining a fully funded status 
for purposes of measuring our projected benefit obligations  we increased the discount rate from as of september  to as of september   reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations 
for purposes of computing net periodic pension cost for fiscal  and  our assumed long term rate of return on plan assets was  and  respectively  based on the investment mix of our pension asset portfolio  historical asset performance and expectations for future performance 
the reduced expected return assumption for fiscal relative to prior years reflects the shift in asset mix away from equities and into fixed income investments  which was implemented in early fiscal we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
partnership employees hired prior to july are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement health care benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
effective january   we changed its postretirement health care plan from a self insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants

in addition  the payments do not reflect amounts to be recovered from our insurance providers  which was million as of september  and included in other current assets million and other assets million on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through october  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including approximately of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees certain of our operating leases  primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal  contain residual value guarantee provisions 
under those provisions  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period  or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of september  and september  
table of contents recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year  which began on september  in february of  the fasb provided an elective one year deferral of the provisions of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are only measured at fair value on a non recurring basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable as was the case in the propane and fuel oil markets during the first half of fiscal  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  availability of supply  and demand for a given time of the year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs depending on the time of the year 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts 
such contracts are exempted from the fair value accounting requirements of sfas and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and option contracts  forward contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter options collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with priced  physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on futures contracts will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices 
as a result of various market factors during the first half of fiscal  particularly commodity price volatility during the first four months of the fiscal year  we experienced additional margin opportunities due to favorable pricing under certain supply arrangements and from our hedging and risk management activities 
these market conditions generated additional operating profit of approximately million from incremental margin opportunities in fiscal  which were not present in fiscal 
table of contents with the dramatic rise in commodity prices in fiscal  particularly during the third quarter  we reported realized losses from our risk management activities that were not fully offset by sales of physical product  resulting in a negative effect on earnings of approximately million during fiscal as a result of continued market volatility  we made a decision under our risk management strategy to unwind all of our short futures positions during the third quarter of fiscal market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane or fuel oil market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk futures and fuel oil options are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with over the counter  forward and propane option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non performance by our counterparties 
interest rate risk a portion of our long term borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor plus an applicable margin depending on the level of our total leverage 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into an interest rate swap agreement 
on march   we entered into a million interest rate swap contract in conjunction with the term loan facility under the revolving credit agreement 
on september   we amended the interest rate swap contract to reduce the notional amount by million  representing the amount of the term loan prepaid on that date 
the interest rate swap is being accounted for under sfas and has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million representing an unrealized loss and is included within other liabilities with a corresponding debit in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
derivative instruments and hedging activities pursuant to sfas  all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold  or interest expense depending on the item being hedged  during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges used to hedge future purchases are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption under sfas  are recorded within cost of products sold as they occur 

table of contents at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets unrealized gains of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and derivative liabilities unrealized losses of million included within other current liabilities 
cost of products sold included unrealized non cash gains in the amount of million for the year ended september  compared to unrealized non cash losses of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane or fuel oil related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed contract price of open positions as of september  for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices for futures and forward contracts as of september  as derived from the nymex for traded propane or fuel oil futures for each of the future periods 
c 
the market prices determined in b 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future or option contract exists indicates either future losses or a reduction in potential future gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
the average posted price of propane on september  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september  the average posted price of fuel oil on september  at linden  new jersey was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september
