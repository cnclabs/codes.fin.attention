table of contents regulation our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision 
general our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 
state insurance laws and regulations insurance laws regulate most aspects of our us insurance businesses  and our us insurers are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our non us insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled 
our insurance products  and thus our businesses  also are affected by us federal  state and local tax laws  and the tax laws of non us jurisdictions 
insurance products that constitute securities  such as variable annuities and variable life insurance  also are subject to us federal and state and us securities laws and regulations 
the securities and exchange commission sec  the financial industry regulatory authority finra  formerly the nasd  inc  state securities authorities and non us authorities regulate and supervise these products 
our securities operations are subject to us federal and state and non us securities and related laws 
the sec  state securities authorities  finra and similar non us authorities are the principal regulators of these operations 
the primary purpose of the insurance laws affecting our insurance and securities businesses is to protect our customers and not our stockholders 
these insurance laws are regularly re examined and may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  insurance and securities regulatory authorities including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general or their non us equivalents increasingly make inquiries regarding compliance with insurance  securities and other laws and regulations  and we cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted 
many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations may affect our business relationships with them and their decision to purchase or distribute our subsidiaries products 
us insurance regulation our us insurers are licensed and regulated in all jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business 
the extent of this regulation varies  but insurance laws generally govern the financial condition of insurers  including standards of solvency  types and concentrations of permissible investments  establishment and maintenance of reserves  credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy  and the business conduct of insurers  including marketing and sales practices and claims handling 
in addition  insurance laws usually require the licensing of insurers and agents  and the approval of policy forms  related materials and the rates for certain lines of insurance 
the insurance laws applicable to us or our us insurers are described below 
our us mortgage insurers are also subject to additional insurance laws and regulations applicable specifically to mortgage insurers discussed below under mortgage insurance 
insurance holding company regulation all us jurisdictions in which our us insurers conduct business have enacted legislation requiring each us insurer except captive insurers in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory 
table of contents authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction and furnish that regulatory authority with various information concerning the operations of  and the interrelationships and transactions among  companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these insurance laws regulate transactions between insurers and their affiliates  sometimes mandating prior regulatory approval 
generally  these insurance laws require that all transactions between an insurer and an affiliate be fair and reasonable  and that the insurer s statutory surplus following such transaction be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of our own  we depend on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations  including the payment of interest on  and repayment of principal of  any debt obligations 
our us insurers payment of dividends or other distributions is regulated by the insurance laws of their respective domiciliary states  and insurers may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution  or pay a dividend except out of earned surplus  without prior regulatory approval 
in general  an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution that  together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater or  in some jurisdictions  the lesser of of the insurer s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end  or the statutory net gain from the insurer s operations if a life insurer or the statutory net income if not a life insurer during the prior calendar year 
in addition  insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurers such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders 
the insurance laws of our us insurers domiciliary jurisdictions require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction prior to acquiring control of such insurer 
control of an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the insurer or its ultimate parent entity 
in considering an application to acquire control of an insurer  the insurance commissioner generally considers factors such as the experience  competence and financial strength of the applicant  the integrity of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquirer s plans for the management and operation of the insurer  and any anti competitive results that may arise from the acquisition 
some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates and the target insurer and its affiliates have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in those states 
these provisions may not require acquisition approval but can lead to imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control involving us  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
periodic reporting our us insurers must file reports  including detailed annual financial statements  with insurance regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which they do business  and their operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities 
policy forms our us insurers policy forms are subject to regulation in every us jurisdiction in which they transact insurance business 
in most us jurisdictions  policy forms must be filed prior to their use  and in some us jurisdictions  forms must be approved prior to use 

table of contents market conduct regulation the insurance laws of us jurisdictions govern the marketplace activities of insurers  affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers  product illustrations  advertising  product replacement  sales and underwriting practices  and complaint and claims handling  and these provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations 
statutory examinations insurance departments in us jurisdictions conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books  records  accounts and business practices of domestic insurers 
these examinations generally are conducted in cooperation with the insurance departments of two or three other states or jurisdictions  representing each of the naic zones  under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
in the three year period ended december   we have not received any material adverse findings resulting from any insurance department examinations of our us insurance subsidiaries 
guaranty associations and similar arrangements most jurisdictions in which our us insurers are licensed require those insurers to participate in guaranty associations  which pay contractual benefits owed under the policies of impaired or insolvent insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
aggregate assessments levied against our us insurers were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
policy and contract reserve sufficiency analysis the insurance laws of their domiciliary jurisdictions require our us life insurers to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and health insurance and annuity reserves 
other jurisdictions where insurers are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions 
in each case  a qualified actuary must submit an opinion stating that the aggregate statutory reserves  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves  make good and sufficient provision for the insurer s associated contractual obligations and related expenses 
if such an opinion cannot be provided  the insurer must establish additional reserves by transferring funds from surplus 
our us life insurers submit these opinions annually to applicable insurance regulatory authorities 
different reserve requirements exist for our us mortgage insurance subsidiaries 
see reserves mortgage insurance 
surplus and capital requirements insurance regulators have the discretionary authority  in connection with the ongoing licensing of our us insurers  to limit or restrict insurers from issuing new policies  or policies having a dollar value over certain thresholds  if  in the regulators judgment  the insurer is not maintaining a sufficient amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition 
we do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our us insurers present a material risk that any regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our us insurers may issue 
risk based capital the naic has established risk based capital standards for us life insurers  as well as a model act  intended to be adopted by the states 
the model act requires life insurers submit annually a report to state regulators 
table of contents regarding their risk based capital based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors which vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula is an early warning tool to identify possibly weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
if an insurer s risk based capital falls below specified levels  it would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level  ranging from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control 
as of december   the risk based capital of each of our us life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of risk based capital that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action 
statutory accounting principles us insurance regulators developed statutory accounting principles sap as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurers 
since insurance regulators are primarily concerned with assuring an insurer s ability to pay its current and future obligations to policyholders  statutory accounting conservatively values the assets and liabilities of insurers  generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction 
uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the naic and generally adopted by regulators in the various us jurisdictions 
due to differences in methodology between sap and us gaap  the values for assets  liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under sap 
regulation of investments each of our us insurers is subject to insurance laws that require diversification of its investment portfolio and limit the proportion of investments in certain asset categories  such as non investment grade fixed maturity securities  equity real estate  other equity investments and derivatives 
assets invested contrary to such regulatory limitations must be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  would require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments made by our us insurers comply with these insurance laws 
federal regulation most of our variable annuity  and all of our variable life insurance products  as well as our fabns issued as part of our registered notes program are securities within the meaning of federal and state securities laws  are registered under the securities act of and subject to regulation by the sec 
these products may also be regulated by finra and state securities authorities 
federal and state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under securities regulation affect investment advice and sales and related activities with respect to these products 
in addition  although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including taxation  financial services regulation and pension and welfare benefits regulation  can also significantly affect the insurance industry 
federal initiatives although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often  and increasingly  have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
from time to time  federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business  including limitations on antitrust immunity  tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts  simplification bills affecting tax advantaged or tax exempt savings and retirement vehicles  and proposals to modify or make permanent the estate tax repeal enacted in 
table of contents in addition  various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed in recent years 
we cannot predict whether any such proposals will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or  if adopted  such laws may have on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
changes in tax laws changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers 
for example  the gradual repeal of the federal estate tax  begun in  which is continuing to be phased in through  has resulted in reduced sales  and could continue to adversely affect sales and surrenders  of some of our estate planning products  including survivorship second to die life insurance policies 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which lowered the federal income tax rate on capital gains and certain ordinary dividends  may provide an incentive for certain of our customers and potential customers to shift assets into mutual funds and away from our products  including annuities designed to defer taxes payable on investment returns 
on the other hand  individual income tax rates are scheduled to revert to previous levels in tax years beginning after  possibly positively influencing investors to buy our products  and the expiration of favorable income tax rates for dividend income could increase interest in our products 
uk insurance regulation general insurance and reinsurance businesses in the uk are subject to close regulation by the financial services authority fsa  which has authorized certain of our uk subsidiaries to effect and carry out contracts of insurance in the uk insurers authorized in the uk are generally able to operate throughout the european union  subject to satisfying certain fsa requirements and  in some cases  additional local regulatory provisions 
certain of our uk subsidiaries operate in other european union member states through establishment of branch offices 
supervision the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurers whereby it periodically performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile  including details of remedial action the fsa requires and the likely consequences of not taking such actions 
the fsa also supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  which subjects any person appointed to perform certain specified controlled functions for a regulated entity to fsa approval 
in addition  in january  the fsa began to supervise the sale of general insurance  including payment protection insurance and mortgage insurance 
under fsa rules  persons involved in the sale of general insurance including insurers and distributors are prohibited from offering or accepting any inducement in connection with the sale of general insurance that is likely to conflict materially with their duties to insureds 
although the rules do not generally require disclosure of broker compensation  the insurer or distributor must disclose broker compensation at the insured s request 
solvency requirements under fsa rules  insurers must maintain a minimum amount of capital resources for solvency purposes at all times  the calculation of which depends on the type  amount and claims history of the insurer 
failure to maintain the required minimum amount of capital resources is one of the grounds on which the fsa may exercise its wide powers of intervention 
in addition  an insurer that is part of a group is required to perform and submit to the fsa a capital resources calculation return in respect of the following the solvency capital resources available to the uk insurer s european group  which is defined by reference to the uk insurer s ultimate parent company domiciled in the european economic area 

table of contents prior to december   this requirement was only a reporting requirement  but now the fsa is required to take action where the european group s solvency capital requirements exceed that group s available capital resources 
the solvency capital resources available to the uk insurer s worldwide group  which is defined by reference to the uk insurer s ultimate parent company 
this requirement is only a reporting requirement 
restrictions on dividend payments english company law prohibits uk insurers from declaring a dividend to their stockholders unless they have profits available for distribution  the determination of which is based on the insurer s audited accumulated realized profits  less its accumulated realized losses 
change of control the acquisition of control of any uk insurer requires prior fsa approval 
for these purposes  a party that controls a uk insurer includes any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in such insurer or its parent company  or amongst others is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power of such insurer or its parent company or is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or voting power 
the requirement for prior fsa approval also exists where an existing approved controller increases its control through certain thresholds  and 
to approve an application for approval  the fsa must be satisfied that both the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against our uk subsidiaries by the fsa 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an insurer or authorized person and has the power  among other things  to enforce  and take disciplinary measures in respect of  breaches of its rules  which includes the variation or withdraw of any authorizations 
mortgage insurance state regulation general mortgage insurers generally are limited by insurance laws to writing mortgage insurance business exclusively  prohibiting our mortgage insurers from directly writing other types of insurance 
mortgage insurers are not subject to the naic s risk based capital requirements but are subject to other capital requirements placed directly on mortgage insurers 
generally  mortgage insurers are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain a risk in force to capital ratio not to exceed as of december   none of our us mortgage insurance subsidiaries had a risk in force to capital ratio in excess of reserves insurance laws require our us mortgage insurer to establish a special statutory contingency reserve in their statutory financial statements to provide for losses in the event of significant economic declines 
annual additions to the statutory contingency reserve must equal the greater of i of net earned premiums or ii the required level of policyholder s position  as defined by insurance laws 
these contingency reserves generally are 
table of contents held until the earlier of i the time that loss ratios exceed or ii ten years  although regulators have granted discretionary releases from time to time 
the statutory contingency reserve for our us mortgage insurers was approximately billion as of december  this reserve reduces the policyholder surplus of our us mortgage insurers  and therefore  their ability to pay dividends to us 
federal regulation in addition to federal laws that directly affect mortgage insurers  private mortgage insurers are affected indirectly by federal legislation and regulation affecting mortgage originators and lenders  by purchasers of mortgage loans such as freddie mac and fannie mae  and by governmental insurers such as the fha and va 
for example  changes in federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance may have a material effect on private mortgage insurers 
legislation or regulation that increases the number of people eligible for fha or va mortgages could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to compete with the fha or va 
the homeowners protection act provides for the automatic termination  or cancellation upon a borrower s request  of private mortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
the homeowners protection act applies to owner occupied residential mortgage loans regardless of lien priority and to borrower paid mortgage insurance closed after july  fha loans are not covered by the homeowners protection act 
under the homeowners protection act  automatic termination of mortgage insurance would generally occur once the loan to value ratio reaches 
a borrower generally may request cancellation of mortgage insurance once the actual payments reduce the loan balance to of the home s original value 
for borrower initiated cancellation of mortgage insurance  the borrower must have a good payment history as defined by the homeowners protection act 
the real estate settlement and procedures act of respa applies to most residential mortgages insured by private mortgage insurers 
mortgage insurance has been considered in some cases to be a settlement service for purposes of loans subject to respa 
subject to limited exceptions  respa precludes us from providing services to mortgage lenders free of charge  charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value  and paying fees for services that others provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value 
in addition  respa prohibits persons from giving or accepting any portion or percentage of a charge for a real estate settlement service  other than for services actually performed 
although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving rebates  respa has been interpreted to cover many non fee services as well 
mortgage insurers and their customers are subject to the possible sanctions of this law  which may be enforced by the us department of housing and urban development administration hud  state insurance departments  state attorneys general and other enforcement authorities 
the equal credit opportunity act ecoa and the fair credit reporting act fcra also affect the business of mortgage insurance in various ways 
ecoa  for example  prohibits discrimination against certain protected classes in credit transactions 
fcra governs the access and use of consumer credit information in credit transactions and requires notices to consumers in certain circumstances 
most originators of mortgage loans are required to collect and report data relating to a mortgage loan applicant s race  nationality  gender  marital status and census tract to hud or the federal reserve under the home mortgage disclosure act of hmda 
the purpose of hmda is to detect possible impermissible discrimination in home lending and  through disclosure  to discourage such discrimination 
mortgage insurers are not required to report hmda data although  under the laws of several states  mortgage insurers currently are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of certain classifications 
mortgage insurers have  through mortgage insurance companies of america mica  entered voluntarily into an agreement with the federal financial institutions examinations council to report the same data on loans submitted for insurance as is required for most mortgage lenders under hmda 

table of contents international regulation canada the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi provides oversight to all federally incorporated financial institutions  including our canadian mortgage insurance company 
osfi does not have enforcement powers over market conduct issues in the insurance industry  which are a provincial responsibility 
the federal bank act  insurance companies act and trust and loan companies act prohibits canadian banks  trust companies and insurers from extending mortgage loans where the loan value exceeds of the property s value  unless mortgage insurance is obtained in connection with the loan 
as a result  all mortgages issued by these financial institutions with a loan to value ratio exceeding must be insured by a qualified insurer or the cmhc 
as a result of a periodic review of the federal financial services regulatory framework the canadian parliament in april passed legislation that increased from to the loan to value threshold above which mortgage insurance is required by federal statute 
this may result in a reduction in the amount of business we write in future years in canada 
we have an agreement with the canadian government under which it guarantees the benefits payable under a mortgage insurance policy  less of the original principal amount of an insured loan  in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency 
we pay the canadian government a risk premium for this guarantee and make other payments to a reserve fund in respect of the government s obligation 
because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee  our sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 
the legislative requirement in canada to obtain mortgage insurance on high loan to value mortgages and the favorable capital treatment given to financial institutions because of our sovereign guarantee effectively precludes these financial institutions from issuing simultaneous second mortgage products similar to those offered in the us australia apra regulates all financial institutions in australia  including general  life and mortgage insurance companies 
effective july   apra provided new regulatory standards for all general insurers  including mortgage insurers 
apra s license conditions currently require australian mortgage insurers to be monoline insurers  which are insurers offering just one type of insurance product 
apra also sets authorized capital levels and regulates corporate governance requirements  including our risk management strategy 
in this regard  apra reviews our management  controls  processes  reporting and methods by which all risks are managed  including a periodic review of outstanding insurance liabilities by an approved actuary  and a reinsurance management strategy  which outlines our use of reinsurance in australia 
in addition  apra determines the capital requirements for depository institutions and provides for reduced capital requirements for certain depository institutions that insure residential mortgages with an acceptable mortgage insurer for all non standard mortgages and for standard mortgages with loan to value ratios above 
apra s regulations currently set out a number of circumstances in which a loan may be considered to be non standard from a depository institution s perspective 
effective january   apra adopted new regulations regarding minimum capital requirements for mortgage insurance companies  reporting obligations of mortgage insurance companies  and 
table of contents conditions under which depository institutions will be entitled to reduced capital requirements for insured loans 
apra rules also provide that lmi on a non performing loan days plus arrears protects most depository institutions from having to increase the regulatory capital on the loan to a risk weighting of 
the new regulations impose significantly higher minimum capital requirements on mortgage insurers to assure they have sufficient capital to withstand a hypothetical three year stress loss scenario 
in addition  the new regulations increase mortgage insurers capital requirements for insured loans that are considered to be non standard 
our australian mortgage insurance subsidiary met these new minimum capital requirements as of january  the new regulations also impose additional quarterly reporting obligations on mortgage insurers with respect to risk profiles and reinsurance arrangements  amend the definition of an acceptable mortgage insurer and eliminate the reduced capital requirements for depository institutions in the event that the mortgage insurer has contractual recourse to the depository institution or a member of its consolidated group

the registered representatives of our broker dealers are also regulated by the sec and finra and are further subject to applicable state and local laws 

table of contents these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 
in such event  the possible sanctions that may be imposed include suspension of individual employees  limitations on the activities in which the investment adviser or broker dealer may engage  suspension or revocation of the investment adviser or broker dealer registration  censure or fines

hud conducts periodic  detailed examinations of the loans and business practices of reverse mortgage loans it insures 
environmental considerations as an owner and operator of real property  we are subject to extensive us federal and state and us environmental laws and regulations 
potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties also is an inherent risk in property ownership and operation 
in addition  we hold equity interests in companies and have made loans secured by properties that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities 
we routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure 
we cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise 
however  based upon information currently available to us  we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
erisa considerations we provide certain products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to erisa or the internal revenue code 
as such  our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal 
table of contents revenue code  including the requirement under erisa that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries and fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such plans

usa patriot act the usa patriot act of the patriot act  enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on september   contains anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker dealers and other financial services companies including insurance companies 
the patriot act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
anti money laundering laws outside of the us contain similar provisions 
the increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers  watch for and report suspicious transactions  respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  and share information with other financial institutions  require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures and controls 
we believe that we have implemented  and that we maintain  appropriate internal practices  procedures and controls to enable us to comply with the provisions of the patriot act 
certain additional requirements became applicable under the patriot act in may through a us treasury regulation  which required that certain insurers have anti money laundering compliance plans in place 
we will comply with these new provisions as they become applicable to us 
privacy of consumer information us federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions  including insurance companies  to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
similarly  federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information 
in particular  regulations promulgated by the us department of health and human services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others  the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic transmission of such information 
congress and state legislatures are expected to consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information 
in europe  the collection and use of personal information is subject to strict regulation 
the european union s data protection directive establishes a series of privacy requirements that european union member states are obliged to enact in their national legislation 
european countries that are not european union member states have similar privacy requirements in their national laws 
these requirements generally apply to all businesses  including insurance companies 
in general  companies may process personal information only if consent has been obtained from the persons concerned or if certain other conditions are met 
these other requirements include the provision of notice to customers and other persons concerning how their personal information is used and disclosed  limitations on the transfer of personal information to countries outside the european union  registration with the national privacy authorities  where applicable  and the use of appropriate information security measures against the access or use of personal information by unauthorized persons 
similar laws and regulations protecting the security and confidentiality of consumer and financial information are also in effect in canada  australia and other countries in which we operate

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
these risks are not exclusive  and additional risks to which we are subject include  but are not limited to  the factors mentioned under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  risks relating to our businesses interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and profitability 
our insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that falling interest rates will reduce our spread  or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we must pay policyholders and contractholders 
because we may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited  pre established intervals  and because some contracts have guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates  declines in interest rates may adversely affect the profitability of these products 
during periods of increasing market interest rates  we may offer higher crediting rates on interest sensitive products  such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities  and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive 
in addition  rapidly rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders  withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans  as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments 
increases in crediting rates  as well as surrenders and withdrawals  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our term life and long term care insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns 
over time  term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums  which we invest as we receive them 
low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products 
in both the us and international mortgage markets  rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations 
a decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our new mortgage insurance written 
rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages arm which could have the effect of increasing default rates on arm loans and thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies 
this is particularly relevant in our international mortgage insurance business  where arms are the predominant mortgage product 
arms also have increased as a percentage of the us mortgage loans that we insure 
declining interest rates increase the rate at which insured borrowers refinance their existing mortgages  thereby resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans 
declining interest rates may also contribute to home price appreciation  which may provide insured borrowers in the us with the option of canceling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated in pricing that coverage 
these cancellations could have an adverse effect on our results from our mortgage insurance business 
interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolios 
during periods of declining market interest rates  the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases 
in addition  during those periods  we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of 
table of contents principal on our investments in lower yielding high grade instruments or in lower credit instruments to maintain comparable returns 
issuers of fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbates the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower yielding or lower credit instruments 
additionally  recent volatility and uncertainty in the sub prime residential market has resulted in increased interest rates and delinquency rates 
these developments have had an adverse impact on our us mortgage insurance business  as well as our investments in securities backed by sub prime residential mortgage loans 
see a deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home price appreciation may adversely affect our loss experience in mortgage insurance 
downturns and volatility in equity and credit markets could adversely affect our business and profitability 
significant downturns and volatility in equity and credit markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in several ways 
equity markets downturns and volatility in equity markets may discourage purchases of separate account products  such as variable annuities and variable life insurance  that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products 
our revenues and returns from our mutual fund wrapped and separately managed account products and services could also be impacted by downturns and volatility in equity markets 
because these products and services generate fees generally from the value of assets under management  a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage 
downturns in equity markets could also lead to an increase in liabilities associated with secondary guarantee features  such as guaranteed minimum benefits on separate account products  where we have equity market risk exposure 
credit markets issuers of the fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans that we own may default on principal and interest payments if there are downturns and volatility in credit markets 
as of december  and  we had fixed maturity securities in or near default where the issuer has missed payment of principal or interest or entered bankruptcy with a fair value of million and million  respectively 
an economic downturn  or a variety of other factors  could cause declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and cause our net income to decline 
during  credit markets experienced reduced liquidity  higher volatility and widening credit spreads across asset classes mainly as a result of marketplace uncertainty arising from higher defaults in sub prime and alt a residential mortgage loans 
in connection with this uncertainty  we believe investors and lenders have retreated from many investments in asset backed securities including those associated with sub prime and alt a residential mortgage loans  as well as types of debt investments with weak lender protections or those with limited transparency and or complex features which hindered investor understanding 
at the same time  investors shifted emphasis towards safety pushing up the demand for us treasury instruments 
the current credit market conditions resulted in an unfavorable liquidity environment for issuers of financial instruments including commercial paper  long term debt and asset backed securities 
in addition  this downturn has an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently access capital markets for capital management purposes  including the issuance of fixed and floating rate non recourse funding obligations for purposes of supporting our term and universal life insurance products 
investors in certain of our institutional products  such as fabns and funding agreements  may be encouraged not to exercise their option to extend maturity dates in favor of investment alternatives offering 
table of contents higher returns or different liquidity features if there are downturns and volatility in credit markets 
because we earn a spread between interest earned and interest credited on these institutional products under management  the failure of investors in these products to extend the maturity dates could reduce our revenues and profitability by reducing institutional product liabilities we manage 
in addition  the earlier than anticipated maturity of these institutional funds on deposit may cause us to liquidate underlying investments earlier than anticipated  which could result in investment losses  depending on market conditions at the time 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
financial strength ratings  which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our products  the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
our principal life insurance companies currently have financial strength ratings of aa very strong from s p and fitch  a superior from am best and aa excellent from moody s 
our mortgage insurance companies currently have financial strength ratings of aa very strong from s p and fitch  aa excellent from moody s and or aa superior from dbrs 
the a rating is the second highest of am best s ratings 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of s p s ratings categories  respectively 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of moody s ratings categories  respectively 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of fitch s ratings categories 
the aa rating is the second highest of dbrs s ten ratings categories 
in early  moody s and s p  as part of a broad reassessment of the us mortgage insurance industry  affirmed the ratings of our principal mortgage insurance subsidiaries and  at the same time  changed the rating outlook from stable to negative 
a downgrade in any of our financial strength ratings  or the announced potential for a downgrade  could have a significantly adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders  requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive  requiring us to post additional collateral or terminate contracts under the terms of the international swaps and derivatives association agreements with derivative counterparties  adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance  and increasing our cost of borrowing 
if our mortgage insurance companies financial strength ratings decrease below the thresholds established by fannie mae and freddie mac  we would not be able to insure mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac 
fannie mae and freddie mac currently require maintenance of a rating by at least two out of three listed rating agencies s p  fitch and moody s of at least aa aa as applicable  with no rating below those levels by any of the three listed rating agencies  otherwise additional limitations or requirements may be imposed for eligibility to insure loans purchased by the gses 
in february  fannie mae and freddie mac temporarily suspended automatic imposition of the additional requirements otherwise applicable upon a ratings downgrade below the above described requirements  subject to certain specified conditions 
as of december   fannie mae and freddie mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured in the us an inability to insure mortgage loans sold to fannie mae or freddie mac  or their transfer of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer  would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  the current maximum rate on our non recourse funding obligations may be reset to higher rates based on rating agency downgrades of the third party financial guaranty insurance companies that guaranteed these obligations 
if our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate  we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with us gaap and industry accounting practices 
we release these reserves as those future obligations are extinguished 
the reserves we establish necessarily reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience 
these estimates and actuarial assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment 
our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves 
many factors can affect future experience  including economic and social conditions  inflation  healthcare costs  policyholder persistency resulting in adverse claims experience  and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments 
we regularly monitor our reserves 
if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments  we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we recently increased our loss reserves for our us mortgage insurance business as a result of an increase in delinquencies  along with an increase in the average loan balance of mortgage loan delinquencies 
see risks relating to our us mortgage insurance segment below 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations 
we act as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our current and any future borrowings 
these obligations also include amounts we owe to ge under the tax matters agreement that we and ge entered into in connection with our ipo 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations  we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt  the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  are also subject to various guidelines established by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 
our businesses are subject to intense competition 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features  price  commission structure  marketing and distribution arrangements  brand  reputation  financial strength ratings and service 

table of contents many other companies actively compete for sales in our retirement and protection markets  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and asset management firms and specialty and capital markets providers 
in addition  alternative products that leverage the capital markets could compete with traditional insurance products and reduce our market share 
the principal direct and indirect competitors for our us and increasingly  international mortgage insurance businesses include other private mortgage insurers  structured transactions in the capital markets  other financial instruments designed to manage credit risk  such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes  lenders who forego mortgage insurance  or self insure  on loans held in their portfolios  and lenders that provide mortgage reinsurance through captive mortgage reinsurance programs 
further  we also compete with governmental and quasi governmental agencies  including in the us  the fha and to a lesser degree  the va  fannie mae and freddie mac 
in canada and some european countries  our mortgage insurance business competes directly with government entities  which provide comparable mortgage insurance 
government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our business lines 
in addition  in recent years  banks  insurance companies and other financial services companies  many of which offer products similar to ours and use similar distribution channels  have consolidated 
further consolidation among banks  insurance companies and other financial services companies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if the surviving entity requires more favorable terms than we had previously been offering to one or more of the combined companies or if it elects not to continue to do business with us following the consolidation 
reinsurance may not be available  affordable or adequate to protect us against losses 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business 
if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform  we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we use reinsurance and derivative instruments to mitigate our risks in various circumstances 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we ceded to uflic substantially all of our in force structured settlements block of business  variable annuity business and the long term care insurance assumed from metlife insurance company of connecticut  formerly known as the travelers insurance company  as of december  uflic has established trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements  and general electric capital corporation ge capital  an indirect subsidiary of ge  has agreed to maintain uflic s risk based capital above a specified minimum level 
if uflic becomes insolvent 
table of contents notwithstanding this agreement  and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay uflic s obligations to us  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected
