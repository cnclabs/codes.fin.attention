item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we view our business as comprised of the following five business segments domestic xtrac  international dermatology equipment  skin care procyte  surgical services  and surgical products 
domestic xtrac our domestic xtrac segment is a us business with revenues primarily derived from procedures performed by dermatologists 
we are engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of our proprietary xtrac excimer laser and delivery systems and techniques used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders  including psoriasis  vitiligo  atopic dermatitis and leukoderma 
as part of our commercialization strategy in the united states  we offer the xtrac laser system to targeted dermatologists at no initial capital cost 
under this contractual arrangement  we maintain ownership of the laser and earn revenue each time a physician treats a patient with the equipment  and we believe this arrangement will increase market penetration 
at times  however  we sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference 
we are finding that through sales of lasers we are able to reach  at respectable margins  a sector of the market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
for the past six years  we have sought to clear the path of obstacles and barriers to a roll out of the xtrac laser system in dermatology 
our efforts culminated in march  when the blue cross blue shield association bcbsa published a national reference policy that now recommends positive reimbursement coverage for psoriasis  including the xtrac  as first step therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis comprising less than body area 
subsequent to publication of this reference policy many states adopted the xtrac as a reimbursable procedure including the blue cross blue shield insurance plans in illinois  new mexico  oklahoma  texas and california 
only a few remaining states do not have a positive payment policy 
we estimate that of the insured population in the united states has plan coverage for the treatment of psoriasis by the excimer laser 
our person xtrac sales organization includes sales representatives  clinical specialists and marketing support personnel 
our person skin care sales organization includes sales representatives  customer service representatives and marketing support personnel 
the sales representatives of each segment provide follow up sales support and share sales leads to enhance opportunities for cross selling 
our marketing department has been instrumental in expanding the advertising campaign for the xtrac laser system 
while our sales and marketing expenses have grown faster than the revenues on which the expenses are targeted to have positive impact  we expect to increase our overall revenue and productivity as a result of these expenditures in the long term 
for example  we have tried various direct to consumer marketing programs that have positively influenced utilization  but the payback in utilization is expected to be attained in periods subsequent to the period in which we incurred the expense 
we have also increased the number of sales representatives and established a group of clinical support specialists to optimize utilization levels and better secure the willingness and interest of patients to seek follow up courses of treatment after the effect of the first battery of treatment sessions starts to wear off 

table of contents international dermatology equipment in the international market  we derive revenues by selling our dermatology laser systems to distributors and directly to physicians 
in this market  we have benefited from both our clinical studies and from the improved reliability and functionality of the xtrac laser system 
compared to the domestic segment  the sales of laser systems in the international segment is influenced to a greater degree by competition from similar laser technologies as well as non laser lamp alternatives 
over time  this competition has reduced the prices we are able to charge to international distributors for our xtrac products 
in  as a result of the acquisition of worldwide rights to certain proprietary light based technology from stern  we also explored new product offerings in the treatment of dermatological conditions 
we expanded the international marketing of this product  called the vtrac  in the vtrac is a lamp based uvb targeted therapy  positioned at a price point lower than the xtrac laser system so that it will effectively compete with other non laser based therapies for psoriasis and vitiligo 
skin care procyte on march   we completed the acquisition of procyte corporation 
procyte generates revenues from the sale of skin health  hair care and wound care products  the sale of copper peptide compound in bulk  and royalties on licenses for the patented copper peptide compound 
the operating results of procyte for the year ended december  are included from march  through december  under purchase accounting rules  the operating results of procyte for prior periods are not included in our statement of operations 
a description of transaction and pro forma operating results are disclosed as part of note  acquisitions  to the financial statements 
procyte s focus has been to provide unique products  primarily based upon patented technologies for selected applications in the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery and spa markets 
procyte has also expanded the use of its novel copper peptide technologies into the mass retail market for skin and hair care through targeted technology licensing and supply agreements 
procyte s products are aimed at the growing demand for skin health and hair care products  including products to enhance appearance and address the effects of aging on skin and hair 
procyte s products are formulated  branded and targeted at specific markets 
procyte s initial products addressed the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery markets for use after various procedures 
anti aging skin care products were added to offer a comprehensive approach for a patient s skincare regimen 
surgical services the surgical services segment typically generates revenues by providing fee based procedures using our mobile surgical laser equipment delivered and operated by a technician at hospitals and surgery centers in the united states 
we have pursued a cautious growth strategy for this business segment in order to conserve our cash resources for the xtrac business segments 
we have limited marketing experience in expanding our surgical services business 
the majority of this business is in the southeastern part of the united states 
new procedures and geographical expansion  together with new customers and different business habits and networks  will likely continue to pose different challenges compared to those that we have encountered in the past 
surgical products the surgical products segment generates revenues by selling laser products and disposables to hospitals and surgery centers both inside and outside of the united states 
also included are various non laser surgical products eg the clearess ii suction irrigation system 
surgical product revenues decreased in compared to  reflecting we believe that sales of surgical laser systems and the related disposable base have eroded as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
we are working to offset this erosion by increasing sales from the diode surgical laser introduced in  including oem arrangements 

table of contents in september  we entered into a three year oem agreement with angiodynamics under which we manufacture for angiodynamics  on a non exclusive basis  a private label  nanometer diode laser system 
the system is designed for use with angiodynamics nevertouch venacure patented endovenous therapy for treatment of varicose veins 
the oem agreement provides that we shall supply this laser on an exclusive basis to angiodynamics  should angiodynamics meet certain purchase requirements 
having received from angiodynamics a purchase order that exceeded the minimum purchase requirement for delivery of lasers over the first contract year  we will now provide this laser exclusively to angiodynamics for worldwide sale in the peripheral vascular treatment field 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  impairment of property and equipment and of intangibles and accruals for warranty claims 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with these policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition xtrac related operations we have two distribution channels for our phototherapy treatment equipment 
we either i place the laser in a physician s offices at no charge to the physician and charge the physician a fee for an agreed upon number of treatments or ii to a lesser extent  sell the laser through a distributor or directly to a physician 
when we sell an xtrac laser to a distributor or directly to a foreign or domestic physician  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria under staff accounting bulletin no 
have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable the sab criteria 
at times  units are shipped  but revenue is not recognized until all of the sab criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
we ship most of our products fob shipping point  although from time to time certain customers  for example governmental customers  will insist upon fob destination 
among the factors we take into account in determining the proper time at which to recognize revenue are when title to the goods transfers and when the risk of loss transfers 
shipments to distributors or physicians that do not fully satisfy the collection criteria are recognized when invoiced amounts are assured or fully paid 
under the terms of our distributor agreements  distributors do not have a unilateral right to return any unit that they have purchased 
however  we do allow products to be returned by our distributors for product defects or other claims 
when we place a laser in a physician s office  we recognize service revenue based on the number of patient treatments performed by the physician 
treatments in the form of random laser access codes that are sold to physicians  but not yet used  are deferred and recognized as a liability until the physician performs the treatment 
unused treatments remain an obligation of ours because the treatments can only be performed on our equipment 
once the treatments are delivered to a patient  this obligation has been satisfied 

table of contents we exclude all sales of treatment codes made within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers 
our management believes this approach closely approximates the actual amount of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the years ended december  and  we deferred  and  respectively  under this approach 
we have a program to support certain physicians in addressing treatments with the xtrac laser system that may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers 
we recognize service revenue from the sale of treatment codes to physicians participating in this program only if and to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
we estimate a contingent liability for potential refunds under this program by reviewing the history of denied insurance claims and appeals processed 
at december  and  we had net deferred revenues of  and  respectively  under this program 
skin care operations we generate revenues from our skin care business primarily through three channels 
the primarily channel is through product sales for skin health  hair care and wound care  the second is through sales of the copper peptide compound  primarily to neutrogena corporation  a johnson johnson company  and the third is through royalties generated by our licenses  principally to neutrogena 
the second and third channels have become minor 
we recognize revenues on the products and copper peptide compound when they are shipped  net of returns and allowances 
we ship the products fob shipping point 
royalty revenues are based upon sales generated by our licensees 
we recognize royalty revenue at the applicable royalty rate applied to shipments reported by our licensee 
surgical products and service operations we generate revenues from our surgical businesses primarily from two channels 
the first is through product sales of laser systems  related maintenance service agreements  recurring laser delivery systems and laser accessories  and the second is through per procedure surgical services 
we recognize revenues from surgical laser and other product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the sab criteria have been met 
for per procedure surgical services  we recognize revenue upon the completion of the procedure 
revenue from maintenance service agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
revenue from billable services  including repair activity  is recognized when the service is provided 
inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is determined to be purchased cost for raw materials and the production cost materials  labor and indirect manufacturing cost for work in process and finished goods 
throughout the laser manufacturing process  the related production costs are recorded within inventory 
work in process is immaterial  given the typically short manufacturing cycle  and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials 
we perform full physical inventory counts for xtrac and cycle counts on the other inventory to maintain controls and obtain accurate data 
our xtrac laser is either i sold to distributors or physicians directly or ii placed in a physician s office and remains our property 
the cost to build a laser  whether for sale or for placement  is accumulated in inventory 
when a laser is placed in a physician s office  the cost is transferred from inventory to lasers in service within property and equipment 
at times  units are shipped to distributors  but revenue is not recognized until all of the sab criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
revenue is not recognized from these distributors until payment is either assured or paid in full 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves periodically based on forecasted sales and market trends 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the majority of receivables related to phototherapy sales are due from various distributors located outside of the united states and from physicians located inside the united states 
the majority of receivables related to skincare products  surgical services and surgical products are due from various customers and distributors located inside the united states 
from time to time  our customers dispute the amounts due to us  and  in other cases  our customers experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectible accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectible accounts involves significant judgment 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectibility could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
property and equipment 
as of december  and  we had net property and equipment of  and  respectively 
the most significant component of these amounts relates to the xtrac lasers placed by us in physicians offices 
we own the equipment and charge the physician on a per treatment basis for use of the equipment 
the recoverability of the net carrying value of the lasers is predicated on continuing revenues from the physicians use of the lasers 
if the physician does not generate sufficient treatments  then we remove the laser from the physician s office and redeploy elsewhere 
in reflection of their improved reliability  xtrac lasers placed in service after december  are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years  other xtrac lasers in service continue to be depreciated over the original useful life of three years 
surgical lasers in service are depreciated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of seven years if new  five years or less if used equipment 
the straight line depreciation basis for lasers in service is reflective of the pattern of use 
for other property and equipment  including property and equipment acquired from procyte  depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  primarily three to seven years for computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or lease terms 
useful lives are determined based upon an estimate of either physical or economic obsolescence  or both 
intangibles 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on various factors  including market conditions and operational performance of our business 
as of december  and  we had  and   respectively  of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for and of our total assets at the respective dates 
the goodwill is not amortizable  the other intangibles are 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test our goodwill for impairment  at least annually 
this test is usually conducted in december of each year in connection with the annual budgeting and forecast process 
also  on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether events have occurred that would negatively impact the realizable value of our intangibles or goodwill 
there has been no change in and to the carrying value of goodwill that is allocated to the xtrac domestic segment and the xtrac international segment in the amounts of  and  respectively 
the allocation of goodwill to each segment was based upon the relative fair values of the two segments as of august  when we bought out the minority interest in acculase  inc and thus recognized the goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of procyte on march   we acquired certain intangibles recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and allocated fully to the skin care procyte segment 
in  we adjusted the carrying value of the goodwill from the procyte acquisition reflecting management s best estimate of pre acquisition contingencies based upon plans entered into prior to march  the balances of these acquired intangibles  net of amortization  were december  procyte neutrogena agreement procyte customer relationships procyte tradename procyte developed technologies goodwill total 
table of contents deferred income taxes 
we have a deferred tax asset that is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
we have not recognized the deferred tax asset  given our historical losses and the lack of certainty of future taxable income 
however  if and when we become profitable and can reasonably foresee continuing profitability  then under sfas no 
we may recognize some of the deferred tax asset 
the recognized portion may variously reduce acquired goodwill  increase stockholders equity directly and or benefit the statement of operations 
warranty accruals 
we establish a liability for warranty repairs based on estimated future claims for xtrac systems and based on historical analysis of the cost of the repairs for surgical laser systems 
however  future returns of defective laser systems and related warranty liability could differ significantly from estimates  and historical patterns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations revenues the following table illustrates revenues from our five business segments for the periods listed below for the year ended december  dermatology xtrac domestic services international dermatology equipment revenues skin care procyte revenues total dermatology revenues surgical surgical services surgical products total surgical revenues total revenues domestic xtrac segment recognized treatment revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively  reflecting billed procedures of   and  respectively 
in addition    and  procedures were performed for the years ended december   and  respectively  without billing from us  in connection with clinical research and customer evaluations of the xtrac laser 
the increase in procedures in the year ended december  compared to the comparable periods in and was largely related to our continuing progress in securing favorable reimbursement policies from private insurance plans and to our increased marketing programs 
increases in procedures are dependent upon building market acceptance through marketing programs with our physician partners and their patients that the xtrac procedures will be of clinical benefit and be generally reimbursed 
we have a program to support certain physicians who may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers for xtrac treatments 
in accordance with the requirements of sab no 
 we recognize service revenue during the program only to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
for the year ended december   we deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program  compared to deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we deferred revenues of  procedures net  under this program 
the change in deferred revenue under this program is presented in the table below 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  domestic xtrac laser sales were  and  respectively 
there were and lasers sold  respectively 
there were no lasers sold for the year ended december  overall  laser sales have been made for various reasons  including costs of logistical support and customer preferences 
we are finding that through sales of lasers we are able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
the following table illustrates the above analysis for the domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  total revenue less laser sales revenue recognized treatment revenue change in deferred program revenue change in deferred unused treatments net billed treatment revenue procedure volume total less non billed procedures net billed procedures avg 
price of treatments sold procedures with deferred program revenue  net procedures with deferred unused treatments  net the average price for a treatment may be reduced in some instances based on the volume of treatments performed 
the average price for a treatment also varies based upon the mix of mild and moderate psoriasis patients treated by our physician partners 
we charge a higher price per treatment for moderate psoriasis patients due to the increased body surface area required to be treated  although there are fewer patients with moderate psoriasis than there are with mild psoriasis 
due to the length of treatment time required  it has not generally been practical to use our therapy to treat severe psoriasis patients  but this may change as our new product  the xtrac ultra  has shorter treatment times 
a study undertaken with the guidance of john koo  md  of the university of california at san francisco  is evaluating the effectiveness of the ultra in treating patients suffering from severe psoriasis 
in march  the bcbsa published a national reference policy that now recommends positive reimbursement coverage for treatment of psoriasis by laser  including the xtrac as first step therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis comprising less than body area 
international dermatology equipment segment international sales of our xtrac and vtrac systems and related parts were  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we sold systems in the year ended december  compared to and systems in the years ended december  and  respectively 
compared to the domestic business  the international dermatology equipment operations are more influenced by competition from similar laser technology from other manufacturers and from non laser lamps 
such competition has caused us at times to reduce the prices we charge to international distributors 
the average price of dermatology equipment sold internationally also varies due to the quantities of refurbished domestic xtrac systems sold and the amount of vtracs sold 
both of these products have lower average selling prices than new xtrac laser systems  however  by adding these to our product offerings along with expanding into new geographic territories where the products are sold  we have been able to increase overall international dermatology equipment revenues 

table of contents we began selling refurbished domestic xtrac laser systems into the international market during the selling price for used equipment is substantially less than new equipment 
we sold five of these used lasers in the year ended december  at an average price of  we sold six of these used lasers  in each year  at an average price of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and we began selling the new vtrac  a lamp based  alternative uvb light source that has a wholesale sales price that is substantially below our competitors international dermatology equipment and below our xtrac laser during in the years ended december  and  we sold and vtrac systems  respectively 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the international xtrac segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues laser and lamp systems sold average revenue per system skin care procyte segment for the year ended december   procyte revenues were  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  inasmuch as procyte was acquired on march   the operating results of procyte for the year ended december  include activity from procyte from march  through december  skin care revenues are generated from the sale of various skin and hair care products  from the sale of copper peptide compound and from royalties on licenses  mainly from neutrogena 
for the full year  unaudited skin care revenues were approximately million 
physician dispensed product revenues  our most strategic and most profitable revenues  increased approximately in over  or about  bulk product and royalty revenues decreased approximately in over  or about  the following table illustrates the key changes in the skin care procyte segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product sales bulk compound sales royalties total skin care revenue surgical services segment in the years ended december   and  surgical service revenues were   and  respectively  representing a increase and a decrease from the comparable prior year periods 
the increases were primarily due to an increase in revenue from urological procedures delivered using a laser system purchased from a third party manufacturer 
such procedures included a charge to the customer for the use of the laser and the technician to operate it  as well as a charge to the customer for the third party s proprietary fiber delivery system 
the decrease from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the six territories that we closed since january   the largest of which was in the fourth quarter of  and business interruption in new orleans and alabama from the hurricanes in august and september operations in two of our territories on the western side of florida were closed due to the termination of a customer contract 
we closed operations in the other four territories for insufficient profitability 

table of contents surgical products segment surgical products revenues include revenues derived from the sales of surgical laser systems together with sales of related laser fibers and laser disposables 
sales of laser systems create recurring sales of laser fibers and laser disposables that are more profitable than laser systems 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was due to  less disposable and fiber sales compared to the prior year period 
also  there was a decline in the average price per laser sold for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
disposables and fiber sales decreased approximately from the comparable year ended december  this is due to the fact that in the year ended december   we had a one time customer order for approximately  in disposables 
we expect that the disposables base may continue to erode over time as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
we have sought to offset this erosion through expansion of our surgical services 
we expect that our oem contract with angiodynamics with initial shipments in december will help grow this segment of the business 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the increase was almost entirely due to  in additional laser system revenues derived from an increase in the number of systems sold vs 
 as partially offset by a decline in the average price per laser sold 
the  in additional laser system revenues was offset  in part  by a decrease in disposable and fiber sales of approximately 
as set forth in the table below  the decrease in average price per laser between the periods was largely due to the mix of lasers sold and partly due to the trade level at which the lasers were sold ie wholesale versus retail 
our diode laser has replaced our nd yag laser  which had a higher sales price 
included in laser sales during the years ended december   and were sales of  and diode lasers  respectively 
the diode lasers have lower sales prices than our other types of lasers  and thus the increase in the number of diodes sold reduced the average price per laser 
we expect that we will continue to sell more diode lasers than our other types of lasers into the near future 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the surgical products segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues percent decrease increase laser systems sold laser system revenues average revenue per laser 
table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues divides into product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues 
within product cost of revenues are the costs of products sold in the international dermatology equipment segment  the skin care segment with royalties included as part of services  and the surgical products segment with laser maintenance included as part of services 
within services cost of revenues are the costs associated with the domestic xtrac segment and the surgical services segment  as well as costs associated with the royalties and maintenance 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase is due to the increases in product cost of sales for domestic xtrac laser sales in the amount of  and international dermatology equipment sales in the amount of  due to increased number of laser sales 
there was also an increase in skincare cost of revenues of  due to increased revenues 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of  for surgical products 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase reflected the cost of sales for the domestic xtrac laser sales of  an increase of  in costs for the procyte business acquired on march   and therefore the operating results of procyte for the year ended december  include activity from procyte from march  through december  additionally there was an increase of  for surgical products  due to increased laser system sales and a  increase in costs associated with sales of xtrac laser equipment sold outside the united states 
services cost of revenues was  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
contributing to the  increase was a  increase in the surgical services business associated with the increase in urological procedures performed with laser systems and fibers purchased from a third party manufacturer  which carry a higher cost of sale rather than equipment and fibers we manufacture 
this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in the cost of revenues in the domestic xtrac business segment of  services cost of revenues was  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
contributing to the  increase was a  increase in the domestic xtrac business segment due to increased depreciation on the lasers of  an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserve and abnormal gas consumption  which has been corrected by software modifications 
additionally there was an increase of  in the cost of revenues for the surgical services business 

table of contents certain allocable xtrac manufacturing overhead costs are charged against the xtrac service revenues 
the manufacturing facility in carlsbad  california is used exclusively for the production of the xtrac lasers  which are placed in physicians offices domestically or sold 
the unabsorbed costs  relating to excess capacity  are allocated to the domestic xtrac and the international dermatology equipment segments based on actual production of lasers for each segment 
included in these allocated manufacturing costs are unabsorbed labor and direct plant costs 
the following table illustrates the key changes in cost of revenues for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product xtrac domestic international dermatology equipment skin care surgical products total product costs services xtrac domestic surgical services total services costs total costs of revenues gross margin analysis gross margin increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margins for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the same period in gross margin increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margins for the year ended december   decreased to compared to for the same period in the following table analyzes changes in our gross margin for the periods reflected below company margin analysis for the year ended december  revenues percent increase cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage the primary reasons for changes in gross profit for the year ended december   compared to the same period in were as follows we sold a greater number of treatment procedures for the xtrac laser systems in than in since each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost  this significantly enhanced profit margins 
the increase in procedure volume was a direct result of improving insurance reimbursement and increased marketing efforts 

table of contents we sold approximately million worth of additional lasers domestically in the year ended december  at high margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated 
we sold approximately  worth of additional international dermatology equipment for the year ended december  compared to the same period in offsetting the above was an increase in depreciation of  included in the xtrac domestic cost of sales as a result of increasing the overall placements of new lasers since the year ended december  the primary reasons for changes in gross profit for the year ended december   compared to the same period in were as follows our skin care business has the highest gross profit percentage of any of our business segments 
however  we acquired procyte on march   and  as such  the operating results of procyte for the year ended december  only included activity from march  through december  we sold a greater number of treatment procedures for the xtrac laser systems in than in each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost 
the increase in procedure volume was a direct result of improving insurance reimbursement and increased marketing efforts 
we sold a greater number of surgical laser systems due to the increased marketing of the diode laser 
these units were primarily sold to our master distributor at a gross margin of approximately 
we sold xtrac laser systems domestically during the year ended december  the gross margin on these sales is higher  approximately  since certain of the lasers were previously being depreciated 
offsetting the above was an increase in depreciation of  included in the xtrac domestic cost of sales as a result of increasing the overall placements of new lasers since the year ended december  in the surgical products segment  unabsorbed labor and overhead plant costs  due to lower production levels  accounted for  of the increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  surgical services revenues decreased due to lost contracts  while costs related to laser repairs increased during the period 
some revenues were lost due to hurricanes 
while we believe a portion of the loss will be covered by insurance  we will not record any expected recovery until we have greater assurance of such recovery 
the following table analyzes the gross profit for our domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below xtrac domestic segment for the year ended december  revenues percent increase cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage 
table of contents the gross profit increased for this segment for the year ended december  from the comparable periods in by  the key factors were as follows key drivers in increased revenue in this segment are insurance reimbursement and increased direct to consumer advertising in targeted territories 
improved insurance reimbursement  together with greater consumer awareness of the xtrac therapy  increased treatment revenue accordingly 
our clinical support specialists have also begun to show favorable impact on increasing physicians utilization of the xtrac laser system 
procedure volume increased from  to  billed procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same period in price per procedure did not change significantly between the periods 
each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost 
we sold approximately million worth of additional domestic xtrac lasers in the year ended december  at high margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated 
the margin on these capital equipment sales was in compared to in the cost of revenues increased by  for the year ended december  this increase is due to additional cost of sales for the lasers sold domestically of approximately  in compared to the same period in the gross profit increased for this segment for the year ended december  from the comparable periods in by  the key factors were as follows we sold xtrac lasers domestically during the year ended december  the gross margin on these sales was approximately  which is higher than overall gross margin of in this segment and which is largely due to the fact that certain of the lasers were previously being depreciated 
a key driver in increased revenue in this segment is insurance reimbursement and increased direct to consumer advertising in targeted territories 
in  several private health insurance plans adopted a favorable policy to cover the medically necessary treatment of psoriasis using our xtrac laser system eg united healthcare  highmark  independence blue cross  empire bcbs  cigna  premera  blue cross of michigan 
these insurers added to the group of companies that had already adopted a favorable policy in in  we increased our level of direct to consumer advertising to recruit patients to dermatologists offices to seek treatment with the xtrac laser system 
while the advertising helped increase revenues  the advertising is also costly 
we continue to analyze and adjust the advertising campaigns for cost effectiveness 
procedure volume increased from  to  procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same period in price per procedure did not change significantly between the periods 
price per procedure was not a meaningful component of the revenue change between the periods 
the cost of revenues increased by  for the year ended december  this increase is due to the cost of sales for the lasers of  and to an increase in depreciation on the lasers in service of  over the comparable prior year period  an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserve and abnormal gas consumption  which has been corrected by software modification 
the depreciation costs will continue to increase in subsequent periods as the business grows 
in addition  there was an increase in certain allocable xtrac manufacturing overhead costs that are charged against the xtrac service revenues

table of contents the following table analyzes our gross margin for our skin care procyte segment for the periods presented below skin care procyte segment for the year ended december  product revenues bulk compound revenues royalties total revenues percent increase product cost of revenues bulk compound cost of revenues total cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage gross profit for the year ended december  increased by  over the comparable period in the key factors in this business segment were as follows the gross margin for our skin care products is relatively consistent from year to year  in and in the increase in total cost of revenues of  in from is directly related to the increases in revenues between the periods 
copper peptide bulk compound is sold at a substantially lower gross margin than skincare products  while revenues generated from licensees have no significant costs associated with this revenue stream 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by  over the comparable period in the key factors impacting gross profit were as follows skin care procyte business was acquired on march  and  as such  the operating results of procyte for the year ended december  only included activity from march  through december  the gross margin for our skin care products is relatively consistent from year to year in and in the increase in total cost of revenues of  in from is directly related to the increases in revenues between the periods 

table of contents the following table analyzes the gross profit for our surgical services segment for the periods reflected below surgical services segment for the year ended december  revenues percent increase decrease cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage gross profit in the surgical services segment for year ended december  decreased by  from the comparable period in the key factors impacting gross margin for the surgical services business were as follows for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we incurred incremental costs in technicians of  and outside contractors of  and incremental depreciation of  these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in repairs of  although our revenues have increased by  our product cost of revenue has increased 
this is due to a continuing change in the mix of procedures performed 
a certain urological procedure performed on a laser purchased from an unrelated party has increased as a percentage of revenue from this procedure has a lower gross margin than margins obtained from procedures performed on lasers manufactured by us 
gross profit in the surgical services segment for year ended december  decreased by  from the comparable period in the key factors impacting gross margin for the surgical services business were as follows we have closed business operations in six territories due to unacceptable operating profit and in one additional territory due to competition 
although closing these unprofitable territories will save costs and improve profitability over time  the overall costs saved for the year ended december  have not kept pace with the revenues lost 
nevertheless  in the case of the territory lost to competition  we have opened a new  contiguous territory in which we have secured a long term contract from which we anticipate significant procedure volume 
for that reason  we have relocated our personnel and material from the lost territory to the new one 
our product cost percentage has increased due to a change in the mix of procedures performed 
a certain urological procedure performed on a laser purchased from an unrelated party has increased as a percentage of revenue from this procedure has a lower gross margin than margins obtained from procedures performed on lasers manufactured by us 

table of contents the following table analyzes our gross profit for our surgical products segment for the periods reflected below surgical products segment for the year ended december  revenues percent decrease increase cost of revenues percent decrease increase gross profit gross margin percentage the gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by  from the comparable prior year period 
the key factors in this business segment were as follows this segment includes product sales of surgical laser systems and laser disposables 
disposables are more profitable than laser systems  but the sale of laser systems generates the subsequent recurring sale of laser disposables 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased by  from the year ended december  while cost of revenues decreased by  between the same periods 
there were more laser systems sold in the year ended december  than in the comparable period of however  the lasers sold in the period were at higher prices than those sold in the comparable period in the decrease in average price per laser was largely due to the mix of lasers sold and volume discounts 
included in the laser sales for the year ended december  and were sales of  representing systems  and  representing systems  of diode lasers  respectively  which have substantially lower list sales prices than the other types of surgical lasers 
additionally there was a decrease in sales of disposables between the periods 
fiber and other disposables sales decreased between the comparable periods ended december  and this is due in part to having a one time order of approximately  in the year ended december  the gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by  from the comparable prior year period

unabsorbed labor and overhead plant costs  due to lower production levels  accounted for  of the increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  
table of contents this revenue increase was partly offset by a decrease in azurtec project revenues of  and a decrease in sales of disposables between the periods 
the azurtec revenues recognized in had substantially no associated direct costs 
disposables  which have a higher gross margin as a percent of revenues than lasers  represented a higher percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to the same period in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  for the year ended december  we have increased our investment in sales and marketing to respond to the improved reimbursement environment related to our domestic xtrac business 
we expect this investment to increase future revenues  the majority of the increase related to a  increase in salaries  benefits and travel expenses associated with an increase in the sales force and increased revenues  particularly in the domestic xtrac segment  an increase of  in salaries  benefits and travel expenses associated with an increase in the marketing team  particularly in the domestic xtrac segment  an increase of  for legal expenses  an increase of  in outside services and consulting expenses  an increase of  in additional warranty expense due to the increase in lasers sold  and these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in commercial  workers compensation and directors and officers liability insurance of for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses related to the procyte business accounted for  of the increase 
this is due to the acquisition which occurred on march   so only expenses from march  through december  were included 
the remaining increase related to a  increase in salaries  benefits and travel expenses associated with an increase in the sales force  particularly in the domestic xtrac segment  an increase in direct to consumer advertising of  an increase in royalties to mount sinai of  an increase in bonus accrual of  an increase of  for legal expenses  an increase of  for stock based compensation expense following adoption of sfas no 
r see note  stock based compensation and  for stock options issued to consultants  and these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of  engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salaries and related benefits of  due to reduced headcount 
during the and periods  the engineers at the carlsbad plant were primarily focused on manufacturing efforts  and therefore  their costs have been reflected in cost of goods sold

table of contents other income other income for the year ended december  was  reflecting the following components a litigation settlement  net of expenses  of  a non monetary exchange of assets during june of two depreciable engineering development prototypes in exchange for four product units to be held for sale for  and the expiration  and therefore reversal  of the liability for slt subordinated notes of  there was no other income in the comparable periods in and refinancing charge refinancing charge for the year ended december  was due to the termination of the lending arrangements with both ge capital corporation and leaf financial 
this included  for prepayment penalties   buyback of warrants previously issued to ge  and  of unamortized costs for previous draws on the line of credit 
these costs were incurred in order to obtain a new credit facility with cit in terms more favorable to us 
interest expense  net net interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in net interest expense was the result of the draws on the lease line of credit during the year ended december  and the first and second quarters of this was offset by the increase in interest income earned on the funds from the private placement in november net interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in net interest expense was the result of the draws on the lease line of credit during the year ended december  and the first  second and third quarters of net loss the aforementioned factors resulted in a net loss of  during the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues of which resulted in an increase in gross margin of  or 
this increase was offset  in part by increases in personnel for sales and marketing in the domestic xtrac segment of the business  a charge to expense of  due to the costs involved in refinancing of the ge and leaf financial corporation leaf credit facilities  and an increase of  of depreciation  substantially all of which is included in costs of goods sold  and amortization over the comparable period of the prior year 

table of contents the following table illustrates the impact of the three components between the periods for the year ended december  change net loss components included in net loss refinancing charge depreciation and amortization expense stock based compensation expense the aforementioned factors resulted in a net loss of  during the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the result of the other income for the year ended december  of the increase in cost of sales and resulting decrease in gross margin  due to stock option expense of  following the adoption of sfas no

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with cash provided by equity financing and from lines of credit and  more recently  from positive cash flow generated from operations 
at december   our current ratio was compared to at december  as of december   we had  of working capital compared to  as of december  cash and cash equivalents were  as of december   as compared to  as of december  we had  of cash that was classified as restricted as of december  compared to  as of december  
table of contents we believe that our existing cash balance together with our other existing financial resources  including access to debt financing for capital expenditures  and revenues from sales  distribution  licensing and manufacturing relationships  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements beyond the second quarter of the operating plan reflects increases in per treatment fee revenues for use of the xtrac system based on increased utilization of the xtrac by physicians and on wider insurance coverage in the united states 
in addition  the operating plan calls for increased revenues and profits from our skin care business 
on december   we entered into a term note credit facility from cit healthcare and life sciences capital collectively cit 
the credit facility has a commitment term of one year  expiring on december  we account for each draw as funded indebtedness  with ownership in the lasers remaining with us 
cit holds a security interest in the lasers 
each draw against the credit facility has a repayment period of three years 
a summary of the activity under the cit credit facility is presented in note  long term debt of the financial statements included in this report 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  the decrease was mostly due to the increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to cash used of  for the same period in the change was primarily due to a decrease in inventory 
in the prior year  significant inventory purchases were made of copper peptide in the skincare products segment and in launching the diode program in the surgical products segment 
increases in sales in these segments in  reduced the inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this was primarily for the placement of lasers into service 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  this change was mostly the result of receiving cash of  net of costs  in the acquisition of procyte in of this increase in cash from the acquisition  we used  for production of our lasers in service compared to  in when we retire a laser from service  we transfer the laser into inventory and then write off the net book value of the laser  which is typically negligible 
over the last three years  the retirements of lasers from service have been minor or immaterial and  therefore  they are reported with placements on a net basis 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  in the year ended december  we received  from the advances under the lease and term note lines of credit  net of payments   from the exercise of common stock options and a decrease in restricted cash of  these cash receipts were offset by  for the payment of certain notes payable and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  in the year ended december  we received  net from the issuance of common stock   from the advances under the lease line of credit  net of payments   from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and a decrease in restricted cash of  these cash receipts were offset by  for the payment of certain notes payable and capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations set forth below is a summary of current obligations as of december  to make future payments due by the period indicated below  excluding payables and accruals 
we expect to be able to meet our obligations in the ordinary course 
the obligations under the credit facility from cit healthcare and life sciences capital are term notes 
the capital lease obligations are from transactions entered into for the surgical services division 
operating lease and rental obligations are respectively for personal and real property which we use in our business 

table of contents payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years credit facility obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations rental obligations notes payable total our ability to expand our business operations is currently dependent in significant part on financing from external sources 
there can be no assurance that changes in our manufacturing and marketing  research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses and business strategy will not require financing from external sources before we will be able to develop profitable operations 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of marketing results  product testing  changes in the focus and direction of our marketing programs  competitive and technological advances  the level of working capital required to sustain our planned growth  litigation  operating results  including the extent and duration of operating losses  and other factors 
in the event that we experience the need for additional capital  and are not able to generate capital from financing sources or from future operations  management may be required to modify  suspend or discontinue our business plan 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation we have not operated in a highly inflationary period  and we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are not currently exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates and  therefore  we do not use derivative financial instruments to address risk management issues in connection with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates
