description of business we are a publicly traded specialty risk management organization offering a full range of insurance products and services  focused on niche and specialty program business  which we believe is under served by the standard insurance market 
program business refers to an aggregation of individually underwritten risks that have some unique characteristic and are distributed through a select group of focused general agencies  retail agencies and program administrators 
we perform the majority of underwriting and claims services associated with these programs 
we also provide property and casualty insurance coverage and services through programs and specialty risk management solutions for agents  professional and trade associations  public entities and small to medium sized insureds 
in addition  we also operate as an insurance agency representing unaffiliated insurance companies in placing insurance coverages for policyholders 
we define our business segments as specialty risk management operations and agency operations 
in july  we completed an offering of  additional shares of newly issued common stock at per share 
the gross proceeds of the offering were million 
the net proceeds were million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being utilized to support organic growth within our underwriting operations  to fund select acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
upon receipt of the net proceeds  we also reduced our outstanding line of credit balance from million to zero 
in june  we sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of million 
we utilized million of the million raised in the public offering to pay down our line of credit by million and contributed million to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
since  we have issued million and million in junior subordinated debentures and senior debentures  respectively 
we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuances of these debentures  of which million was contributed to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
these debentures are callable after five years 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued from the date of issuance 
since the junior subordinated debentures issued in are callable in  we will be reviewing the capital strategy associated with refinancing at lower costs through debentures or equity 
specialty risk management operations our specialty risk management operations segment  which includes insurance company specialty programs and fee for service specialty programs  focuses on specialty or niche insurance business 
specialty risk management operations provide services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  and inland marine 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages the specialty risk management operations provides within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
with a fee for service program  or managed program  we earn fee for service revenue by providing management and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results of the program 
the fees we receive from these programs are generally either a fixed amount or based on a percentage of premium serviced or claim count 
we provide three broad types of insurance company programs  including fully insured  captives and client risk sharing programs 
with a client risk sharing program  our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite individual primary insurance policies for members of a group or association  or a specific industry and then share the operating results with the client or client group through a reinsurance agreement with a captive or rent a captive 
in some instances  a captive owned by a client or client group reinsures a portion of the risk on a quota share basis 
a captive is an insurance company or reinsurance company  which is formed for the purpose of insuring or reinsuring risks related to the businesses of its shareholders or members 
a rent a captive allows organizations to obtain the benefits of a captive insurance company  without the initial costs and capital investment required to form their own captive 
this is often an interim step utilized by groups and associations prior to forming their own captive 
as part of its participation in a rent a captive  the client group purchases redeemable preferred stock of our unconsolidated subsidiary 
these shares entitle the client group to participate in profits and losses of the program through a dividend or additional capital contribution 
dividends or additional capital contributions are determined and accrued on the basis of underwriting profits or losses plus investment income on trust accounts less costs 
the captive and rent a captive structures are licensed reinsurance companies  which have a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets  and are in the reinsurance business for the purpose of providing a return to their investors  who are the shareholders primary beneficiaries of the captive company 
the primary beneficiaries have their own equity at risk  decision making authority  and the ability to absorb losses 
therefore  the transactions associated with the captive and rent a captive structures are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in addition to premium revenue and investment income from our net retained portion of the operating results  we may also be compensated through the receipt of fees for policy issuance services and acquisition costs  captive administration  reinsurance placement  loss prevention services  and claims administrative and handling services 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through a ceding commission 
for financial reporting purposes  ceding commissions are treated as a reduction in underwriting expenses 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued with fully insured programs  we provide our insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are generally developed in response to specific market opportunities and may evolve into a risk sharing arrangement 
agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agencies  located in michigan  california  and florida 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 
the agency produces an immaterial amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains specialty risk management agency operations holding company interest income earned intersegment revenue consolidated revenue critical accounting policies general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represent case based estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
components of losses and loss adjustment expense the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed retroceded assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business allocated to individual insurance company writers based on the insurer s market share in a given state 
the reserves referenced in the above table related to our direct and assumed business  which we directly manage and are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
accordingly  the case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no delay or lag in reporting of losses from a ceding company  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag between the date of the evaluation and the receipt of the estimate from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  and include an estimated reserve based upon actuarial methods for this lag 
assumed business  which is subsequently retroceded to participating reinsurers  relates to business previously discontinued and now is in run off 
relative to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received from cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total claim reserving process and methodology when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  which focus on the ultimate probable cost of each reported claim  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
in developing claim and claim adjustment expense loss es reserve estimates  we perform a complete and detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform this analysis the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it may be a particular geographical area within a line of business such as nevada workers compensation 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as either short tail or long tail 
about ninety eight percent of our reserves can be characterized as coming from long tail lines of business 
for long tail business  several years may lapse between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include workers compensation  commercial automobile liability  general liability  professional liability  products liability  excess  and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  and inland marine 
the analyses generally review losses both gross and net of reinsurance 
the standard actuarial methods that we use to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method  incurred development method  paid bornhuetter ferguson method  reported bornhuetter ferguson method  initial expected loss method  
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued paid roll forward method  and incurred roll forward method all of these methods are consistently applied to every reserve category where they are applicable and they create indications for each accident year 
we use judgment selecting the best estimate from within these estimates or adjusted estimates 
as such  no one method or group of methods is strictly used for any line of business or reserve category within a line of business 
the individual selections by year are our best judgments based on the strengths and weaknesses of the method  indications  the inherent variability in the data and the specific modifications to selections for data characteristics 
a brief description of the methods and some discussion of their inherent strengths  weaknesses and uses are as follows paid development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
incurred development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment and case reserving environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
since the method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on adjusting prior accident year projections to the current accident year levels using underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments specific to the line of business 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
paid roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual paid loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it is useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns 
incurred roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual case incurred loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it may also be useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns and generally reacts faster than the paid roll forward method 
claims for short tail lines of business settle more quickly than long tail lines of business  and in general  loss development factors for short tail lines are smaller than long tail lines 
for long tail lines  we tend to rely on initial expected loss methods throughout the current accident year then move to development factor based methods for older accident years 
development methods on short tail lines are generally reliable in the third and fourth quarter of the initial accident year and recorded loss ratios reflect a blend of the development and forecast methods 
short tail lines represent two percent of our total reserves at december  the reserve categories where the above methods are not applicable are few 
the largest of these is our workers compensation residual market reserve category  where we utilize detailed reserve analyses performed by the industry statistical agency ncci in making our estimates 
we adjust these estimates for timing differences in the reporting of the data 
the other reserve categories that deviate from the above methods are smaller  as a group constituting less than three percent of the total reserves 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
for all but the initial expected loss method  the key assumptions are the patterns with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time development patterns 
these patterns incorporate inherent assumptions of claims cost inflation rates and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
these are affected by underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments which are explicit key assumptions underlying the initial expected loss method 
each of these key assumptions is discussed in the following paragraphs 
to analyze the development patterns  we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical development patterns 
to the extent that the historical data may provide insufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our insurance companies historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the losses and lae reserves at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  the new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop for many years and at times  decades in the future 
when it is likely the actual development will occur in the distant future  the potential for actual development to differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections is increased 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
in particular  the development factor based methods all have as a key assumption that the development of losses in the future will follow a pattern similar to those measured by past experience and as adjusted either explicitly or by actuarial judgment 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple and varied factors 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and variability of claim reserve estimates by its nature  the estimate of ultimate loss and lae is subject to variability due to differences between our assumptions and actual events in the future 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate the values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of the future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analyses to perform the necessary adjustments 
one implicit assumption underlying development patterns is that the claims inflation trends will continue into the future similar to their past patterns 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  the actuarial department derived expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary variance of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
general inflation trends have been fairly stable over the past several years but there have been fluctuations of one to two percent over the past ten years and therefore we used a one percent annual inflation variance factor 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was a three percent change in reserve adequacy or approximately million effect on after tax net income 
a variance of this type would 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
an explicit assumption used in the analysis is the set of initial expected loss ratios ielrs used in the current accident year reserve projections and in some of the prior accident year ultimate loss indications 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss to a change in ielrs  the actuarial department recasted the loss reserve indications using a set of ielrs all one percent higher than the final ielrs 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was less than a one percent change in reserve adequacy or a million effect on after tax net income 
often the loss ratios by line of business will vary from the ielr in different directions causing them to partially offset each other 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
the other factors having influence upon the loss and lae reserve levels are too numerous and interdependent to efficiently model and test for sensitivity 
likewise  the development factors by reserve category and age are too numerous to model and test for sensitivity 
instead  ranges are estimated by reserve category considering past history  fluctuations in the development patterns  emerging issues  trends and other factors 
the ranges are compiled and the total range is estimated considering the sensitivity to all of the underlying factors together 
the resulting range is our best estimate of the expected ongoing variability in the loss reserves 
historic development as shown within the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development table has been three percent or less in the last two years but was ten to thirty three percent in the years prior to the underwriting and reserving shift in at that time  we concentrated our efforts on eliminating underwriting relationships where we had substantial liabilities above an aggregate exposure retained by risk sharing associations and captives 
for a large share of our business  we also accelerated the pace at which we brought the claim administration to our employees and away from outside third party administrators 
this enabled us to rapidly recognize trends and underlying loss patterns  while being able to quickly set more accurate reserves 
our range of estimates table shows that presently we evaluate it as going from favorable development of to unfavorable of 
the range was evaluated based on the ultimate loss estimates from the actuarial methods described above

our workers compensation reserves represent percent of our total reserves at december  workers compensation was our first line of business and is still our largest 
the sensitivity around our commercial multiple peril general liability reserves primarily reflects the longer duration of reserves relating to our liability excess program which started in and currently represents of the million reserves in this line of business  as of december  
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the sensitivity around our commercial automobile reserves primarily reflects the speed of reporting of the underlying losses  as well as the maturity of the case law surrounding automobile liability 
the sensitivity around the other lines of business primarily reflects the size of the underlying book of business 
our other reserves represent of total reserves at december  the majority of these reserves represent professional liability programs which tend to be claims made and reinsured at lower limits  therefore reducing the volatility that is inherent in a smaller book of business 
all of our reserves are sensitive to changes in the underlying claim payment and case reserving practices  as well as the other sources of variations mentioned above 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which may be in dispute 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
investments and other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if there is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost and the decline is considered other than temporary  the amount of decline below cost is charged to earnings 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
our investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
our policy for the valuation of temporarily 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of  but not limited to  the following factors rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in income 
there were no impaired investments written down in   and there can be no assurance  however  that significant changes in the above factors in relation to our investment portfolio  will not result in future impairment charges 
our investment portfolio includes investments in mortgage backed and agency backed securities  however we do not have any direct exposure to any sub prime risks 
our asset backed securities sector comprises only  or million of our investment portfolio 
within this sector  million relates to home equity loans  of which million is insured 
the remaining million primarily relates to credit cards  auto loans  and utility and equipment loans 
these asset backed securities are adequately collateralized  aaa rated investment quality that we currently expect will continue to perform 
our mortgage backed securities have no exposure to any sub prime risks 
at december  and  we had and securities that were in an unrealized loss position  respectively 
these investments all had unrealized losses of less than ten percent 
at december   of those investments  with an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
at december   of those investments  with an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize premiums written as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of an in force policy 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
for the year ending december   total assumed written premiums were million  of which million  relates to assumed business we manage directly  and therefore  no estimation is involved 
the remaining million of assumed written premiums includes million related to residual markets 
assumed premium estimates are specifically related to the mandatory assumed pool business from the ncci  or residual market business 
the pools cede workers compensation business to participating companies based upon the individual company s market share by state 
the activity is reported from the ncci to participating companies on a two quarter lag 
to accommodate this lag  we estimate premium and loss activity based on historical and market based results 
historically  we have not experienced any material difficulties or disputes in collecting balances from ncci  and therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded related to the assumed premium estimate 
in addition  certain premiums are subject to retrospective premium adjustments 
premium is recognized over the term of the insurance contract 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims administration services  is recognized in the period the services are provided 
claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the contractually defined termination date of the related contracts  fees are deferred in an amount equal to an estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of any sub producer commission expense 
any commission adjustments that occur subsequent to the earnings process are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in our consolidated financial statements 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries acquired 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and  at least annually  we test all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
our annual assessment date for goodwill impairment testing is october st 
we test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment to goodwill 
we carry goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill impairment  we determined that no impairment to goodwill exists

management s discussion and analysis continued results of operations executive overview our overall results in continued to reflect growth of net income in comparison to prior year 
these improvements reflect our commitment to selective growth  as well as our adherence to strict corporate underwriting guidelines and price adequacy 
we continue to maintain strong underwriting discipline and growth within our profitable programs 
our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to in from in we also continue to experience solid growth in our fee based operations 
net operating income  excluding amortization  increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in gross written premium increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in our existing underwritten business  which excludes residual market premium  was up million  or in comparison to this growth included business from new programs implemented in the growth in existing business was slightly offset by a reduction in residual market premiums that are assigned to us as a result of a decrease in the estimate of the overall size of the residual market 
we continue to follow pricing guidelines mandated by our corporate underwriting guidelines 
overall  our year to date rate change was down  compared to industry average price decreases of approximately 
we anticipate that rates will continue to remain slightly down into we continue to be selective on new program implementation by focusing only on those programs that meet our underwriting guidelines and have a proven history of profitability 
our statutory surplus increased by million in to million  from million in currently  our earned surplus is million  which represents our ability to dividend from the insurance company subsidiaries to our holding company for capital strategies  such as acquisitions  dividends  debt repayments  and share repurchases 
in april  we received an upgrade of our financial strength rating by am best company to a excellent  from b very good for our insurance company subsidiaries 
this rating upgrade validates our commitment to create value through excellent underwriting and consistent operating performance 
we are continuing to implement new insurance programs as a result of this upgrade from am best and other business development strategies 
we have a comprehensive due diligence process that incorporates an entity wide risk analysis  as well as an operational review 
while this process can be lengthy  we believe the initial work leads to long term relationships with solid longer term favorable underwriting performance 
we believe we are in a good position to achieve our top line and bottom line growth objectives in in addition  subsequent to the am best upgrade  we have renewed policies formerly written on a fronted basis by a non affiliated insurance company and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries in exchange for a fronting fee 
as this renewal process continues and we earn the premium previously fronted  we expect to see this reduction in cost reflected within our expense ratio 
in april  we purchased certain business assets of us specialty underwriters  inc ussu for a purchase price of million 
this purchase price was comprised of million in cash and million in our common stock 
ussu is based in cleveland  ohio  and is a specialty program manager that produces fee based income by underwriting excess workers compensation coverage for a select group of insurance companies 
the total shares issued for the million portion of the purchase price was  shares 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the excess workers compensation business and other related assets 
in addition  we entered into a management agreement with the shareholders of ussu 
under the terms and conditions of the management agreement  the shareholders were responsible for certain aspects of the administration and management of the acquired business 
the shareholders consideration for the performance of their duties was in the form of a management fee payable by us based on a share of net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
in addition  we retained the option to terminate the management agreement  at our discretion  based on a multiple of the management fee calculated for the trailing twelve

on january   we exercised our option to purchase the remainder of the economics related to the acquisition of the ussu business  by eliminating the management agreement for a payment of million  which now completes the transaction 
in july  we completed an offering of  additional shares of newly issued common stock at per share 
the gross proceeds of the offering were million 
the net proceeds were million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being utilized to support organic growth within our underwriting operations  to fund select acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
upon receipt of the net proceeds  we reduced our outstanding line of credit balance from million to zero 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share 
this is the first quarterly dividend since the third quarter of our board of directors determined that reinstating the dividend best serves shareholder interests by creating long term value and is part of our capital management strategy 
on february   we executed a definitive merger agreement with procentury corporation procentury for a merger transaction valued at approximately million in cash and stock to be paid to procentury shareholders 
the combined entity will adopt and operate under the meadowbrook name and will continue to trade on the nyse under the ticker symbol mig 
our chief executive officer  robert s 
cubbin  will continue in his current role in the post merger combined entity and two procentury board members are expected to join meadowbrook s board of directors 
the merger is expected to expand and complement our specialty lines capabilities with procentury s insurance professionals and product expertise in the excess and surplus lines market 
we believe there are significant profitable revenue growth opportunities  as well as cost savings opportunities 
we expect to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash and debt 
completion of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions  including the receipt of required regulatory and shareholder approval 
we expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement primarily reflects growth in underwriting profits and an increase in net investment income 
net investment income increased primarily from an overall increase in average invested assets 
improvements in our overall underwriting results reflect continued favorable development on prior year losses and a slight reduction in the expense ratio 
these improvements were partially offset by amortization of intangibles and interest expense associated with our acquisition of the ussu business 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums was the result of selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy  partially offset by a reduction in residual market premiums that are assigned to us as a result of a decrease in the estimate of the overall size of the residual market 
the increase in revenue was also due to an overall increase in fee for service revenue  primarily as a result of our acquisition of the ussu business

total fees received in as a result of the ussu acquisition were million 
slightly offsetting these fees was a slight decrease in fees in our northeast operations 
this decrease in fees primarily related to a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  because of mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition

the invested proceeds from the equity offering added approximately  to the overall net investment income for the year 
the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was

both and  were adversely impacted by a single large workers compensation claim 
the increase was million and  in and  respectively 
excluding the adverse impact of this claim  overall workers compensation reflected improvement in claim settlements relative to their collective case reserves

management s discussion and analysis continued we experienced approximately million in adverse development related to allowances on reinsurance recoverables 
our expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
the increase in our expense ratio in comparison to reflects a reduction in an accrual for estimated profit based ceding commissions on an excess reinsurance treaty for a specific commercial transportation program 
this decrease was the result of unfavorable loss development on a limited number of excess of loss claims from prior accident years and added million to our expenses  or percentage points to our expense ratio for the year  as compared to a favorable impact on the expense ratio of million  or percentage points 
as of december   the remaining accrual was less than  therefore  we do not anticipate any further unfavorable adjustments 
offsetting this increase in the expense ratio was a reduction in insurance related assessments primarily related to the guaranty fund in florida and nevada 
agency operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations from our agency operations in thousands for the years ended december  net commission pre tax income our agency operations include an allocation of corporate overhead  which includes expenses associated with accounting  information services  legal  and other corporate services

agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in the pre tax income was primarily attributable to the decrease in agency commission revenue mentioned above 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of the november acquisition of a florida based retail agency and an increase in profit sharing commissions in comparison to offsetting these increases was a decrease in commission revenue as a result of a reduction in premium on client renewals due to a more competitive pricing environment 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in this decrease in pre tax income in comparison to was primarily the result of a slight increase in operating expenses coupled with the decrease in commission revenue  as noted above  offset by the favorable impact from the florida based retail agency acquisition 
other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum reserve maximum reserve line of business range range selected reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets reserves are reviewed by our internal actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and for the year ended december   we reported a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december  the decrease in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity

this net overall decrease reflects decreases of million  million  million   and million in accident years     and  respectively 
these decreases reflect better than expected experience for many of our workers compensation programs  including those in nevada  florida  and a multi state association program 
the actual losses on reported claims were less than the prior actuarial projections and  therefore  ultimate loss estimates were reduced 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial multiple peril general liability the commercial multiple peril and general liability line of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves

management s discussion and analysis continued expected claim emergence in a florida based program 
the larger than expected claim emergence within this florida based program was the result of accelerated claim activity on a handful of incurred losses and greater claims frequency from a claim reserving process change 
this may be attributable to more aggressive investigation on possible losses and more dedicated resources on claim handling  resulting in case reserving changes  rather than worsening results 
while this program had unfavorable development in prior accident year reserves  the current and inception to date profits remain positive and within our corporate guidelines for return on surplus 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business increased  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall increase reflects increases of million and million in accident years and  respectively

residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net reserves 
this decrease reflects reductions of million   and  in accident years  and  respectively 
we record loss reserves as reported by the ncci  plus a provision for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the quarter 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to merit increases  our acquisition of the ussu business  and variable compensation attributable to our performance 
overall  our headcount remained flat for salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects an increase in variable compensation

partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in payments related to policy acquisition costs and insurance related assessments 
non regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in cash flow from operations is primarily the result of an increase in the collection of commission and fees due to the ussu business acquisition 
this increase in cash flow was partially offset by variable compensation payments related to our long term incentive plan  which were made in the first quarter of and related to performance and profitability 
we continue to anticipate a temporary increase in cash outflows related to our investments in technology as we enhance our operating systems and controls 
we believe these temporary increases will not affect our liquidity  debt covenants  or other key financial measures 
compared to regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily the result of timing in relation to reinsurance payments

the issuance costs associated with these debentures have been capitalized and are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
as of june   these issuance costs were being amortized over a seven year period as a component of interest expense 
the seven year amortization period represented management s best estimate of the estimated useful life of the bonds related to both the senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures 
beginning july   we reevaluated our best estimate and determined a five year amortization period to be a more accurate representation of the estimated useful life 
therefore  this change in amortization period from seven years to five years has been applied prospectively beginning july  the junior subordinated debentures issued in and  were issued in conjunction with the issuance of million and million in mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities to a trust formed by an institutional investor from our unconsolidated subsidiary trusts  respectively

revolving line of credit in april  we executed an amendment to our current revolving credit agreement with our bank 
the amendments included an extension of the term to september   an increase to the available borrowings of up to million  and a reduction of the variable interest rate basis to a range between to basis points above libor 
we use the revolving line of credit to meet short term working capital needs 
under the revolving line of credit  we and certain of our non regulated subsidiaries pledged security interests in certain property and assets of named subsidiaries 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit 
in july  we completed a secondary equity offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
upon receipt of the net proceeds  we reduced our outstanding line of credit balance to zero 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million on the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit provides for interest at a variable rate based  at our option  upon either a prime based rate or libor based rate 
in addition  the revolving line of credit also provides for an unused facility fee of basis points on any unused balance 
on prime based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points below prime 
on libor based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points above libor 
the margin for all loans is dependent on the sum of non regulated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash impairment charges related to intangible assets for the preceding four quarters  plus dividends paid or payable to us from subsidiaries during such period adjusted ebitda

our asset backed securities sector comprises only  or million of our investment portfolio 
within this sector  million relates to home equity loans  of which million is insured 
the remaining million primarily relates to credit cards  auto loans  and utility and equipment loans 
these asset backed securities are adequately collateralized  aaa rated investment quality that we currently expect will continue to perform 
our mortgage backed securities have no exposure to any sub prime risks 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased to million  or a book value of per common share  at december   compared to million  or a book value of per common share  at december  this per share increase in book value primarily reflects the impact of our equity offering in july  year to date earnings  and an increase in unrealized gains  net of deferred income tax  of million 
return on beginning equity was in  compared to in on july   we completed a secondary offering of  additional shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
including the underwriting discount associated with the offering and other related expenses  we received total net proceeds of approximately million 
these net proceeds are being utilized to support organic growth within our underwriting operations  to fund select acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
upon receipt of the net proceeds  we reduced our outstanding line of credit balance from million to zero 
in april  we purchased the business of ussu for a purchase price of million 
this purchased price was comprised of million in cash and million in our common stock 
total additional shares issued for the million portion of the purchase price were  shares 
on february   our board of directors and the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the distribution of our ltip award for the plan years  which included both a cash and stock award 
the stock portion of the ltip award was valued at million  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
of the  shares issued   shares were retired for payment of the participant s associated withholding taxes related to the compensation recognized by the participant 
refer to note stock options  long term incentive plan  and deferred compensation plan for further detail 
the retirement of the shares for the associated withholding taxes reduced our paid in capital by million 
on october   our board of directors authorized management to purchase up to  shares  or approximately  of our common stock in market transactions for a period not to exceed twenty four months 
our prior plan expired on october  for the years ended december  and  we did not repurchase any common stock under either plan 
as of december   we have available up to  shares to be purchased 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share 
the dividend is payable on march   to shareholders of record as of march  our board of directors did not declare any dividends in or when evaluating the declaration of a dividend  our board of directors considers a variety of factors  including but not limited to  our cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations and our overall financial condition 
as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries 
we did not receive any dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries in or

management s discussion and analysis continued acquisition in april  we acquired the business of ussu for a purchase price of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the excess workers compensation business and other related assets 
ussu is based in cleveland  ohio  and is a specialty program manager that produces fee based income by underwriting excess workers compensation coverage for a select group of insurance companies 
goodwill associated with this acquisition was approximately million 
in addition  we recorded an increase to other intangible assets of approximately million 
these other intangible assets related to customer relationships acquired with the acquisition 
we determined that the estimated useful life of the other intangible assets to be approximately five years 
as such  we will amortize the million in other intangible assets over a five year period 
in addition  we entered into a management agreement with the former owners of ussu 
under the terms the management agreement  the former owners were responsible for certain aspects of the daily administration and management of the ussu business 
their consideration for the performance of these duties was in the form of a management fee payable by us based on a share of net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
we retained the option to terminate the management agreement  at our discretion  based on a multiple of the management fee calculated for the trailing twelve months 
on january   we exercised this option to purchase the remainder of the economics related to the acquisition of the ussu business  by eliminating the management agreement for a payment of million  which now completes the transaction 
as a result of this purchase  we recorded an increase to other intangible assets of approximately million and an increase to goodwill of approximately million 
adjusted expense ratio included in our gaap expense ratio is the impact of the margin associated with our fee based operations 
if the profit margin from our fee for service business is recognized as an offset to our underwriting expense  a more realistic picture of our operating efficiency emerges

regulatory a significant portion of our consolidated assets represent assets of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the state of michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis  restricts the amount of funds that may be transferred to us in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
these restrictions in general  are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance company subsidiaries surplus 
at december   star s earned surplus position was positive million 
at december   star had positive earned surplus of million 
based upon star s statutory financial statements as of december   star would have the potential to pay a dividend of up to million without the prior approval of ofis 
no statutory dividends were paid during or

estimates of interest expense for future periods are based on the most current interest rates in effect on million senior debentures at  on million senior debentures at  on million junior subordinated debentures at  and on million junior subordinated debentures at 
the assumption that the loans will be repaid at the end of seven years is based on management s best estimate of the life of the debentures 
in addition  there are two interest rate swaps associated with our long term debt 
the first interest rate swap relates to million of our million of senior debentures  which has a fixed interest rate of with an ending date of may  the second interest rate swap relates to million of our million junior subordinated debentures  which has a fixed interest rate of with an ending date of september  consists of rental obligations under real estate leases related to branch offices 
in addition  includes amounts related to equipment leases 
the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years  to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
we maintain an investment portfolio with varying maturities that we believe will provide adequate cash for the payment of claims 
variable compensation we have established two variable compensation plans as an incentive for performance of our management team 
they consist of an annual bonus plan bonus plan and a long term incentive plan ltip 
the 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued bonus plan is a discretionary cash bonus plan premised upon a targeted growth in net after tax earnings on a year over year basis 
each year  the compensation committee and our board of directors establish a new target based upon prior year performance and the forecasted performance levels anticipated for the following year 
the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
at the end of the year  the compensation committee and the board of directors review our performance in relation to performance targets and then establish the total bonus pool to be utilized to pay cash bonuses to the management team based upon overall corporate and individual participant goals 
the ltip is intended to provide an incentive to management to improve our performance over a three year period  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the ltip is not discretionary and is based upon a target for an average three year return on beginning equity 
if the targets are met and all other terms and conditions are satisfied  the ltip awards are paid 
the ltip is paid in cash and in stock 
a participant s percentage is established by the compensation committee and the board of directors in advance of any new three year ltip award 
the stock component of the ltip is paid based upon the closing stock price at the beginning of the three year ltip performance period  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ltip 
both the bonus plan and the ltip are administered by the compensation committee and all awards are reviewed and approved by the board of directors at both inception and at distribution 
regulatory and rating issues the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
at december   each of our insurance company subsidiaries was in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required 
insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
our targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries did not generate any ratios that departed from the usual value range 
in april  we received an upgrade of our financial strength rating by am best company to a excellent  from b very good for our insurance company subsidiaries

management s discussion and analysis continued reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in regard to our excess of loss reinsurance  we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective or existing reinsurers 
we generally do not seek collateral where the reinsurer is rated a or better by a

we customarily collateralize reinsurance balances due from non admitted reinsurers through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential exposure to uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility

intercompany pooling agreement intercompany pooling or reinsurance agreements are commonly entered into between affiliated insurance companies  so as to allow the companies to utilize the capital and surplus of all of the companies  rather than each individual company 
under pooling arrangements  companies share in the insurance business that is underwritten and allocate the combined premium  losses and related expenses between the companies within the pooling arrangement 
the insurance company subsidiaries entered into an inter company reinsurance agreement the pooling agreement 
this pooling agreement includes star  ameritrust insurance corporation ameritrust  savers property and casualty insurance company savers and williamsburg national insurance company williamsburg 
pursuant to the pooling agreement  savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to cede to star and star has agreed to reinsure of the liabilities and expenses of savers  ameritrust and williamsburg  relating to all insurance and reinsurance policies issued by them 
in return  star agreed to cede and savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to reinsure star for their respective percentages of the liabilities and expenses of star 
annually  we examine the pooling agreement for any changes to the ceded percentage for the liabilities and expenses 
any changes to the pooling agreement must be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities for approval

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and a half and five and a half years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of  compared to at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio was million 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
we continued to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our return to profitability and our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are rounded and in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps market value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  in october  we entered into two interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on million and million of our senior debentures and trust preferred securities  respectively 
we accrue for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as a cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges under sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
any changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is being accrued and is being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit 
at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by
