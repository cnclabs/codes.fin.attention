overview our business we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that performs basic research and develops  manufactures  markets and sells branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry  we seek to develop  in license  acquire or obtain commercialization rights to novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in attractive markets 
our corporate strategy is focused on specialty driven markets  particularly neuroscience  hospital and acute care 
we believe each of our targeted markets has significant market potential and our organization is aligned accordingly 
we work to achieve organic growth by maximizing the potential of our currently marketed products through sales and marketing and product life cycle management 
we also work to achieve organic growth through the successful development of new branded pharmaceutical products 
additionally  we seek to achieve growth through the acquisition or in licensing of novel branded pharmaceutical products in various stages of development and technologies that have significant market potential that complement our neuroscience  hospital and acute care medicine platforms 
we may also seek company acquisitions which add products or products in development  technologies or sales and marketing capabilities in our target markets or that otherwise complement our operations 

table of contents utilizing our internal resources and a disciplined business development process  we strive to be a leader and partner of choice in developing and commercializing innovative  clinically differentiated therapies and technologies in our target  specialty driven markets 
our business consists of five segments which include branded pharmaceuticals  meridian auto injector  royalties  contract manufacturing  and other 
our branded pharmaceutical products are divided into the following categories neuroscience including skelaxin  avinza and sonata  hospital including thrombin jmi and synercid  acute care including bicillin and intal  and legacy products including altace  levoxyl and cytomel 
our meridian auto injector segment includes epipen  a commercial product  and nerve gas antidotes which we provide to the us military 
our royalties segment relates to revenues we derive from successfully developed products that we have licensed to third parties 
executive summary during  we took many steps to better position us for long term growth 
with the unexpected early entry of generic competition for altace  we accelerated the implementation of our planned strategic shift to focus on specialty driven markets where we have core capabilities and assets 
we also expanded our portfolio of marketed products and development pipeline and advanced projects in our development pipeline  with an emphasis in these markets 
accelerated strategic shift following the circuit court s decision in september invalidating our altace patent  we conducted an extensive examination of our company and developed a restructuring initiative designed to accelerate a previously planned strategic shift emphasizing our focus on specialty driven markets where we have core capabilities and assets  specifically the neuroscience  hospital and acute care markets 
this initiative included a reduction in personnel  staff leverage  expense reductions and additional controls over spending  reorganization of sales teams and a realignment of research and development priorities 
pursuant to this initiative  we terminated approximately of our workforce  primarily through a reduction in our sales force 
we have incurred total costs of approximately million associated with this initiative 
we estimate that the selling  general and administrative expense savings from these actions will range from million to million 
new generic competition in december  a third party launched a generic substitute for our altace capsules 
this followed the decision of the us circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit the circuit court in september which declared invalid us patent no 
 the patent that covered our altace product  overruling the decision of the us district court for the eastern district of virginia the district court  which had upheld the validity of the patent 
we filed with the circuit court a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc  but this petition was denied in december the circuit court issued the mandate to the district court on december   beginning the day hatch waxman exclusive marketing period for the first generic competitor that has entered the market 
following this day period of exclusivity  we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market 
we launched a tablet formulation of altace in february 
table of contents expanded product portfolio and development pipeline neuroscience on february   we acquired all the rights to avinza in the united states  its territories and canada from ligand pharmaceuticals incorporated ligand 
avinza is an extended release formulation of morphine and is indicated as a once daily treatment for moderate to severe pain in patients who require continuous opioid therapy for an extended period of time 
in october  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with acura pharmaceuticals  inc acura to develop and commercialize certain immediate release opioid analgesic products utilizing acura s proprietary aversion abuse deterrent abuse resistant technology in the united states  canada and mexico 
the agreement provides us with an exclusive license for acurox tm oxycodone hcl  niacin and a unique combination of other ingredients tablets  and another undisclosed immediate release opioid product utilizing acura s aversion technology 
in addition  the agreement provides us with an option to license all future opioid analgesic products developed utilizing acura s aversion technology 
acurox tm tablets are intended to effectively treat moderate to moderately severe pain while discouraging common methods of abuse  including intravenous injection or oral consumption of tablets dissolved in liquids  nasal inhalation of crushed tablets and intentional swallowing of excessive numbers of tablets 
the agreement with acura  which provides us with a wide range of immediate release opioids utilizing the aversion technology platform  complements our collaborative agreement with pain therapeutics  inc to develop and commercialize remoxy tm and other extended release  long acting opioid painkillers that are also designed to resist common methods of abuse 
hospital our product thrombin jmi is the market leading topical hemostat used to control bleeding during surgery 
to better meet the needs of our customers and in anticipation of the recent entry of two new competitors  we introduced new thrombin jmi based products in  broadening the range of delivery options 
in january  we obtained an exclusive license to the hemostatic products designed by vascular solutions  inc for use outside catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories 
this license includes products which we market as thrombi pad tm x hemostatic pad  the only composite of thrombin jmi and gauze pad  offering healthcare professionals in the emergency department a convenient option to achieve active hemostasis at bleeding sites where they would typically use trauma dressing  and thrombi gel thrombin gelatin foam hemostat which provides a convenient topical hemostat option 
the license also includes a product we expect to market as thrombi paste tm  which is currently in development 
each of these products includes thrombin jmi as a component 
in june  the us food and drug administration fda approved our thrombin jmi epistaxis kit  a new intranasal spray delivery device for thrombin jmi for use to aid in stopping epistaxes nosebleeds 
the kit offers healthcare professionals in the emergency department and trauma center a convenient new option to achieve fast  active hemostasis during epistaxes 
we began marketing the thrombin jmi epistaxis kit in the united states in the third quarter of beginning in  thrombin jmi  our bovine thrombin  has new competition from human thrombin and recombinant human thrombin 
omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc s biologics licensing application bla for its human thrombin product was approved in september zymogenetics  inc received approval of its bla for recombinant human thrombin in january the presence of competing products in the marketplace may reduce net sales of thrombin jmi materially 

table of contents our research and development projects our current research and development pipeline includes several products in phase iii and late phase ii clinical trials  including immediate release and long acting opioid products utilizing abuse deterrent abuse resistant platform technologies pursuant to our collaborations with pain therapeutics and acura 
remoxy tm and corvue tm have completed phase iii clinical trials 
remoxy tm  a novel formulation of extended release  long acting oxycodone for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  is designed to resist common methods of abuse  such as crushing  heating  or dissolution in alcohol  that are reported with respect to currently available formulations of long acting oxycodone 
in december  we  together with pain therapeutics  announced positive results from the pivotal phase iii clinical trial for remoxy tm 
this trial met its primary endpoint  pain relief versus placebo  as prospectively defined by the fda during the special protocal assessment process 
pain therapeutics plans to file a new drug application for remoxy tm with the fda in the second quarter of corvue tm binodenoson is a pharmacologic cardiac stress imaging agent intended to provide a reduced side effects profile compared to the currently approved product adenoscan 
we received positive results from our phase iii clinical trials for corvue tm and expect to file an nda by early our products in phase iii of development include acurox tm and vanquix tm 
acurox tm tablets are intended to effectively treat moderate to moderately severe acute pain while deterring or resisting common methods of prescription drug abuse  including intravenous injection or oral consumption of tablets dissolved in liquids  nasal inhalation of crushed tablets and intentional swallowing of excessive numbers of tablets 
in early  acurox tm tablets successfully completed a special protocol assessment with the fda 
as a result  the pivotal phase iii clinical trial with acurox tm tablets in patients with moderate to severe pain commenced in september and we expect to report results in the second half of vanquix tm is our diazepam filled auto injector that is currently under development as the only therapy of its kind for the treatment of acute  repetitive epileptic seizures 
our phase ii compounds include sonedenoson  formerly mre  an adenosine aa receptor agonist for the topical treatment of chronic  neuropathic  diabetic foot ulcers  and t  an adenosine a allosteric enhancer that we are developing for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
the phase ii clinical trial for sonedenoson did not meet its primary endpoint 
we are continuing to evaluate the data from this trial 
we expect enrollment of patients in the phase ii clinical trial for t to begin in the middle of rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility in october  we sold our rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility  some of our legacy products that are manufactured there and the related contract manufacturing business to jhp pharmaceuticals  llc jhp for million  less selling costs of million 
this transaction resulted in a loss of million 
the companies also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which jhp will provide to us certain filling and finishing manufacturing activities with respect to thrombin jmi 
the sale did not include our stand alone sterile penicillin production facility that is also located in rochester  michigan

for the years ended december  in thousands total revenues branded pharmaceuticals meridian auto injector royalties contract manufacturing other total revenues cost of revenues  exclusive of depreciation  amortization and impairments branded pharmaceuticals meridian auto injector royalties contract manufacturing other total cost of revenues the following table summarizes our deductions from gross sales 
for the years ended december  in thousands gross sales commercial rebates medicare part d rebates medicaid rebates chargebacks returns trade discounts other discontinued operations net sales gross sales were higher in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of avinza on february   price increases taken during and an increase in gross sales of our meridian auto injector segment 
these increases in gross sales were partially offset by a decline in prescriptions of certain of our branded pharmaceutical products during gross sales were higher in compared to primarily due to price increases  higher unit sales as a result of the effect of wholesale inventory reductions of some of our branded pharmaceutical products during  particularly altace  and an increase in gross sales of our meridian auto injector segment 
these increases in gross sales were partially offset by a decline in prescriptions of certain of our branded pharmaceutical products during 
table of contents medicaid rebate expense was lower in than in primarily due to the federal government shifting persons who were covered by the medicaid program to the medicare part d program 
during january  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act became effective  which provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens and certain disabled citizens in the united states 
we have contracts with organizations that administer the medicare part d program  which require us to pay rebates based on contractual pricing and actual utilization under the plans 
initial enrollment in the medicare part d program was open through the middle of the second quarter of as part of our ongoing efforts to facilitate improved management of wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products  we have entered into inventory management and data services agreements with each of our three key wholesale customers and other wholesale customers 
these agreements provide wholesalers incentives to manage inventory levels and provide timely and accurate data with respect to inventory levels held  and valuable data regarding sales and marketplace activity 
we rely on the timeliness and accuracy of the data that each customer provides to us on a regular basis pursuant to these agreements 
if our wholesalers fail to provide us with timely and accurate data in accordance with the agreements  our estimates for certain reserves included in our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
based on inventory data provided by our key customers under the imas  we believe that wholesale inventory levels of altace  skelaxin  thrombin jmi  avinza and sonata  as of december   are at or below normalized levels 
we estimate that the wholesale and retail inventories of our products as of december  represent gross sales of approximately million to million 
the following tables provide the activity and ending balances for our significant deductions from gross sales 
accrual for rebates  including administrative fees in thousands balance at january  net of prepaid amounts current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods rebates paid balance at december  net of prepaid amounts rebates include commercial rebates and medicaid and medicare rebates 
during the third quarter of  we began reporting to the centers for medicare and medicaid services using a refined calculation to compute our average manufacturer s price amp and best price 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we recalculated rebates due with respect to prior quarters utilizing the refined amp and best price calculations 
as a result of this updated information  during the third quarter of  we decreased our reserve for estimated medicaid and other government pricing program obligations and increased net sales from branded pharmaceutical products by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to this does not include the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
as a result of the increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace increased by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to the effect of this change in estimate on operating income was  therefore  approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to during the first quarter of  we paid approximately million related to i the settlement agreements with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs oig and the department of veterans affairs  to resolve the governmental investigations related to our underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to and ii similar state settlement agreements 
for a discussion regarding this settlement  please see settlement of governmental pricing investigation included in note  commitments 
table of contents and contingencies  in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
of the million paid in the first quarter of  approximately million reduced the rebate accrual and is reflected in rebates paid in the table above 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we delayed our regular periodic medicaid rebate payments as a result of prior overpayments 
during the second quarter of  we began reducing our payments for medicaid rebates to utilize overpayments made to the government related to medicaid during the government pricing investigation in  and during the period of the investigation  we made actual medicaid payments in excess of estimated expense to avoid any underpayments to the government 
as a result of refining the amp and best price calculations in the third quarter of  we discontinued the practice of making payments in excess of the amounts expensed 
we expect to recover the remaining overpayments to the government and will continue to reduce cash payments in the future until this overpayment is fully recovered 
for a discussion regarding this investigation  please see note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
in and  the utilization of overpayments reduced our rebate payments by approximately million and million  respectively 
the utilization of the overpayment has therefore reduced rebates paid in the table above 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our medicaid rebate expense and increased net sales from branded pharmaceutical products by approximately million due to the determination that a liability established in for a government pricing program for military dependents and retirees was no longer probable 
accrual for returns in thousands balance at january current provision actual returns ending balance at december our calculation for returns reserves is based on historical sales and return rates over the period during which customers have a right of return 
we also consider current wholesale and retail inventory levels of our products 
based on data received from our inventory management agreements with our three key wholesale customers  there was a significant reduction of wholesale inventory levels of our products during the first quarter of this reduction resulted in a change in estimate during the first quarter of that decreased the reserve for returns by approximately million and increased net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
during the second quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment for sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount as a result of an additional reduction in wholesale inventory levels of our branded products 
these adjustments are reflected in the table above as a reduction in the current provision 
during the third quarter of  our actual returns of branded pharmaceutical products continued to decrease significantly compared to actual returns during the quarterly periods in and the first quarter of additionally  based on data received pursuant to our inventory management agreements with key wholesale customers  we continued to experience normalized wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products during the third quarter of accordingly  we believed that the rate of returns experienced during the second and third quarters of was more indicative of what we expected in future quarters and adjusted our returns reserve accordingly 
this change in estimate resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the returns reserve in the third quarter of and a corresponding increase in net sales from branded pharmaceutical products 
as a result of this increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace increased by approximately million 
the effect of the change in estimate on operating income was  therefore  approximately million 

table of contents because actual returns related to sales in prior periods were lower than our original estimates  we recorded a decrease in our reserve for returns in each of the first quarter of and the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
the effect of the change in estimate on first quarter operating income was an increase of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount

special items are those particular material income or expense items that our management believes are not related to our ongoing  underlying business  are not recurring  or are not generally predictable 
these items include  but are not limited to  merger and restructuring expenses  non capitalized expenses associated with acquisitions  such as in process research and development charges and inventory valuation adjustment charges  charges resulting from the early extinguishments of debt  asset impairment charges  expenses of drug recalls  and gains and losses resulting from the divestiture of assets 
we believe the identification of special items enhances an analysis of our ongoing  underlying business and an analysis of our financial results when comparing those results to that of a previous or subsequent like period

revenues from the meridian auto injector segment fluctuate based on the buying patterns of dey  lp and government customers 
demand for epipen is seasonal as a result of its use in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions to insect stings or bites  more of which occur in the warmer months 
with respect to auto injector products sold to government entities  demand for these products is affected by the cyclical nature of procurements as well as response to domestic and international events

these expenses have continued to increase over time as our development programs have progressed to later stages of clinical development  which later stages are much more expensive than earlier stages  and as we have continued to add late stage products in development to our portfolio 
our business model continues to focus on adding to our research and development pipeline through the acquisition of novel branded pharmaceutical products and technologies in later stages of development 
research and development in process upon acquisition represents the actual cost of acquiring rights to novel branded pharmaceutical projects in development from third parties  which costs we expense at the time of acquisition 
we classify these costs as special items  and in   and special items included the following a charge equaling million during associated with our collaborative agreement with acura pharmaceuticals  inc acura to develop and commercialize certain immediate release opioid analgesic products utilizing acura s proprietary aversion abuse deterrent abuse resistant technology in the united states  canada and mexico 
the agreement provides us with an exclusive license for acurox tm oxycodone hcl  niacin and a unique combination of other ingredients tablets and another undisclosed immediate release opioid product utilizing acura s aversion technology 
in addition  the agreement provides us with an option to license all future opioid analgesic products developed utilizing acura s aversion technology 
acurox tm tablets are intended to effectively treat moderate to moderately severe acute pain while resisting or deterring common methods of abuse  including intravenous injection or oral consumption of tablets dissolved in liquids  nasal inhalation of crushed tablets and intentional swallowing of excessive numbers of tablets 
in connection with the agreement with acura  we recognized the above payments of million as in process research and development expense during this amount was expensed as the in process research and development project had not received regulatory approval and had no alternative future use 
the in process research and development project is part of the branded pharmaceutical segment 
acurox tm is currently in phase iii of clinical development 
we believe there is a reasonable probability 
table of contents of completing the project successfully 
however  the success of the project depends on the outcome of the phase iii clinical trial program and approval by the fda 
the estimated cost to complete the project at the execution of the agreement was approximately million 
if the phase iii clinical trials are successful  we would expect to obtain fda approval in or a charge equaling million during for a payment to mutual pharmaceutical company mutual to jointly research and develop one or more improved formulations of metaxalone 
under the agreement with mutual  we sought mutual s expertise in developing improved formulations of metaxalone  including improved formulations mutual developed prior to execution of this agreement and access to mutual s and united research laboratories rights in intellectual property pertaining to these formulations 
development activities under this agreement ceased in december a charge equaling million during for our acquisition of in process research and development associated with our collaboration with arrow to commercialize one or more novel formulations of ramipril  the active ingredient in our altace product 
under a series of agreements  arrow has granted us rights to certain current and future ndas regarding novel formulations of ramipril and intellectual property  including patent rights and technology licenses relating to these novel formulations 
arrow will have responsibility for the manufacture and supply of new formulations of ramipril for us 
however  under certain conditions  we may manufacture and supply the formulations of ramipril instead of arrow 
arrow will earn fees for the manufacture and supply of the new formulations of ramipril 
arrow filed an nda for a tablet formulation of ramipril in january the ramipril application 
at the time of our acquisition of this project  its success was dependent on additional development activities and fda approval 
the estimated cost to complete the project at the execution of these agreements was approximately million 
the fda approved the nda on february  arrow granted us an exclusive option to acquire their entire right  title and interest to the ramipril application or any future filed amended ramipril application for the amount of million

remoxy tm is an investigational drug in late stage clinical development by pain therapeutics for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain 
we are responsible for all research and development expenses related to this alliance 
the value of the in process research and development project was expensed on the date of acquisition as it had not received regulatory approval and had no alternative future use 
remoxy tm has successfully completed phase iii of clinical development and pain therapeutics expects to file the nda in the second quarter of we currently anticipate obtaining fda approval in we believe there is a reasonable probability of completing the project successfully 
however  the success of the project depends on regulatory approval and our ability to successfully manufacture the product 
a charge of million during for our acquisition of in process research and development due to our co exclusive license agreement with mutual pharmaceutical company whereby we obtained a license to certain intellectual property relating to metaxalone 
the intellectual property licensed to us relates to the potential for improved dosing and administration of metaxalone 
the value of the in process research and development project was expensed on the date of acquisition as it had not received regulatory approval and had no alternative future use 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to primarily due to increased amortization expense related to avinza and altace partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense associated with the sale of the rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility 
on february   we completed our acquisition of avinza and began amortizing the associated intangible assets as of that date 
during  following the circuit court s decision invalidating our altace patent as 
table of contents discussed above  we decreased the estimated useful life of our altace intangible assets 
on june   the assets associated with the sale of the rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility were classified as held for sale  and accordingly the depreciation and amortization was discontinued as of that date

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in for additional information relating to amortization expense please see note  intangible assets and goodwill  in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
other operating expenses in addition to the special items described above  we incurred other special items affecting operating costs and expenses resulting in a net charge totaling million in compared to a net charge totaling million during and million during these other special items included the following an intangible asset impairment charge of million in related to our altace product as a result of the invalidation of the patent which covered the altace product 
following the circuit court s decision  we reduced the estimated useful life of this product and forecasted net sales 
this decrease in estimated remaining useful life and forecasted net sales reduced the probability weighted estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with altace intangible assets to a level below their carrying value 
we determined the fair value of these assets based on probability weighted estimated discounted future cash flows 
a charge of million in related to the write down of our rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility and certain legacy branded pharmaceutical products which we classified as held for sale 
on october   we closed the asset purchase agreement with jhp  pursuant to which jhp acquired our rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility  some of our legacy products that are manufactured there and the related contract manufacturing business 
for additional information  please see note  intangible assets and goodwill  in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
intangible asset impairment charges of million in primarily related to our decision to no longer pursue the development of a new formulation of intal utilizing hydroflouroalkane as a propellant 
an intangible asset impairment charge in of million  which is primarily related to lower than expected prescription growth for intal and tilade 
an intangible asset impairment charge in of million  which primarily related to a greater than expected decline in prescriptions for sonata and an anticipated decline in prescriptions for corzide 
these charges were recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the intangible assets on our balance sheet associated with these products so as to reflect the estimated fair value of these assets at the time the charges were incurred 
restructuring charges in the amount of million in primarily due to our restructuring initiative designed to accelerate a planned strategic shift emphasizing our focus in neuroscience  hospital and acute care medicine and separation payments associated with the sale of the rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility discussed above 
restructuring charges of million and million during and  respectively for separation payments that primarily arose in 
table of contents connection with our decision to transfer the production of levoxyl from our st 
petersburg  florida facility to the bristol  tennessee facility 
restructuring charges of million in and million in due to a decision to reduce our workforce in order to improve efficiencies in our operations 
restructuring charges of million in primarily as a result of separation agreements with several of our executives  the relocation of our sales and marketing operations from bristol  tennessee to new jersey and our decision to discontinue some relatively insignificant products associated with our meridian auto injector business 
income of million in primarily due to a gain on the termination of our co promotion and license agreements with novavax  inc regarding estrasorb tm and the repurchase by novavax of all of its convertible notes which we held 
as of december   the net intangible assets associated with synercid totaled approximately million 
we believe that these intangible assets are not currently impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
however  if our estimates regarding future cash flows prove to be incorrect or adversely change  we may have to reduce the estimated remaining useful life and or write off a portion or all of these intangible assets 
in addition  certain generic companies have challenged patents on skelaxin and avinza 
for additional information  please see note  commitments and contingencies in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
if a generic version of skelaxin or avinza enters the market  we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with these products 
the net book value of some of our manufacturing facilities currently exceeds fair market value 
management currently believes that the long term assets associated with these facilities are not impaired based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  if we were to approve a plan to sell or close any of the facilities for which the carrying value exceeds fair market value  we would have to write off a portion of the assets or reduce the estimated useful life of the assets which would accelerate depreciation 
non operating items for the years ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense loss on investment gain on early extinguishment of debt other  net income tax expense discontinued operations other income expense interest income increased during compared to and in compared to primarily due to an increase in interest rates and a higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities in compared to and in compared to we believe interest income will decrease in compared to due to a diversification of our investments in for additional information related to the diversification of our investments in please see liquidity and capital resources below

during the third quarter of  we sold our investment in novavax 
income tax expense during our effective income tax rate on our income from continuing operations was 
this rate differed from the statutory rate of primarily due to tax benefits relating to tax exempt interest income and domestic production activities deductions  which benefits were partially offset by state taxes 
additionally  the rate benefited from the release of reserves under fin as a result of the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the and tax years 
we believe our effective tax rate in will be higher than the effective tax rate

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  except for operating leases in the normal course of business as described in note lease obligations in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report and as reflected in the table below 
the following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than one to four to more than total one year three years five years five years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations interest on long term debt total our unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to minimum purchase requirements under contracts with suppliers to purchase raw materials and finished goods related to our branded pharmaceutical products and commitments associated with research and development projects 
the above table does not reflect any potential milestone payments in connection with research and development projects or acquisitions 
we have a supply agreement with a third party to produce ramipril  the active ingredient in altace 
this supply agreement is reflected in the unconditional purchase obligations above 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum levels of ramipril as long as we maintain market exclusivity on altace in the united states  and thereafter the parties must negotiate in good faith the annual minimum purchase quantities 
in september  our patent that covered our altace product was invalidated by the circuit court as discussed above 
as a result of the invalidation of the patent  we concluded that we have more altace 
table of contents raw material than is required to meet anticipated future demand for the product 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in for our estimated remaining minimum purchase requirements for excess altace raw material associated with this supply agreement 
if prescriptions for  or sales of  altace are less than current expectations  we may incur additional losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreement 
in the event we incur additional losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreement  there may be a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
we have supply agreements with two third parties to produce metaxalone  the active ingredient in skelaxin 
these supply agreements require us to purchase certain minimum levels of metaxalone and expire in and if sales of skelaxin are not consistent with current forecasts  we could incur losses in connection with purchase commitments for metaxalone  which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond can not be made 
liquidity and capital resources general we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt securities and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  our existing revolving credit facility and funds potentially available to us under our universal shelf registration are sufficient to finance our current operations and working capital requirements on both a short term and long term basis 
however  we cannot predict the amount or timing of our need for additional funds under various circumstances  which could include a significant acquisition of a business or assets  new product development projects  expansion opportunities  or other factors that may require us to raise additional funds in the future 
we cannot provide assurance that funds will be available to us when needed on favorable terms  or at all 
as of december   our investments in debt securities of  million consisted solely of tax exempt auction rate securities  and we were not invested in any mortgage backed securities or any securities backed by corporate debt obligations 
the tax exempt auction rate securities that we hold are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through an auction process generally every seven  or days 
all of our investments in debt securities as of december   have experienced at least one successful auction since that time 
our investment policy requires us to maintain an investment portfolio with a high credit quality 
accordingly  our investments in debt securities are limited to issues which are rated aa or higher at the time of purchase 
we have realized no loss of principal with respect to these investments 
during the first quarter of we diversified our portfolio of short term investments 
as of february   we had approximately million invested in tax exempt auction rate securities and million in money market funds supported by us treasury obligations 
as of february   our investments in tax exempt auction rate securities consisted of million associated with student loans backed by the federal family education loan program ffelp  million associated with municipal bonds in which performance is supported by bond insurers and million associated with student loans collateralized by loan pools which equal at least of the bond issue 
in the event that we attempt to liquidate a portion of our holdings through an auction and are unable to do so  we term it an auction failure 
on february   we began to experience auction failures 
since that date and as of february   of the auctions through which we have attempted to liquidate investments in tax exempt auction rate securities totaling million have failed 
in the event of an auction failure  the interest rate on the security is reset according to the contractual terms in the underlying indenture 
as of february   we have received all scheduled interest payments associated with these securities 

table of contents the current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
at this point in time  we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and any unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated financial statements 
on april   we established a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in april on april   this facility was terminated and replaced with a new million five year senior secured revolving credit facility which matures in april in october  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with acura to develop and commercialize certain opioid analgesic products utilizing acura s proprietary aversion abuse deterrent abuse resistant technology in the united states  canada and mexico

table of contents in april  we established a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in april on april   this facility was terminated and replaced with a new million five year senior secured revolving credit facility which is scheduled to mature in april the credit facility 
as of december   up to million is available to us under the credit facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by a pledge of of the equity of most of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of of the equity of our foreign subsidiaries

during november  we completed the sale of  newly issued shares of common stock for per share per share net of commissions and expenses resulting in net proceeds of million 
as of december   there was million of securities remaining registered for future offers and sales under the shelf registration statement 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while we have passed some price increases along to our customers  we have primarily benefited from sales growth negating most inflationary pressures 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a 
table of contents reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy and accounting for the amended and restated co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation consultants 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
however  patents have specific legal lives over which they are amortized 
conversely  trademarks and product rights have no specific legal lives 
trademarks and product rights will continue to be an asset to us after the expiration of the patent  as their economic value is not tied exclusively to the patent 
we believe that by establishing separate lives for the patent versus the trademark and product rights  we are in essence using an accelerated method of amortization for the product as a whole 
this results in greater amortization in earlier years when the product is under patent protection  as we are amortizing both the patent and the trademark and product rights  and less amortization when the product faces potential generic competition  as the amortization on the patent is eliminated 
because we have no discernible evidence to show a decline in cash flows for trademarks and product rights  or for patents  we use the straight line method of amortization for both intangibles 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
further  on an annual basis  we review the life of each intangible asset and make adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture or supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  new legislation or regulatory proposals

our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate our entire inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we make a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities that we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
accruals for rebates  returns and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks  medicaid  medicare and commercial rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback 
table of contents payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily on historical sales and return rates 
we also consider the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel 
we base our estimate of our medicaid rebate  medicare rebate and commercial rebate accruals on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our commercial and regulatory rebate obligations 
we base our estimate of our chargeback accrual on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
the estimate of the level of our products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our three key wholesalers under inventory management agreements 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyze these products for potential additional supplemental reserves 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties
