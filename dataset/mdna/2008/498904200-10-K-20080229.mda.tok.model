item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides an account of our financial performance and financial condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
overview the fourth quarter of completed a very successful year for knoll 
in  we experienced sales climbing past the billion mark and we were able to deliver more than growth in earnings per share 
this year we also continued to expand our industry leading margins and generated better than industry top line growth 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased our dividend from per share to per share 
net sales for the year were billion  an increase of over operating income and net income were million and million  an increase of and  respectively  over the full year diluted earnings per share rose from in to in  an increase of 
during  our gross margins expanded basis points from in to in the increase in gross margin was attributable to additional volume  better pricing  and moderating raw material and transportation inflation 
improved factory performance and our global sourcing initiatives also contributed to the increase 
in addition  we were able to achieve this gross margin increase despite the negative foreign exchange from the appreciation of the canadian dollar 
in  we continued to work to increase our share in non systems categories 
over the past several years we have actively expanded our product lines in these categories to help us pursue a larger share of the market for these goods 
we have successfully been selling to our office systems clients and securing stand alone opportunities for the sales of seating  files and storage  and casegoods 
our specialty businesses continue to offer a wide range of products and accessories for our customers 
in  we introduced the award winning and commercially successful life chair to drive our growth in the seating category and compete in the high performance work chair market 
in  we introduced the knoll essentials collection of easy to order  best selling products from our broad range of office furnishings and quadrupled our storage offering 
during  we increased the pace of our new product introductions for our knoll textiles collection of upholstery  panel fabrics  wall coverings and drapery and continued to expand our retail distribution network for our knollstudio collection of chairs  barstools  lounge seating  conference  dining and occasional tables to take advantage of increased consumer interest in modern and mid century design  showcase our design strength and broaden recognition of the knoll brand 
we introduced our chadwick chair in and introduced our essentials chair collection in january in october  we acquired teddy arthur edelman  limited as a compliment to our specialty businesses 
edelman leather supplies fine leathers to residential  hospitality  aviation and contract office furniture markets 
with the expansion of our product offerings either through product development or strategic acquisitions we have successfully been reducing our reliance on sales from office systems alone 
geographically we are also continuing to pursue opportunities for expansion outside of north american in europe and beyond 
we see these areas as having the greatest potential for growth in this year we amended our credit facility in order to give us more financial flexibility to pursue opportunities of share buybacks  strategic acquisitions  or increased dividends 
the refinancing of this new million revolving credit facility was completed on june  during the year we were able to acquire teddy arthur edelman  limited  buy back million shares  and increase our dividend to in the fourth quarter of we accomplished all of this while simultaneously decreasing our leverage ratio during since the end of  our debt has only increased by million 
annual cash generated from operations in was million  compared to million the year before 
capital expenditures in totaled million compared to million for investing 
table of contents activities also included million for the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited 
in addition  we spent million on stock repurchases during the year and paid million in dividends to our stockholders 
overall  our strong performance in enhanced our ability to invest in initiatives that drive top line growth and improve our margins 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademarks and deferred financing fees 
goodwill is recorded at the amount by which cost exceeds the net assets of acquired businesses  and all other intangible assets are recorded at cost 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually rather than being amortized 
on december   we purchased certain intangibles as an investment in our seating line 
a definite useful life was assigned to these intangibles and  as such  amortization will be recorded over the economic life of the intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards goodwill and other intangible assets 
on october   in combination with the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited  we acquired certain intangible assets related to a trade name  non compete agreement and customer relationships 
the trade name was valued at million and it will be tested annually for impairment 
the non compete agreement and customer relationships intangibles were valued at million and million  respectively 
these were assigned definite useful lives and  as such  amortization will be recorded over the economic life of the intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents deferred financing costs that are incurred by us in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
the period of these costs maybe shortened if the underlying indebtedness is modified or retired 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of our us employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan s asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gain and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb no 
   and r sfas 
key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate we use to determine the obligation for these benefits matches the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry 
table of contents trends and advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was in determining the benefit obligation for and in determining the net periodic benefit cost for the rate was then assumed to decrease per year to an ultimate rate of for and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december   by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  we recognized in our statement of financial position the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the above valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas  on january  fin created a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements

our old interest rate cap agreement  which also matured on september   and our two new interest rate cap agreements entered into on september   are classified as risk management instruments and management has elected to not apply hedge accounting 
as such  the change in fair value of the contracts is reported in earnings in the period the value of the contract changes as a component of other income expense 
changes in valuation assumptions and estimates used by the counterparties could materially affect our results of operations or financial position

liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock net proceeds from repayment of debt payment of dividends net proceeds from issuance of stock net cash used for financing activities historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares and scheduled payments of principal and interest under our debt 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
during the first half  we implemented our million discretionary stock repurchase program and began using cash generated by operating activities to buy back shares 
on february   our board of 
table of contents directors approved a million increase to this discretionary stock repurchase program 
as of february   we had authority under this discretionary stock repurchase program to spend approximately million 
we use our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs  and at times make significant borrowings and repayments under the revolving facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in operating cash flow in was largely a result of an increase of million in net income 
non cash amortizations accounted for million of the increase as well as million from the non cash write off of deferred financing fees 
these increases were partially offset with increased spending to fund our working capital as a result of higher sales volumes 
the increase in operating cash flow in was largely a result of an increase of million in net income 
this increase was offset with increased spending to fund our working capital needs as a result of higher sales volumes 
in addition  with the implementation of fas r  the tax benefit from stock options is now included in financing activities as a cash inflow rather than in operating activities as it was in for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and million of net borrowings  to fund million in capital expenditures  repurchase million of common stock for treasury  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
in addition  on october   we completed the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited 
cash expenditures for the transaction totaled million  net of cash acquired 
cash from financing activities in also included the payment of fees on the refinanced credit facility 
in  we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and million of net borrowings  to fund million in capital expenditures  purchase million of intangibles  repurchase million of common stock for treasury  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and fund working capital 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility with a new million revolving credit facility 
the new agreement matures in june and may be used for general corporate purposes  including strategic acquisitions  stock buybacks and cash dividends 
under the new agreement  we can also increase our facility by up to million subject to certain limitations and satisfaction of certain conditions 
the improved interest rates in the new facility will provide for reduced borrowing costs allowing us to free up cash for other uses 
at december   our outstanding debt was million 
our credit facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of which million of letters of credit was outstanding at december  in addition to the above described credit facility  our foreign subsidiaries maintain local credit facilities to provide credit for overdraft  working capital and other purposes 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will have adequate funds available to meet long term cash requirements and that we will be able to comply with the covenants under the credit agreement 
future principal debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control

environmental matters our past and present business operations and our past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of beginning in late  we began a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations  which require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in this regard  management has dedicated internal resources  engaged outside consultants and adopted and implemented a detailed work plan to i assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial 
table of contents reporting  ii take steps to improve control processes  where appropriate  iii validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and iv implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting 
our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting have resulted  and are likely to continue to result  in increased expenses 
management and our audit committee have given our compliance with section the highest priority 
we cannot  however  be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we fail to correct any issues in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations and related interest rate hedge agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non us operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers 
we also have risk in our exposure to certain material and transportation costs 
our largest raw material costs are for steel and plastics 
steel is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our products 
the price of plastic  another significant raw material used in the manufacture of our products  is sensitive to the cost of oil  which has increased significantly in recent history 
for the year ended december   material inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was approximately million 
during  material inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was approximately million 
we continue working to attempt to offset these price changes in raw materials and transportation through our global sourcing initiatives  cost improvements and price increases to our products 
interest rate risk we have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates impacts the interest incurred and cash paid on the variable rate 
the weighted average rate for was 
the weighted average rate for the same period of was 
we use interest rate hedge agreements for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt
