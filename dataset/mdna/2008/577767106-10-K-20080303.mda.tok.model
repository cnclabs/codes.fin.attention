table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table presents selected consolidated financial information in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  revenue revenue percentage increase gross profit as a percentage of revenue sg a as percentage of revenue r d expense as percentage of revenue loss from continuing operations net loss basic and diluted net loss per share revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the prior year 
the majority of the revenue increase came from the high voltage capacitors hv product line  which generated a increase in sales from this increase was due to two factors of the increase was from increased sales of hv products  while the exchange rate from swiss franc to us dollars represented of the hv revenue increase 
we anticipate revenue for hv products will continue to increase 
however  we are facing challenges in sourcing certain raw materials necessary for production 
we continue to explore various sourcing options for these raw materials 
we are also adding production capacity in our rossens plant in order to meet customer demand 
license revenue totaled  in  down from million in the reduction is due to the completion of the license agreement through which we provided ultracapacitor cell designs and manufacturing know how to shanghai urban eclectic power investment development corporation 
we are now fulfilling the sourcing agreement through which we supply ultracapacitor electrode material to this customer 
although historically license revenue has been sporadic  management believes that there are significant additional opportunities to generate revenue from our technology and know how 
the company will continue to explore various opportunities in  some of which include the licensing of our intellectual property unrelated to electrode fabrication  to battery companies for improvements in production processes and battery performance 
microelectronics me revenue increased  or from the prior year 
the increase was due to a million increase in sales volume of me components  mostly for our new single board computers  which was offset by a million decrease in sales for the npoess project 
revenue for the npoess project decreased due to funding limitations of the program 
we expect me revenue to increase in as additional npoess funding becomes available and as demand for our single board computer products continue to grow 
however  accounting revenue recognition rules require deferring all revenue for shipments of single board computer products until the final flight rated boards have been shipped and acceptance from the customer is received 
these revenue recognition rules will continue to make me revenue fluctuate from period to period 
boostcap product revenue decreased by million  or from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower than forecasted sales during the first half of the year to our largest customer  a wind turbine oem  and lower sales than in the prior year to a power systems integrator for incorporation into a telecommunications power quality application in europe 
sales to our wind turbine oem customer increased to the anticipated quarterly run rate in the second half of  and are expected to continue at or above the 
table of contents end of year rate  which would result in higher sales in than in we also expect additional sales in for the telecommunication application described above 
in addition  increased design in activity for bus  truck and electric rail applications is expected to contribute to higher boostcap revenue in however  in the past we have also experienced various delays from major customer s internal production problems or their shortages of other key materials for their products unrelated to ultracapacitors 
these and other issues are out of our control and could have a significant impact on revenue 
we continue to work with customers who are finding various applications for our boostcap products in a multitude of devices and systems 
in most cases  our customers carry out their assessment of our products in house 
however  in some situations  the customer contracts with maxwell to provide that service for a fee 
in  we recognized million in non recurring engineering fees 
although r d endeavors may be specific to a particular customer application  they provide us with additional information that we can use for the utilization  construction  design and specifications of other boostcap products along with the additional revenue we receive 
in we expect to realize the benefits of the past year s changes that include the outsourcing of ultracapacitor manufacturing which will provide significant cost reductions for those products 
management has also reviewed the entire line of boostcap products and has decided to discontinue production of certain low volume items and to increase prices of others to bring them more in line with the costs associated with a lower volume part 
we also reviewed our standard price list and  considering the value our products provide to our customers  we are increasing pricing to better balance the volume revenue equation 
gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
the gross profit within the boostcap product line increased primarily as a result of the increased off shore manufacturing of those products 
the cost reduction benefit of moving finished good manufacturing off shore began to be realized in however  the impact of those costs savings were not fully reflected in financial results until the end of as the off shore inventory took the place of the higher cost inventory 
as such  has been a process of implementing these efficiencies with the expectation that results will reflect benefits to our gross profit from cost reductions and other value based pricing strategy 
for the purpose of comparison to the previous year  in we had lower license revenue  while non reoccurring engineering revenue increased  which also added to the gross profit 
our overall gross profit for was higher than  the improvement is due to increased volume and a change in the mix of products sold 
the gross profit percentage increased slightly for boostcap and microelectronics products while high voltage gross profit margin percentage declined slightly in  ending the year near an historical average 
in  we expect to see continued improvement in gross profit percentage for boostcap products as expected increased product production will be spread over a relatively consistent overhead costs 
while our two other products we anticipate to be more inline with historical averages 
for the year ended december  costs of sales also included  of stock compensation expense versus  in selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for compared with million for the increase is predominantly related to increased labor costs of million  million of which was from our increased sales and marketing staff and  was an increase in general and administrative which stems from expanded management capabilities 
our sales cost increased  in due to new costs associated with the establishment of a representation office in china 
stock compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards  although they have no effect on cash  increased  in to million 
additionally  
table of contents expenses for outside sales commissions increased  and the general and administrative expenses for travel increased  and consulting and other professional services increased  in compared with research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for increased r d spending was a result of new product development efforts for boostcap and microelectronics product lines as well as higher spending on intellectual property activity for patent filings 
boostcap development efforts included focusing on the continued improvement of the energy density of our ultracapacitor products 
the goal is to evaluate and understand each fundamental component of the ultracapacitor and maximize its performance 
we are involved with r d partnerships to provide or assist in specific research for the application  utilization  construction  design  and specifications of our boostcap products 
in the situations where we are conducting involved research our clients pay for all or the majority of costs 
microelectronics development efforts have focused primarily on single board computer development 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded tax provisions during and of  and  respectively 
the provisions recorded relate to our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary has a tax holiday  which was extended in for an additional five years 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit for our net loss from fiscal due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
however  we have a recorded a deferred tax asset  of approximately  and a deferred tax liability of similar amount  for the embedded conversion rights of our convertible debentures 
these amounts are netted in the balance sheet 
additionally  we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  compared to  total revenue increased million  or  from the prior year 
three quarters of the revenue increase came from the boostcap product line  which experienced increased demand for its products as well as license revenue that totaled million in approximately of the revenue increase came from the high voltage product line 
management expects high voltage revenue to continue to increase in  but at a lower rate than what was experienced in microelectronics revenue in was marginally lower than in maxwell expects microelectronics revenue to grow in driven by the npoess single board computer contract and demand for component products 
gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
the gross profit within the boostcap product line decreased because of increased production costs associated with our ramp up and phase in of increased manufacturing capacity 
the challenge continues to be the ability to ramp up production and keep pace with demand while simultaneously achieving anticipated production efficiencies 
once these efficiencies are fully in place we anticipate achieving the required cost reductions to meet our pricing strategy 
we expect to continue driving down production costs to meet the pricing requirements of the markets in which we compete 
although our overall gross profit for was lower  there was an improvement in the gross profit of our high voltage products compared with high voltage gross profit improvements were primarily a result of 
table of contents reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume 
additionally  gross profit for microelectronics products improved compared with primarily as a result of increased single board computer demand from npoess 
for the year ended december  costs of sales also included  of stock compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r versus the comparable period where there was no expense for stock compensation 
selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for compared with million for the increase is predominantly related to stock compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards of million recognized in related to our adoption of sfas r  compared with  for the same period in additionally  sales expense  including labor and labor related expenses  outside commissions and advertising  increased to support significantly increased boostcap revenue 
research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for increased r d spending was a result of new product development efforts for boostcap and microelectronics product lines as well as higher spending on intellectual property activity for patent filings 
boostcap development efforts included electrode  ultracapacitor  and module designs while microelectronics development efforts focused on single board computer development 
we introduced several new boostcap products in and we anticipate continuing our investment in r d at levels similar to provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a  tax provision during compared with a  tax provision during the provisions recorded relate to our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary has a tax holiday  which was extended in for an additional five years 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit for our net loss from fiscal due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
however  we have a recorded a deferred tax asset  of approximately million  and a deferred tax liability of similar amount  for the embedded conversion rights of our convertible debentures 
these amounts are netted in the balance sheet 
additionally  we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets other than those related to convertible debentures 
discontinued operations we were named as a defendant in a suit filed on march  in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san luis obispo 
this suit  edmonds vs 
i bus phoenix  inc  was filed by the plaintiff on his behalf and alleges damages concerning the repurchase of i bus phoenix  inc shares 
on september  a california jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of  the company paid  including interest 
the expense is included in discontinued operations 
during fiscal  preferred shareholders of purepulse provided the company with a release of liability 
accordingly  a reserve of approximately  was reversed and is included in discontinued operations 
other events we assess the company s goodwill and intangible assets annually or as economic conditions warrant an assessment and determined that there was no impairment 
accordingly  no goodwill impairments were recognized for the years ended december   and 
table of contents amortization of intangibles was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from prior years of  relates to the amortization of the capitalized legal costs from the patent infringement lawsuit against nesscap as discussed above in item the remainder relates to the amortization of developed core technology acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena components and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell after the purchase of all shares not already owned by the company 
net interest expense for the years ended december  and were million and  respectively and net interest income of  for the year ended december  the transition from interest income to expense is due to the interest payments on the convertible debenture issued in december as a result of the registration rights on the shares acquired upon debt conversion and warrants exercised the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants are recorded as liabilities 
the initial fair value of million as of december  was treated as a discount to the million debenture  in addition  there was million of costs related to the issuance of the convertible debt  which are also amortized over the remaining current life of the note 
the term of the debenture may be adjusted based on the holder s election to extend the payment terms 
beginning with the first payment that was due december  the holder deferred the initial payment and may elect to defer the next eight quarterly payments 
each payment can be deferred for a month period  as such the installment payments may be delayed with the final payment on this debt may extend until december the amortization of the debt discount and deferred costs totaled million for each of the years ended december  and the fair value calculation at december  and was impacted by the change in maxwell s stock price and a reduction in the time which the holder has to exercise their rights 
the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants will be recalculated each reporting period and any difference in value from the prior period will be reflected in the statement of operations 
the future impact of fair value recalculations will be difficult to predict  given the historical volatility of maxwell s stock price  however  it is a non cash item and does not impact cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the use of cash for the years ended december    and was primarily attributed to operating losses from continuing operations  patent defense costs and to increased accounts receivable and inventory balances in support of higher revenue 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending has been focused on automating production processes for the high voltage and boostcap product lines 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which will be invested primarily in production equipment to increase capacity for the higher customer demand of high voltage and boostcap products 
the financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million with the majority of this coming from the company sale of million in stock  net of offering costs 
the sales were million shares of common stock in the second quarter of and million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter the sale of common stock was pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the financing activities for the years ended december  and were increases in cash of million and  respectively  with the majority of the activity in coming from the 
table of contents issuance of stock from options exercised and proceeds from long and short term borrowings 
in we sold approximately  shares of common stock and the company received proceeds of approximately million and placed a convertible debenture along with warrants to purchase shares of maxwell common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately million 
liquidity as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  investment in marketable securities with an additional million in and restricted cash for a total of million 
the cash restriction will be released after the convertible debenture is repaid 
we have a million swiss francs approximately  line of credit with a swiss bank for working capital  approximately  of the line was utilized as of december  in november we filed an s with the securities and exchange commission to  from time to time  sell up to an aggregate of million of the company s common stock  warrants or debt securities 
during the company sold million in stock 
the sales were million shares of common stock in the second quarter of and million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter during the year ended december  our patent defense costs totaled million  we anticipate our expenditures for to be less than if additional funds are required we have several options to raise capital that include negotiations to eliminate the current restriction on million of cash  bridge financing and or a private placement or public offering of our common stock  preferred stock  or debt 
debentures  short term and long term borrowings convertible debentures on december   the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures along with warrants to purchase shares of maxwell common stock 
the net proceeds of the issuance totaled approximately million after direct placement costs of approximately million 
the debenture is payable in quarterly installments of million from march through december  with the holder having the option to delay each installment months 
the holder elected to delay their first payment that was due in december the warrants initially issued were to purchase  shares of maxwell common stock while the debentures were convertible into million shares of maxwell s common stock  at any time at the option of the holder  at a strike price of per share 
the number of warrants  conversion shares and the strike price are subject to adjustment upon certain events such as the sale of equity securities by maxwell at a price below the strike price of per share 
in response to the equity sales in the number of warrants increased to  and the number of shares of common stock in the conversion feature increased to million shares 
interest is due quarterly with the interest rate tied to the federal funds rate plus per annum 
all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest may be paid in shares of maxwell s common stock at the company s option 
for fiscal year ended december  we made interest payments of  with  shares of company common stock 
after eighteen months from the issue date  maxwell may require that a specified amount of the principal of the debentures be converted if certain conditions are satisfied for a period of consecutive trading days 
the change in fair value on revaluation of debenture conversion rights and warrant liabilities represents the difference between the fair value of the warrants and debenture conversion between the two measurement dates using a black scholes calculation 
the effect of the fair market value adjustment are recorded as gain loss on embedded derivative liabilities 
the net fair value of the holder s and maxwell s conversion rights at december  and were liabilities of million  and million respectfully  these amounts are included in convertible debentures and long term debt on the balance sheet 

table of contents the warrants issued in connection with the issuance of the debentures had a fair value at december  and was  and million respectively and is included in stock warrants on the balance sheet

other events in  a customer brought to our attention a possible defect in a product that we sourced from another manufacturer and resold to the customer 
in late maxwell sa  initiated a proceeding in germany against the original manufacturer 
this is currently in a discovery phase for analysis of maxwell s claim of product defect manufactured by the source company 
these products were resold by maxwell to end customers who have experienced issues with the product 
in november of  an expert was appointed to performing experiments on the allegedly defective product to determine a if there is a defect  and b if there is a defect  if the defect is one stemming from manufacturing or from operating conditions 
the expert s opinion is expected no earlier than june the matter has not been resolved and we have not yet been able to determine what  if any  warranty exposure maxwell may have  and therefore  we have not recorded any specific warranty reserve provision for this issue 
we carry insurance that we believe would cover all or a portion of any obligation that might ultimately arise from this matter 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries purepulse  which suspended operations in and is classified as discontinued operations  has minority equity investors

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported 
table of contents amounts of revenues and expenses 
the following may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers 
for certain long term contracts revenue is recognized at the time costs are incurred and for licensing fees we recognize revenue from the right to manufacture products based on our proprietary ultracapacitor design 
product revenue is recognized  according to the guidelines of sec staff accounting bulletin numbers revenue recognition in financial statements  and revenue recognition  when title passes to the customer at either shipment from our facilities or receipt at the customer facility  depending on shipping terms  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
if a volume discount is offered  revenue is recognized at the lowest price to the customer 
this method has been consistently applied from period to period and there is no right of return 
revenue on fixed price government contracts is recognized at the time costs are incurred and is calculated on a percentage of completion basis  similar to contract accounting under statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and is limited by the funding of the prime contractor 
in prior years  certain continuing and discontinued segments involved revenues from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized at the time the costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in the reduction of revenue in excess of estimated provisions 
in turn  this could increase losses for the periods in which any such reduction occurs 
we recognize revenue that relates to multiple element contracts in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue to which this guidance applies includes a contract that grants a license to manufacture and market products in mainland china  using maxwell s proprietary large cell and multi cell module technology under a separate brand 
the contract  obligates the manufacturer to source ultracapacitor electrode material from maxwell 
the agreement has no general right of return and allows for no refunds 
additionally  we have contracts where all the elements of the agreement need to be delivered and accepted by the customer prior to any revenue being recognized for the deliverables 
from time to time the company has entered into multiple element contractual arrangements with elements of software that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
the company recognizes revenue on the delivered elements when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements exists in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  sop 
during fiscal  the company entered into two contracts whereby we have delivered certain elements and vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist 
as of december   the company has recorded approximately  of deferred revenue related to these contracts 
for contract research and development arrangements that contain up front or milestone based payments  we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared with the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by the company  utilizes an input based measure  specifically costs incurred to date  to determine proportional performance because we believe the use of an input measure is a reasonable surrogate of proportional performance compared to an output based measure  such as milestones 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are generally non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received not previously recognized as revenue 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventory and lower cost or market reserves we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and revisions in estimates may have a significant adverse impact on the balance sheet and statement of operations 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting units  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
we have one reporting unit and we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on the market value of the company s outstanding common stock 
the market value of the company s stock at december  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit and  therefore  the second step calculation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill was not necessary 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions  revisions in our assumptions or other unanticipated circumstances 
any impairment charges will adversely affect our results of operations 
convertible debentures we account for the conversion factor of our convertible debentures and warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires the conversion feature of our convertible debt to be separated from the host contract and presented as a derivative instrument 
eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock and eitf  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in issue no 
were also analyzed to determine whether the debt instrument is to be considered a conventional convertible debt instrument and classified in stockholders equity 
the convertible debentures issued on december  were evaluated and determined not to be conventionally convertible and  therefore  because of certain terms and provisions including liquidating damages under the associated registration rights agreement the embedded conversion option was bifurcated and has been accounted for as a derivative liability instrument 
the stock warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible debt on december  were also evaluated and determined to be a derivative instrument and  therefore  classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
the accounting guidance also requires that the conversion feature and warrants be recorded at fair value for each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in our statement of operations 
a black scholes valuation calculation was applied to both the conversion features and warrants at each period end date 
the december  valuation was used for the effective debt discount that these instruments represent 
the debt discount is amortized over the four year life of the debentures using the effective interest method 
the company s stock price is one input used in the black scholes calculation  which has a significant 
table of contents impact on the calculation 
the change in the company s stock price will have an effect on the gain or loss on embedded derivative liabilities in the statement of operations 
the volatility of the company s stock price is likely to generate large swings in the valuations of the conversion features and warrants in future periods 
stock compensation effective january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period 
we applied the modified prospective method  which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
under the modified prospective method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the expense recognition provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and awards subsequently modified or cancelled 
estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in the prior period the we applied the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transitions and disclosure 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we continued with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock option plans  we recognized  of compensation expense for the year ended december  impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
pending accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurement 
sfas provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
some provisions sfas are effective for us as of january  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no also includes an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we do not anticipate any material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of this standard 
off balance sheet arrangements none 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows foreign currency risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in switzerland 
maxwell sa has euro and local currency swiss franc revenue and local currency operating expenses and loans 
during the year ended december   maxwell sa had revenue of approximately million euro and million swiss franc 
changes in these currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue  expenses and debt 
we do not hedge our currency exposures 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million in debt  of which million is classified as long term debt 
we do not anticipate significant interest rate swings in the near future 
however  if they occur it may affect the consolidated balance sheet or the statement of operations 
the estimated impact on earnings or cash flow during the next fiscal year from a change of basis points in the interest rate would have a  effect on our related interest expense 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  high quality corporate issuers and money market accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our current policies do not allow the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   third parties manage approximately million of the investment portfolio under guidelines approved by our board of directors 
the balance of our cash is invested in money market accounts with banks 
a basis point change in the interest rate on our marketable securities would have  effect on our interest income 
fair value risk we record an adjustment on our convertible debenture adjusting the fair value of the embedded conversion options and stock warrants 
the change in these instruments is primarily impacted by the price of our stock at the end of each reporting period 
this adjustment creates a non cash effect on our statement of operations which may have a significant impact
