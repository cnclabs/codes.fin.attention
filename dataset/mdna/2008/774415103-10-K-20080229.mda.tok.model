you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item  selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
amounts may not recalculate due to rounding differences 
general we are a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced  high value added specialty chemicals and advanced materials 
we serve more than  customers across a wide variety of industries and geographic areas 
we operate through five business segments specialty chemicals  performance additives  titanium dioxide pigments  advanced ceramics  and specialty compounds 
our net sales consist of sales of our products  net of sales discounts  product returns and allowances 
in addition  net sales include shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis 
our cost of products sold consists of variable and fixed components 
our variable costs are proportional to volume and consist principally of raw materials  packaging and related supplies  certain energy costs  and certain distribution costs including inbound  outbound  and internal shipping and transfer costs 
our fixed costs are not significantly impacted by production volume and consist principally of certain fixed manufacturing costs and other distribution network costs  including warehousing 
fixed manufacturing costs comprise headcount related costs and overhead  including depreciation  periodic maintenance costs  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs and certain energy costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include research and development costs  sales and marketing  divisional management expenses and corporate services including cash management  legal  benefit plan administration and other administrative and professional services 
we are focused on growth  productivity  cost reduction  margin expansion  bolt on acquisitions  divestment of non core businesses and debt reduction 
in connection with this focus  among other things we have cut costs  reduced overhead and eliminated duplicative positions in both acquired and existing businesses 
in  we closed two uk facilities acquired in an october acquisition by our specialty compounds segment 
during the first quarter of  we closed facilities in the united states and the uk in the wafer reclaim business in our former electronics segment 
we also implemented other restructuring measures in our other segments  including the closure of our baulking  uk facility in our clay based additives business  we acquired the global color pigments business of elementis plc in august which is being integrated into our color pigments and service business within our performance additives segment  we completed the sale of our groupe novasep subsidiary in january and our united states wafer reclaim business in february  and we completed the sale of our electronics business  excluding our european wafer reclaim business  in december factors which affect our results of operations our markets because the businesses in our segments generally serve many unrelated end use markets  we discuss the principal market conditions on a segment basis rather than a consolidated basis 
the principal market conditions in our segments and regions in which we operate that impacted our results of operations during the periods presented include the following specialty chemicals demand for surface treatment products in our specialty chemicals segment generally follows the activity levels of metal processing manufacturers  including the automotive supply  steel and aerospace industries 
sales growth in the surface treatment business occurred in and continued in in most markets and regions served  especially in the european automotive  general industrial and aerospace industries  as price and volume increases more than offset raw material cost increases 
we expect the surface treatment business to grow in demand for our lithium products in the fine chemicals business line of our specialty chemicals segment is generally driven by demand for lithium carbonate in industrial applications  the aluminum business  glass ceramics  cement and the general demand in china 
sales of lithium products specifically used in life science applications depend on the trends in drug development and growth in pharmaceuticals markets as well as generic competition 
growth in the fine chemicals business occurred in and continued in in most market segments  which was driven by price increases in lithium salt applications  and strong demand for lithium applications  particularly sales of lithium specialty products to the pharmaceutical industry and lithium compounds 
growth in the fine chemicals business is expected in all market segments in  particularly driven by higher demand for lithium salt applications 
performance additives generally  a trend towards the increased use of colored concrete products in the north american construction market has historically had a positive effect on our color pigments and services business line 
while sales in our color pigments and services business in north america increased in on higher construction volumes and selling prices  a general slowdown in the construction market forced north american construction sales down in as a result of this slowdown  north american volumes are expected to be down again in however  sales in our color pigments and services business in north america are expected to be up in on higher selling prices to help recover raw material and energy cost increases and the favorable impact of the acquisition of the global color pigments business of elementis plc in august unlike north america  construction volumes in europe in our color pigments and services business increased slightly in the change in the market to environmentally advanced wood treatment chemical products  such as alkaline copper quaternary  or acq  and the phase out of chromated copper arsenate  or cca  for residential use previously had a positive impact on the timber treatment chemicals business  which is a leading supplier of these higher margin products 
however  the market position of acq was negatively impacted in and by customer losses and the increasing use of wood substitutes 
the expiration of the acq patent in may could also have a negative impact on our results of operations  as at least one new competitor has entered the market and others may follow 
although we commercialized the next generation timber treatment preservatives system ecolife in the third quarter of through our joint venture with rohm and haas  we do not expect this to have a significant impact in for  the major drivers of growth in the clay based additives business  which supplies specialty rheology modifiers and additives  both clay based and synthetic  to a variety of end use markets  were the acquisition of s d chemie s rheological additives and carbonless clay businesses  continued strength in oilfield sales and growth in additives for water based coatings 
sales were up slightly in as higher oilfield volumes and increased selling prices for coatings and inks were partially offset by lower carbonless applications 
we expect sales growth in in coatings and inks and oilfield applications 
raw material costs have increased in general in the performance additives segment since and continue to trend upward 
in the color pigments and services and clay based additives business  selling price increases were initiated in and continued in to partially offset the increases in raw material and energy costs  specifically iron oxide for color pigments and services and quaternary amine quat for clay based additives 
continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates are expected to result in substantial cost increases in chinese manufactured raw materials used in our color pigments and services business 
in  the timber treatment chemicals business experienced record high costs for copper  a primary component in acq  and was unable to pass on these increased material costs to customers in however  selling price increases were implemented in to offset higher copper costs 
although selling price increases were implemented in to offset raw material cost increases  our ability to pass on additional selling price increases in is uncertain in these businesses 
titanium dioxide pigments demand for our titanium dioxide products in anatase grade is driven mainly by demand in the synthetic fiber industry  while demand for titanium dioxide products in rutile grade and our functional additives is driven by demand in the coatings  paper and plastics industries 
throughout  we experienced pricing pressure from global suppliers in asia  specifically chinese suppliers related to titanium dioxide products in anatase grade 
we also experienced pricing pressures on our titanium products in rutile grade 
volumes and selling prices in the fiber anatase business increased in but volumes and selling prices were lower in however  we expect sales in the fiber anatase business to be higher in sales of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade were down slightly in as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices 
sales of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade were up slightly in on increased volumes  partially offset by lower selling prices 
we expect sales of these rutile grade products to continue to be up in our functional additives business increased in and on higher selling prices and volumes 
we expect sales in the functional additives business to continue to be up in advanced ceramics demand for our ceramic medical devices is mainly tied to the aging population in europe and the united states 
although the volume of our products used in medical device applications sold experienced double digit growth each year from through  in some customers in the us reduced their demand due to high inventory levels and delayed approvals resulting in lower volumes 
however  growth of our medical device applications increased in on higher volumes and is expected to continue to increase in despite the negative impact of pricing pressure from asian competitors  sales of ceramic products for use in cutting tool products and mechanical systems were higher in and due to volume increases 
this growth is expected to continue in selling prices in our electronic products business were lower in  and in  sales were lower primarily on decreased volumes 
sales in our electronic products business are expected to be down in on lower volumes and selling prices 
sales of our multi functional applications were higher in from increased volumes and are expected to continue to increase slightly in on higher volumes 
specialty compounds our largest product line in the specialty compounds segment is wire and cable compounds 
sales within this product line are dependent upon the telecommunications market and related sectors  specifically demand for high end voice and data communication wire and cable  for which our specialty compounds segment is a significant provider of sheathing materials 
newly developed non halogen products for wire and cable data communication  military and other applications have expanded business in north america for those applications and created opportunities in europe 
although sales of wire and cable products were up slightly in and again in  sales growth in was due to the acquisition of the megolon division of scapa group  plc 
in  the wire and cable business was negatively impacted by a general downturn in the wire and cable market 
sales of wire and cable products are expected to be up slightly in  although results are expected to be negatively impacted by continued weakness in the wire and cable market 
most of the other end use markets for which specialty compounds products are used generally track growth of gross domestic product  but many are also application specific  such as automotive 
our net sales in consumer industrial thermoplastic elastomers were up in and and we expect continued growth in these markets in net sales of regulated packaging were up in  but were lower in and are expected to continue to be lower for we are focusing more of our efforts towards increasing high margin specialty products  in particular  thermoplastic elastomers  and less of our efforts in automotive and footwear 
the price of ammonium octamolybdate aom and polyvinyl chloride pvc resin and plasticizers  key raw materials used in the production of wire and cable products  increased from through as a result  selling price increases were successfully initiated in and to help offset the raw materials price increase 
although raw material prices were slightly lower in  they are expected to be higher in global exposure we operate a geographically diverse business 
of our net sales  were shipments to europe  to north america predominantly the united states and to the rest of the world 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
we estimate that we sold to customers in more than countries during this period 
currently  we serve our diverse and extensive customer base with manufacturing facilities in countries 
consequently  we are exposed to global economic and political changes  particularly currency fluctuations that could impact our profitability 
our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars or euros 
our results of operations and financial condition have been historically impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
for the year ended december  the average exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar was higher compared to as a result  our net sales  gross profit and operating income were positively impacted 
historically  however  our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations because  in general  sales and costs of products sold are generated or incurred in the same currency  subject to certain exceptions 
raw materials raw materials constituted approximately of our cost of products sold 
we have a broad raw material base  with the cost of no single raw material representing more than of our cost of products sold in nonetheless  the significant price fluctuations our raw materials have experienced in the past during periods of high demand have had an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in particular  higher prices for copper used in the timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment had a negative impact on results in and we cannot accurately predict the impact of any future price increases for raw materials or any raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions 
in addition  we may not be able to pass on raw material price increases to our customers 
see details of our ten most significant raw materials in terms of dollars in item  business raw materials 
energy costs in  energy purchases represented approximately of our cost of products sold 
however  within certain business lines  such as our titanium dioxide pigments segment and the color pigments and services and clay based additives businesses of our performance additives segment  energy costs are more significant 
the cost of products sold for certain of our businesses  including color pigments and services and clay based additives  increases when the price of natural gas in north america rises 
natural gas prices were volatile and continued to increase in north america in  but were relatively stable in in contrast  natural gas prices in europe  where our titanium dioxide pigments segment is located  have historically been relatively stable  although prices were higher in and income taxes as of december   the company has us federal and foreign corporate tax loss carryforwards excluding state and local amounts of approximately million  of which million expire in years through and of which million have no current expiration date 
included in the us federal and foreign carryforwards are us federal tax loss carryforwards of million  of which million are subject to limitations and expire in years through and of which million expire in and beyond 
the company also has state and local tax loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring in years through the worldwide valuation allowance increased by million to million at december  of this amount  million represents an increase to other comprehensive income  million was reversed as a result of the reduction in us deferred tax assets primarily due to the sale of the electronics business and million represents an increase recorded to goodwill 
the remainder related to foreign currency translation adjustments 
acquisitions during the periods presented  we made certain selective acquisitions pursuant to our business strategy of achieving profitable growth 
see note  acquisitions  for further details 
special charges and credits during the periods presented  we incurred certain special charges  along with certain other items  substantially in connection with the establishment of the post acquisition corporate entity that incorporates the business segments acquired in the dynamit nobel acquisition as well as in connection with the ipo 
these items include systems organization establishment expenses  restructuring and related charges  foreign exchange gains and losses and inventory write up reversals 
see items excluded from adjusted ebitda section in note  segment information  for a discussion of special charges and credits recorded in the years ended december   and special note regarding non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the sec as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time in this management s discussion and analysis  we disclose non gaap financial measures  primarily adjusted ebitda  as defined below 
definition of adjusted ebitda the presentation of consolidated adjusted ebitda contained in this report is calculated using the definition set forth in the senior secured credit agreement as a basis and reflects management s interpretations thereof 
adjusted ebitda  which is referred to under the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated ebitda  is defined in the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated earnings which  as defined in the senior secured credit agreement  equals income loss before the deduction of income taxes of rockwood specialties group  inc and the restricted subsidiaries as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  excluding extraordinary items plus interest expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  including amortization of deferred financing fees  extraordinary losses and non recurring charges  non cash charges  losses on asset sales  restructuring charges or reserves including severance  relocation costs and one time compensation charges and costs relating to the closure of facilities  expenses paid by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition  the senior secured credit agreement  the granting of liens under the security documents as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  the indenture governing the notes and the offering of the notes and any other related transactions  any expenses or charges incurred in connection with any issuance of debt or equity securities  any fees and expenses related to permitted acquisitions  any deduction for minority interest expense  and items arising in connection with cca litigation related to our timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment  less extraordinary gains and non recurring gains  non cash gains  and gains on asset sales  in all cases  subject to certain exclusions 
for presentation purposes within this report  we use the computation set forth in our senior secured credit agreement as a basis which reflects management s interpretations thereof 
management has determined that stock based compensation costs  which are non cash charges  will not be an adjustment in calculating adjusted ebitda as these costs will be an ongoing recurring cost to the company 
these costs are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
specifically  calculation of adjusted ebitda according to the indenture underlying our notes excludes certain adjustments prescribed within the senior secured credit agreement 
given that borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement are secured by most of our assets and given that the calculation does not materially differ from the calculation of adjusted ebitda for performance measurement purposes  we believe this is the most appropriate computation of adjusted ebitda to present 
management s uses we use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis to assess our operating performance 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is helpful in highlighting trends in our overall business because the items excluded in calculating adjusted ebitda have been deemed by management to have little or no bearing on our day to day operating performance 
it is also the most significant criterion in our calculation of performance based cash bonuses and our determination of whether certain performance based stock options and restricted stock units vest  all of which are tied to adjusted ebitda targets 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because our senior secured credit agreement and indenture governing the notes contain financial covenants that are determined based on adjusted ebitda 
these covenants are material terms of these agreements  because they govern substantially all of our long term debt  which in turn represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our senior secured credit facilities our maximum total leverage ratio and our minimum interest coverage ratio  in particular could result in the lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
any such acceleration could also lead to the noteholders accelerating the maturity of the notes 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants in the indenture governing the notes  we cannot engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness or making certain payments 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a segment basis as the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker  our chief executive officer  to evaluate the ongoing performance of our business segments and reporting units 
on a segment basis  we define adjusted ebitda as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization  certain non cash gains and charges  certain other special gains and charges determined by our senior management to be non recurring gains and charges and certain items deemed by our senior management to have little or no bearing on the day to day operating performance of our business segments and reporting units 
the adjustments made to operating income directly correlate with the adjustments to net income in calculating adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis pursuant to the senior secured credit agreement  which reflects management s interpretations thereof 
limitations adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for us gaap measures of earnings and cash flows 
material limitations associated with making the adjustments to our earnings and cash flows to calculate adjusted ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures  include the cash portion of interest expense  net  income tax provision benefit  and restructuring as well as non recurring charges related to securities issuance  acquisition activities  and systems organization establishment  generally represent charges gains which may significantly affect funds available to use in our operating  investing and financing activities  non operating foreign exchange gains losses  although not immediately affecting cash used in investing activities  may affect the amount of funds needed to service our debt if those currency impacts remain in place as we meet our future principal repayment obligations  and depreciation  amortization  non cash gains charges and impairment charges  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of the plant  equipment and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and or market our products  these items may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  for development or acquisition of intangible assets or relevant trends causing asset value changes 
an investor or potential investor may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
management compensates for the limitations of using non gaap financial measures by using them only to supplement our us gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest or operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measures 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to us gaap financial measures and other financial information  in each case included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to those of other companies 
results of operations actual results of operations the following table presents the major components of our operations on an actual basis and adjusted ebitda the reconciliation to net income is set forth in reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and  including as a percentage of net sales  for the periods presented

year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview net sales increased million for the year ended december  compared with the prior year driven by increased selling prices of million  strong demand in a number of our segments  particularly in our specialty chemicals segment  and higher volumes related to acquisitions 
the positive impact of currency changes of million also had a favorable impact on net sales 
see further discussion by segment below 
operating income and adjusted ebitda also increased for the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of the sales increases noted above 
operating income and adjusted ebitda were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs in most businesses 
net income from continuing operations increased million in the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to the reasons noted above 
this was partially offset by costs of million incurred in the second quarter of to redeem our notes and higher interest expense recorded in the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to an increase in mark to market losses on our interest rate hedging instruments 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased million in the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to the sale of groupe novasep in january  partially offset by the tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of related to the favorable treatment on the sale of rohner ag in see further details in note  discontinued operations 
the gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax  of million for the year ended december  was comprised of the gain of million net of taxes on the sale of groupe novasep and a gain of million net of taxes on the sale of the electronics business  excluding the european wafer reclaim business 
net income increased million in the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to the reasons noted above 
net sales specialty chemicals 
net sales increased million over the prior year  primarily on higher selling prices  as well as increased volumes and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
in the fine chemicals business  higher selling prices of lithium products  as well as increased volumes  had a favorable impact on net sales 
net sales in the surface treatment business were favorably impacted by higher selling prices and increased volumes in most markets  particularly in european automotive  aerospace and general industrial applications 
performance additives 
net sales increased million over the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of the global color pigments business of elementis plc completed on august   increased selling prices of acq products and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
this was partially offset by lower construction volumes in north america in our color pigments and services business and lower volumes in our timber treatment chemicals business 
titanium dioxide pigments 
net sales increased million over the prior year due to the positive impact of currency changes of million 
excluding the impact of currency changes  net sales were down as lower volumes and prices of titanium dioxide in anatase grade were partially offset by higher selling prices for functional additives and higher volumes of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade 
advanced ceramics 
net sales increased million over the prior year primarily due to the positive impact of currency changes of million and the impact of bolt on acquisitions made in april and may higher volumes in most businesses  particularly in medical  cutting tools  mechanical systems  and multi functional ceramics also had a favorable impact on net sales 
this was partially offset by lower selling prices and volume declines in electronic applications 
specialty compounds 
net sales increased million over the prior year due to higher volumes resulting from an acquisition made in october in the wire and cable business and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
corporate and other 
net sales decreased million over the prior year primarily due to the sale of our us wafer reclaim business in the first quarter of gross profit gross profit increased million over the prior year primarily due to the selling price increases noted above  as well as productivity improvements and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
this was partially offset by raw material cost increases  particularly from the impact of higher zinc and other raw material costs in our specialty chemicals segment  higher iron oxide and cobalt raw material costs in our color pigments and services business and higher copper costs in our timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended december  versus in the year ended december  gross profit in includes a reduction of million primarily due to an inventory write up reversal related to the acquisition of the global color pigments business of elementis plc 
in  gross profit was lower due to an inventory write up reversal of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased million over the prior year primarily due to the impact of currency changes of million 
higher sg a costs were also recorded in a number of our segments related to increased sales volumes 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december   as a result of higher net sales impacted by selling price increases 
impairment charges we recorded an impairment charge of million in related to the writedown of machinery and equipment in the fine chemicals division of the specialty chemicals segment 
restructuring charges  net we recorded million of restructuring charges in the year ended december  for miscellaneous restructuring actions in the specialty chemicals  performance additives  advanced ceramics and corporate and other segments 
in the corporate and other segment  million of restructuring charges were recorded for the year ended december  primarily related to the restructuring of the wafer reclaim business 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in the year ended december  for miscellaneous restructuring actions in the specialty chemicals  performance additives  advanced ceramics and corporate and other segments for miscellaneous headcount reductions and facility closures 
see note  restructuring liability  for further details 
gain on sale of assets we recorded gains of million  primarily related to the sale of our u 
s wafer reclaim business  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating income specialty chemicals 
operating income increased million primarily due to the impact of higher sales in both the surface treatment and fine chemicals businesses and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
this increase was partially offset by higher raw material costs of million primarily related to zinc and other raw materials 
performance additives 
operating income decreased million over the prior year due to the lower sales volumes discussed above  and higher raw material costs of million  particularly copper costs in the timber treatment chemicals business  higher iron oxide and cobalt costs in our color pigments and services business and higher quat costs in our clay based additives business 
higher depreciation and amortization costs of million primarily due to the viance  llc joint venture formed in january and the acquisition of the global color pigments business of elementis plc  along with increased inventory write up reversal charges of million primarily related to the elementis acquisition  also had an unfavorable impact on operating income 
these decreases were partially offset by the selling price increases noted above and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
titanium dioxide pigments 
operating income decreased million over the prior year due to higher raw material costs of million  particularly zinc and other raw material costs  higher energy costs of million  an unfavorable mix and lower selling prices of titanium dioxide products 
this decrease was partially offset by the positive impact of currency changes of million 
advanced ceramics 
operating income increased million over the prior year primarily due to the impact of increased sales in most businesses  productivity improvements and the positive impact of currency changes of million 
the impact of a bolt on acquisition made in april also had a favorable impact on operating income 
this increase was partially offset by lower selling prices and increased depreciation and amortization costs of million related to the acquisition discussed above 
specialty compounds 
operating income increased million due to higher sales volumes from the acquisition completed in october and a favorable product mix  partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization costs of million related to an acquisition in october corporate and other 
operating loss decreased million over the prior year primarily due to higher gains on asset sales of million primarily related to the sale of our us wafer reclaim business and lower professional fees incurred regarding systems and internal control documentation required in connection with the company s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of this was partially offset by additional stock compensation expense related to the may equity grant  higher legal accruals and increased restructuring charges 
other income expenses interest expense 
interest expense increased million in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the years ended december  and included losses of million and gains of million  respectively  representing the movement in the mark to market valuation of our interest rate hedging instruments 
the remaining interest expense decrease of million is primarily due to lower interest expense related to the redemption in may of the notes in the aggregate amount of million 
interest income 
interest income increased million in the year ended december  compared to the prior year from interest earned on cash from operations and interest earned on cash equivalents stemming from the net cash proceeds received from the sale of groupe novasep and the formation of the viance  llc joint venture in january loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in may  we paid a redemption premium of million and wrote off million of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of the notes in may refinancing expenses 
in march  we expensed million related to the fourth amendment of the senior secured credit agreement resulting in a basis point reduction on our new tranche g term loans 
foreign exchange gain  net 
for the years ended december  and  we had foreign exchange gains of million and million  respectively  primarily related to euro denominated debt  cash and inter company loans 
other  net 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of income in connection with the correction of an immaterial error related to a previously unrecorded asset in the titanium dioxide pigments segment of million

liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been and will continue to be cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries

we received net cash proceeds of million 
we also paid approximately million in fees and expenses associated with this transaction and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes

our primary liquidity requirements are working capital  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our debt service requirements and other contractual obligations and commitments over the next several years are significant and are substantially higher than historical amounts 
we believe that our currently available sources of liquidity will be sufficient for these needs 
furthermore  any future major acquisitions  business combinations or similar transactions will likely require additional capital resources 
if our present operating performance and current market conditions continue  we believe that such resources will be available to us for certain transactions 
we would need access to alternative sources of liquidity for larger acquisitions such as through additional borrowings  equity issuances or other sources  and we may not have access to these sources for a variety of reasons 
see item  business  and item a  risk factors 
we believe that based on current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our industry and markets  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate for and the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt and fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we continue to take actions to reduce costs and exit unprofitable businesses  in part to improve our long term liquidity 
we expect this to further improve our short and long term liquidity 
if our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our currently existing liquidity requirements  we may be forced to use other means available to us  such as to reduce or delay capital expenditures and seek additional capital 
we may not have adequate capital for future acquisitions  business combinations or similar transactions

covenant compliance 
in addition to the affirmative and restrictive covenants  the senior secured credit agreement contains the following financial covenants that are determined based on our adjusted ebitda  which reflects management s interpretations thereof a leverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december   net debt total debt plus capital lease obligations  minus cash up to a maximum of million to adjusted ebitda must be less than to  for such period  our ratio equaled to  and an interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december   adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense interest expense  net excluding deferred debt issuance cost amortization and the movements in the mark to market value of our interest rate and cross currency interest rate derivatives must be at least to  for such period  our ratio equaled to please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations definitions of adjusted ebitda  for a discussion of the definition of adjusted ebitda used in calculating our financial covenants 
these covenants are material terms of the senior secured credit agreement 
non compliance with these covenants or other covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indenture governing the notes  which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable 
because the indenture governing the notes defines an event of default to include  among other things  a default under any other debt obligation in excess of million that could cause the acceleration of such obligation  any acceleration under the senior secured credit agreement would also result in a default under the indenture governing these notes  which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable 
the senior secured credit agreement contains a similar cross default provision for indebtedness in excess of million  therefore  a default under the indenture governing the notes or other indebtedness may likewise cause the lenders to declare the principal and interest on the then outstanding senior secured credit facilities immediately due and payable 
the indenture governing the notes prohibits us from incurring additional debt  subject to certain permitted incurrences  unless the fixed charge coverage ratio  which is the ratio of adjusted ebitda as defined therein excluding certain adjustments permitted under the senior secured credit agreement to fixed charges as defined therein  for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to in addition  the indenture prohibits us from making restricted payments such as dividends or other equity distributions  repurchases of capital stock or restricted investments  subject to certain permitted payments  unless  among other things  the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to for the four fiscal quarter period ended december   the fixed charge coverage ratio equaled to this covenant is a material term of the indenture governing the notes

capital expenditures rockwood s capital expenditures in consisted primarily of replacements of worn  obsolete or damaged equipment as well as investments in new equipment  mostly for our specialty chemicals  performance additives  and titanium dioxide pigments segments 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures  excluding capital leases  were million 
capital expenditures for are expected to approximate expenditure levels 
for the years ended december  and  our capital expenditures  excluding capital leases  amounted to million and million  respectively 
we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under safety  health and environmental she laws 
for the year ended december   our capital expenditures for she matters totaled approximately million  excluding costs to maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for  we estimate capital expenditures for compliance with she laws to be at similar levels  however  because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to changes in and new she laws  we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required to comply with these laws including the eu s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation 
see note  commitments and contingencies  regulatory developments for a discussion of reach 
we are applying our capital discipline and stringent controls to reduce our future capital expenditures 
our annual capital expenditures could increase in amount  but we do not believe they will change significantly from current levels in proportion to the size of the combined entity or as a percentage of net sales 
foreign currency related transactions as of december   based on the exchange rate of   million of the debt outstanding is denominated in euros million 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company incurs obligations which include guarantees related to contract completion  regulatory compliance and product performance 
under certain circumstances  these obligations are supported through the issuance of letters of credit and other bank guarantees 
as of december   the company had approximately million of letters of credit and other bank guarantees  of which million will expire in through the remaining guarantees have no specified expiration date 
this amount includes outstanding letters of credit of million that reduced our availability under the senior secured credit facility 
in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company anticipates fulfilling its performance obligations 
commitments and contingencies see note  commitments and contingencies  for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates include assessing  among other things the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  the use and recoverability of inventory  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the fair values of equity awards in determining stock based compensation expense  impairment of goodwill  property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  and the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following to be the most critical accounting policies and estimates affecting preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
product sales are recognized when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that we have adequate credit granting procedures in place and operating effectively so that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a low incidence of uncollectible accounts 
additionally  credit insurance is purchased at times by certain of our businesses  particularly in europe  to protect against collection risk 
accruals are made for sales returns based on our experience and for other allowances based on the terms of allowance programs put in place 
although we believe that sufficient experience and history exists to make reasonable estimates as to such accruals and allowances  actual results can differ depending on market conditions 
impairment accounting 
the recoverability of goodwill is reviewed on an annual basis during the fourth quarter 
additionally  the recoverability of goodwill  long lived tangible  and certain intangible assets is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
initial goodwill impairment review begins with the estimate of fair value of each reporting unit generally based on an industry metric such as the ratio of enterprise value commonly defined as market capitalization  plus long term debt  less cash to adjusted ebitda of the reporting unit for the current year and the following year budget 
if a potential impairment is identified  we may expand the review to take into account expected future cash flows in subsequent years 
similarly  when we test for impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill we initially review the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset or asset group collectively asset 
if it appears that the asset is impaired based on undiscounted cash flows  the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated on a present value basis by multiplying the estimated future annual cash flows of the asset by the then current enterprise value ratio a discounted measure or by a discount factor appropriate to the related reporting unit  in accordance with paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the asset or goodwill exceeds the discounted cash flow or other measure of fair value 
we did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss for the years ended december   and as a result of the impairment analysis that was performed 
these calculations are based on inherent assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and appropriate benchmark peer companies or groups 
subsequent changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
for example  if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  we might have had a potential goodwill impairment of million in one of our reporting units 
if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  we might have had a potential goodwill impairment of million in one of our reporting units 
if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  we might have had a potential goodwill impairment of million in one of our reporting units 
as noted above  if we had discovered such a potential impairment we might have expanded the review to prepare more detailed estimates of future cash flows in subsequent years  which might have resulted in a different impairment assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  management performed an impairment review of a business within the fine chemicals division of the specialty chemicals segment due to poor profitability 
based on this review  an impairment charge of million was recorded to write down the full value of machinery and equipment 
in  we reviewed for impairment the assets of our rohner ag facility within our former groupe novasep reporting unit see note  discontinued operations  for further details 
based on this review  it was determined that an impairment charge of million to the remaining amount of property  plant and equipment of the rohner facility should be recorded 
as discussed  our groupe novasep subsidiary was sold in january and the results of this subsidiary are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during  we did not have any other circumstances that caused us to review the values of any other individual long lived assets for impairment 
business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  we are required to allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
examples of material estimates from our previous acquisitions are the fair values of work in process and finished goods inventories are estimated based on selling price less selling profit 
the calculation of selling profit requires a judgment on the relative margins derived from manufacturing vs 
marketing efforts 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment can be estimated by a variety of methods taking into account market values  replacement cost  and remaining useful life 
although market value and replacement cost is sometimes readily obtainable  often this requires judgment  as does determining the estimated remaining useful life 
when we believe that property  plant and equipment acquired will be material to our overall balance sheet  or that fair value might represent a significant difference from the historical cost net of accumulated depreciation of such assets  we have engaged an independent appraiser to provide us with expert advice on such estimates  as we have done in our recent acquisitions 
however  it is not uncommon for appraisers to differ on the valuation of items such as manufacturing equipment where a ready secondary market does not exist 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as patents and other intellectual property  customer lists  and trademarks  can be estimated by discounted cash flow and return on royalties 
the process utilized to identify intangible assets is consistent with the requirements of sfas when considered material  we have engaged an independent appraiser to provide expert advice in the identification of intangible assets acquired  valuation of such assets and determination of the estimated useful life 
an independent appraiser  with management s oversight and input  is required to make judgments and estimates that could cause such appraisals to differ from those of other appraisal experts 
in order to determine the fair value of intangible assets and other long term assets  a discount rate and royalty rate is determined in conjunction with our independent appraiser 
the royalty rate is based on professional judgment taking into consideration the type of product  market and perceived strength 
the discount rate and royalty rate has a material impact on the determination of the fair value 
purchase accounting often involves the same critical estimates that are required in our ordinary course of business including estimates of deferred tax assets or liabilities  pension liabilities  restructuring liabilities and legal and environmental reserves 
goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
while goodwill itself does not represent an estimate  under sfas we must assign goodwill to one or more reporting units 
allocation of goodwill to reporting units requires judgments about the relative fair values of reporting units including the fair value of their identifiable assets and estimates as to the present value of future cash flows expected from the reporting units as adjusted by weighted average and or risk adjusted costs of capital 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 
some of our business combinations have complex terms that may result in conflicting claims between buyer and seller concerning the purchase price itself 
management is required to assess the probability and amount or range of amounts of such claims  and  where possible  determine the most likely amount due 
legal matters 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  intellectual property and environmental matters  of a nature that can be expected in our business 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these matters in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
the probability that a contingent liability has been incurred is regularly assessed by our legal staff  based on periodic reviews of available facts and circumstances for our legal matters  with senior operating and finance management both at the business accountable for the potential liability and at our corporate offices 
this is supplemented where applicable by consultation with outside counsel 
we do not believe it is informative to quantify past experience at assessing probability or estimating exposure since material matters of this nature at rockwood often represent unique situations with little applicability to the assessment of probability or estimation of potential liability regarding other legal matters 
it is our policy to disclose such matters when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
environmental matters 
we accrue costs of a non capital nature related to environmental clean up when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized  and expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or present operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible are immediately expensed 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement 
as such  it can be extremely difficult to accurately estimate such costs 
we do not include anticipated recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties in our accruals for environmental liabilities 
we have estimated and established financial reserves relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and remediation and closure costs 
on a consolidated basis  we have accrued approximately million for known environmental liabilities as of december  given that these obligations may be paid relieved over extended time periods years in some cases  charges or credits to operations may be required as information is gathered and estimates refined 
we have evaluated our total environmental exposure based on currently available data and believe that such environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
if matters previously identified by management are resolved in a manner different from original estimates  there is the potential for a material adverse effect on operating results or cash flows in any one accounting period 
see note  commitments and contingencies 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges from time to time that represent expenses incurred in connection with consolidations and cessations of certain of our operations as well as headcount reduction programs 
these charges consist primarily of write offs of surplus assets and severance costs 
these charges are based on various factors including the employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary levels and local governmental legislation 
at the time a related charge is recorded  we calculate our best estimate based upon detailed analysis 
although significant changes are not expected  actual costs may differ from these estimates 
for example  we have accrued liabilities of million as of december  to cover restructuring liabilities for employee severance  facility closure and relocation costs 
the portion of this accrued liability that was recorded as part of purchase accounting is not charged to operations  but was recorded as part of goodwill 
in the event that our estimates of such costs are too low  an additional charge to operations would be required 
income taxes 
valuation allowance we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence weighted toward evidence that is objectively verifiable 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income or decrease goodwill for any net deferred tax assets acquired in the dynamit nobel acquisition in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our recorded net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
we have cumulative net operating loss carry forwards in the us  germany and italy for which we have reserved 
the valuation allowance also includes certain states in the us as we have concluded realizability of these net operating loss carry forwards is not more likely than not 
we have not recorded valuation allowances on a significant portion of our german net operating loss carry forwards as we have considered positive evidence such as forecasted future taxable income based on historical taxable income adjusted for charges which are not indicative of future operations and as the carry forward period is indefinite 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  sfas paragraph  requires consideration of future taxable income and other available evidence when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
various assumptions and strategies including elections for tax purposes are implicit in estimates of forecasted future taxable income 
we believe that  in situations in which future realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on taxable income from future operations  sfas requires the relative significance of cumulative losses be addressed within the guidance provided in paragraphs and accordingly  in assessing the realization of us jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards for the years ended december   and  and  considering future taxable income  we have identified the key elements of both positive and negative evidence and evaluated such evidence by applying the guidance provided by paragraphs and of sfas the worldwide valuation allowance increased by million to million at december  of this amount  million represents an increase to other comprehensive income  million was reversed as a result of the reduction in us deferred tax assets primarily due to the sale of the electronics business and million represents an increase recorded to goodwill 
the remainder related to foreign currency translation adjustments 
as of december   we had three years of net cumulative losses in the uk as such  we evaluated the net deferred tax assets of approximately million related to our uk entities 
our policy to determine future income available to realize the deferred tax assets is based on determining the normalized annual taxable income 
based on our steady state analysis prepared in accordance with our policy  we had sufficient income available to utilize the deferred tax assets 
the steady state analysis prepared includes material management assumptions that relate to the appropriateness of including non recurring permanent cost reductions as well as the impact from recent acquisitions in the uk furthermore  we have identified a tax planning strategy which would reduce the amount of future losses as part of our evaluation of evidence regarding the need for a valuation allowance 
based on our steady state analysis and available tax planning strategy  we have concluded that no valuation allowance is needed as of december  we are committed to buying and selling businesses within our portfolio of businesses as opportunities arise to enhance our overall results 
we are committed to selling assets which are non core and which would generate a taxable gain in the event of expiring us federal nol s 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax provision on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
an uncertain income tax provision will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
the company is subject to taxation in the us  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
as part of the adoption of fin  we evaluated all tax positions taken including the existing tax liabilities recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and evaluated whether such tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
if the position met the more likely than not threshold test  we estimated the amount of the benefit that would be more than likely to be sustained upon ultimate settlement 
the estimate includes management s judgment of the amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement  taking into account all facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
although we have a full valuation allowance on the us net deferred tax assets and certain us states  in accordance with fin  we have evaluated the us positions as well as foreign positions 
liabilities associated with positions taken as part of purchase accounting have been recorded as part of goodwill 
based on our year end analysis  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million on a gross basis 
the ultimate settlement of this liability is subject to tax audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations 
as such  actual results will differ from our estimates 
in accordance with our policy  we have offset the gross fin liability in respect of our uncertain tax positions against deferred taxes where settlement of such liability would reduce tax loss carry forwards 
on a net basis  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have declined improved by million in stock based compensation 
we have a stock based compensation plan which includes stock options  restricted stock and other stock based awards 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  stock based compensation  for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  we record stock compensation expense associated with our equity awards 
the accounting for stock compensation is a critical accounting estimate  which requires judgments and assumptions that have an impact on our financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions of expected term  expected volatility and risk free rates 
changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate 
the fair value of our performance restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our stock 
these performance based equity awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance goals 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  pensions  postemployment and postretirement costs 
in connection with prior year acquisitions  particularly the kkr and dynamit nobel acquisition  rockwood assumed responsibility for the pension and postretirement benefits for substantially all of the employees of the businesses acquired that were active as of the date of the acquisition 
for the kkr acquisition  obligations related to retired and terminated vested employees as of such date remained the responsibility of the seller  and accordingly  these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
postretirement benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
postemployment benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  with consideration to the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases due to marketplace conditions and or inflation and demographic experience such as retirement and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions or benefit payments 
for funded plans  the plan trustee obtains an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets and prepares estimates of expected returns based on target asset allocations multiplied by current marketplace rates of return for comparable assets 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore are likely to affect our recognized expense in those periods 
we cannot predict these bond yields or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to our stockholders equity for minimum pension liability in subsequent years will be significant 
estimated sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity and annual pension expense to a increase decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below as of and for the year ended december  the estimates were based on inquiries of the actuaries of plans representing approximately of our global pension obligations as of december  remaining plans are assumed to have similar sensitivities 
the december  funded status and stockholders equity are affected by assumptions as of december  while annual pension expense is affected by december  assumptions as of december  in millions us plans non us plans pension impact of a change in discount rate funded status funded status a equity expense basis points basis points a based on sensitivities provided by actuaries for the main german and uk schemes 
other countries plans are assumed to have similar sensitivities 
as shown above  changes in the discount rate can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans and stockholders equity 
as noted above  the funded status and stockholders equity of our funded plans might also be significantly affected by assumptions concerning expected return of plan assets 
however  given that most of our pension obligations do not require funding  such sensitivity would be significantly less 
useful lives of plant and equipment 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for our plant and equipment 
depreciation is determined using the straight line method over the various asset classes 
estimated lives range from years for buildings and improvements including land improvements  years for machinery and equipment  years for furniture and fixtures and years for mining rights 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our depreciation charge or will write off or write down obsolete assets 
to the extent that our plant and equipment actual useful lives differ from management s estimates by percent  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates 
useful lives of other intangible assets 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related amortization charges for our other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily consist of patents and other intellectual property  trade names and trademarks  and customer relationships 
patents and other intellectual property are recorded at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition and are being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives  ranging from years 
trade names and trademarks are being amortized over years  customer relationships are amortized from years and supply agreements are being amortized from years 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization charge or will write off or write down obsolete other intangible assets 
to the extent that the actual useful lives of our other intangible assets differ from management s estimates by percent  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives 
when used  derivatives are employed as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk we had million and million of variable rate debt after hedging outstanding as of december  and  respectively  at the then applicable exchange rate 
any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will also be at a variable rate 
although we are not required under the terms of any of our long term debt facilities to hedge  or otherwise protect against interest rate fluctuation in our variable rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates related to variable rate debt 
as of december   these contracts cover notional amounts of million at a rate of and million at rates ranging from to 
as of december   these contracts cover notional amounts of million at rates of and and million at rates ranging from to 
these derivative contracts effectively convert a portion of the senior secured credit facilities to fixed rate obligations 
the maturity dates of the hedges are between july and july in the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps that will effectively replace the swaps that will expire in these swaps become effective in july and will serve to convert a portion of our floating rate debt instruments to fixed rate obligations for the contract periods 
these swaps mature between november and july we elected not to apply hedge accounting for these interest rate swaps and have recorded the mark to market of these derivative transactions as a component of interest expense 
we may in the future consider adjusting the amounts covered by these derivative contracts to better suit our capital structure 
each increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average interest rate would change the annual interest expense by million in and foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we operate a geographically diverse business  with of our net sales in generated from customers in europe  in north america predominantly in the united states and from the rest of the world based upon customer ship to locations 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
our diverse and extensive customer base is served by manufacturing facilities in countries 
although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries  our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars and euros 
our results of operations and financial condition are therefore impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
approximately of our net sales were derived from subsidiaries whose local currency is the euro 
this increases the impact of the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar 
we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
gains and losses on currency transactions are included in operating income and do impact our operating margins 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on currency translations are recorded in our consolidated financial statements as a component of other comprehensive income loss and do not impact our operating margins 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
our financial results are subject to the effect of currency fluctuations on the translation of our euro denominated debt 
as of december  and  our total euro denominated debt equaled million  million based on the december  exchange rate of and million  million based on the friday  december  exchange rate of  respectively 
a weakening or strengthening of the euro against the us dollar by would decrease or increase  respectively  by million and million in and  respectively  the us dollar equivalent of our total euro denominated debt 
gains and losses on the translation of debt denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower are included as a separate component of other income expenses in our statement of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income in our balance sheet 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a five year term and a notional amount of million that effectively convert the us dollar fixed rate debt in respect of the dollar denominated notes sold into euro fixed rate debt 
we designated this contract as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in our euro denominated operations 
in addition  we designated the remaining portion of our euro denominated debt that is recorded on our us books as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated investments as of october  euro debt of million at december   million based on the december  exchange rate of 
as a result  any foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the euro denominated debt discussed above is accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk for certain of our raw materials  such as copper and zinc 
we have not materially hedged this commodity price exposure to date
