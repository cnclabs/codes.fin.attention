item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas domestically and internationally 
we operate throughout major basins in the us including colorado s wattenberg field and piceance basin  the mid continent area of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  the san juan basin in new mexico  the gulf coast and the deepwater gulf of mexico 
we also conduct business internationally  in china  ecuador  the mediterranean sea  the north sea  west africa equatorial guinea and cameroon and in other areas 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
executive overview we are a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas 
our strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is diversified between us and international projects 
the patina merger  purchase of us exploration and sale of gulf of mexico shelf properties have allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our us asset portfolio 
the result is a company with assets and capabilities that include growing us basins coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties 
our reserve base includes both us and international sources at us and international 
we are now a larger  more diversified company with greater opportunities for both us and international growth 
was a strong year for us  both financially and operationally 
significant financial results included the following net income of million  a increase over net income  diluted earnings per share of  a increase over  cash flow provided by operating activities of billion  a increase over  and completion of a million common stock repurchase program begun in significant operational highlights included the following eight successful exploration wells drilled internationally  six offshore west africa and two in the north sea  deepwater gulf of mexico exploration success at isabela mississippi canyon block  commencement of production and continued ramp up at the dumbarton development and successful exploratory appraisal well drilled at the flyndre prospect in the uk sector of the north sea  completion of the mari b well and record natural gas sales in israel  continued success of development program in the us wattenberg field  and acquisition of approximately  net acres onshore us in the piceance basin  niobrara trend and new albany shale areas 
sale of argentina in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in argentina for a sales price of million  effective july  we expect the sale  which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals  to close in equatorial guinea hydrocarbons law effective november  the government of equatorial guinea enacted the hydrocarbons law governing petroleum operations in equatorial guinea 
the governmental agency responsible for the energy industry was given the authority to renegotiate any contract for the purpose of adapting any terms and conditions that are inconsistent with the new law 
at this time we are uncertain what economic impact this law will have on our operations in equatorial guinea 
outlook we expect crude oil and natural gas production to increase in compared to factors which may impact our expected year over year increase in production include higher sales of natural gas from the alba field in equatorial guinea  and growing production from the d j and piceance basins  where we are continuing active drilling programs  offset by natural field decline in the gulf coast area 

table of contents factors which may impact our expected production profile include potential hurricane related volume curtailments in the gulf of mexico and gulf coast areas  potential winter storm related volume curtailments in the northern region of our us operations  potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the rocky mountain area of our us operations  infrastructure development in israel  potential downtime at the methanol  lpg and or lng facilities in equatorial guinea  seasonal variations in rainfall in ecuador that affect our natural gas to power project  and timing of capital expenditures  as discussed below  which are expected to result in near term production 
budget we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately billion for approximately of the capital budget has been allocated to exploration opportunities and has been allocated to production  development and other projects 
us spending is budgeted for billion  international expenditures are budgeted for million and corporate expenditures are budgeted for million 
the budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases 
we expect that the capital budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on drilling results  commodity prices  cash flows from operations and property acquisitions and divestitures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
when alternatives exist among various accounting methods  the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the following is a discussion of the accounting policies  estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in the application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
purchase price allocation as a result of the patina merger in and the acquisition of us exploration in  we acquired assets and assumed liabilities in transactions accounted for as purchases 
in connection with a purchase business combination  the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date 
deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we made various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
we estimated future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired  and estimated future operating and development costs  to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net cash flows were discounted using a market based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the merger 
the market based weighted average cost of capital rate was subjected to additional project specific risking factors 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves  the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves were reduced by additional risk weighting factors 
estimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
while the estimates of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our cash flows  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  higher fair values assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties result in higher future depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense  which results in decreased future net earnings 
also  a higher fair value assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties  based on higher estimates of future crude oil and natural gas prices  could increase the likelihood of impairment in the event of lower commodity prices or higher operating or development costs than those originally used to determine fair value 
impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded 

table of contents goodwill as of december   the consolidated balance sheet included million of goodwill  all of which has been assigned to the us reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized to earnings but is tested  at least annually  for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we conduct the goodwill impairment test as of december of each year 
other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates 
if the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired  the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired 
the impairment assessment requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
the fair value of the us reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
under the market approach  the fair value is estimated based on selected financial metrics 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs  proved reserves  as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates  divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit  or sustained decreases in natural gas or crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods 
under the market approach  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies  comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums 
although we have based the fair value estimate on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate 
in  no goodwill impairment was recognized 
when we dispose of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business  we include goodwill associated with that business in the carrying amount of the business in order to determine the gain or loss on disposal 
the amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained 
during  we allocated million of us reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of our gulf of mexico shelf properties sold 
the amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business 
reserves all of the reserve data in this form k are estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect our dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge  which would reduce earnings 
in addition  a decline in estimates of proved reserves could trigger a goodwill impairment analysis 
oil and gas properties we account for crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting 
the alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
proved property acquisition costs are amortized to operations by the unit of production method on a property by property basis based on total proved crude oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by our engineers 
costs to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are also amortized to operations by the unit of production method on a property by property basis 
they are amortized based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves 
application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  during the periods the costs are incurred 
under the full cost method  these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of dd a expense 
in addition  under the full cost method capitalized costs are accumulated in pools on a country by country basis 
dd a is computed on a country by country basis  and capitalized costs are limited on the same basis through the application of a ceiling test 
we believe the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use in accounting for our crude oil and natural gas properties as this method is better aligned with our business strategy 
if we had used the full cost method  our financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different 

table of contents exploratory well costs in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting  the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well may be capitalized temporarily  or suspended  pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered 
we will carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and as long as we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
for certain capital intensive deepwater gulf of mexico or international projects  it may take more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability 
our ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval  the timing of which is beyond our control 
in such cases  exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing access to necessary facilities and access to such permits and approvals and believe they will be obtained 
management assesses the status of suspended exploratory well costs on a quarterly basis 
these costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if we decide not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities 
at december   the balance of property  plant and equipment included million of suspended exploratory well costs  million of which had been capitalized for a period greater than one year 
the wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work  drilling additional wells  or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells
