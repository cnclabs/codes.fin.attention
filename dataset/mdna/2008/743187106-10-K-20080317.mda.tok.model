item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
our principal programs are directed toward gastroenterology  virology and oncology 
see business overview  above 
we commenced principal operations in late  and since that time we have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
we do not currently have any commercial products 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we have been and continue to be required to address a number of technological and clinical challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of funds that we will require  or the length of time that will pass  before we receive significant revenues from sales of any of our products  if ever 
our most advanced product candidate and likeliest source of product revenue is methylnaltrexone 
see business gastroenterology relistor and business licenses progenics licenses wyeth  above 
in the area of virology  we are developing viral entry inhibitors for hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv infection  which are molecules designed to inhibit a virus ability to enter certain types of immune cells and liver cells  respectively 
see business virology pro and provax and business virology hepatitis c viral entry inhibitor  above 
we are developing therapies for prostate cancer 
see business oncology psma  above 
our psma programs are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  psma development company llc  which prior to april was a joint venture with cytogen 
although we are continuing to conduct the psma related research and development activities  we will no longer recognize revenue from psma llc 
prior to our acquisition of cytogen s interest  psma llc s intellectual property  which was equally owned by us and cytogen  was used in two research and development programs  a vaccine program and a monoclonal antibody program  both of which were in the pre clinical or early clinical phases of development 
we conducted most of the research and development for those two programs prior to the acquisition and are continuing those research and development activities and will incur all the expenses of those programs 
before any products resulting from the vaccine and the monoclonal antibody programs that were jointly under development at the date of our acquisition of cytogen s interest can be commercialized  psma llc must complete pre clinical studies and phases through clinical trials for each project and file and receive approval of new drug applications with the fda 
due to the complexities and uncertainties of scientific research and the early stage of the psma programs  the timing and costs of such further development efforts and the anticipated completion dates of those programs  if ever  cannot reliably be determined at the acquisition date 
those efforts are currently expected to require at least three years  based upon the timing of our other early stage development projects 
there can be no assurance that either of the psma programs will reach technological feasibility or that they will ever be commercially viable 
the risks associated with development and commercialization of these programs include delay or failure of basic research  failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials and market products  and patent litigation 
we discontinued our gmk melanoma vaccine program during the second quarter of an independent data monitoring committee recommended that treatment in the european based phase trial  which began in  be stopped because lack of efficacy was observed after an interim analysis 
we have subsequently terminated our license agreement with memorial sloan kettering cancer center relating to this program 
our sources of revenues through december  have been payments under our current and former collaboration agreements  from psma llc  from research grants and contracts from the national institutes of health nih related to our cancer and virology programs and from interest income 
beginning in january  we have been recognizing revenues from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for relistor as incurred  for the million upfront payment we received from wyeth over the period of our development obligations and for any milestones or contingent events that are achieved during our collaboration with wyeth 
we have not recognized revenue from psma llc for the years ended december  or  since during  prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc on april   we and cytogen had not approved a work plan and budget for and subsequently psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 

table of contents a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
during  expenses for our pro  hcv and psma research programs have increased significantly over those in and we expect that during our research and development expenses for these programs will continue to increase as our programs progress and we make filings with regulators to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates 
a portion of these expenses is reimbursed under our nih grants and contract 
our development and commercialization expenses for relistor are being funded by wyeth  which allows us to devote our current and future resources to our other research and development programs 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from a public offering totaling million shares of our common stock 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond one year 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
other than potential revenues from relistor  we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from product sales or otherwise  in the near term  and we expect our expenses to increase 
consequently  we may require significant additional external funding to continue our operations at their current levels in the future 
such funding may be derived from additional collaboration or licensing agreements with pharmaceutical or other companies or from the sale of our common stock or other securities to investors  but may also not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

we recognize a portion of the upfront payment in a reporting period in accordance with the proportionate performance method  which is based on the percentage of actual effort performed on our development obligations in that period relative to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement  as reflected in the most recent development plan and budget approved by wyeth and us 
during the third quarter of  a revised budget was approved  which extended our performance period to the end of and  thereby  decreased the amount of revenue we are recognizing in each reporting period 
reimbursement of development costs is recognized as revenue as the costs are incurred under the development plan agreed to by us and wyeth 
the milestones were recognized according to the substantive milestone method

research revenues from psma llc on april   psma llc became our wholly owned subsidiary and  accordingly  since that date we no longer recognize revenue related to research and development activities performed by us for psma llc 
during  prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc  we and cytogen had not approved a work plan and budget for and  therefore  we were not reimbursed for our research and development services to psma llc and did not recognize any revenue from psma llc in research grants and contract revenues from research grants and contract from the nih decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december    and  from grants and  and  from the contract awarded to us by the nih in september the nih contract for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in grant revenue resulted from completion of certain grants in and fewer reimbursable expenses in than in on new and continuing grants in in addition  there was increased activity under the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for the development of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
funding under the nih contract provides for pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing 
these funds are being used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
the nih contract originally provided for up to million in funding to us  subject to annual funding approvals and compliance with its terms  over five years 
the total of our approved award under the nih contract through september is million 
funding under this contract includes the payment of an aggregate of million in fees  subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including  for the achievement of two milestones 
we have recently been informed by the nih that it has decided not to fund this contract beyond september to continue to develop the hiv vaccine after that time  therefore  we will need to provide funding on our own or obtain new governmental or other funding 
if we choose not to provide our own or cannot secure governmental or other funding  we will discontinue this project

the decrease was due to the slower pace of research and development activities on the psma projects in and an increase in grant revenue recognized by the company from awards related to research and development services performed for psma llc  which effectively decreases research and development revenue from psma llc 
proceeds received from grants related to psma llc and for which we have also been compensated by psma llc for services provided were  in the period 
we have reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements adjustments to decrease both joint venture losses and contract revenue from psma llc in respect of such amounts 
research grants and contract revenues from research grants and contract from the nih increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december    and  from grants and  and  from the nih contract for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase resulted from a greater amount of work performed under the grants in the period  some of which allowed greater spending limits  including million in new grants we were awarded during  million of which was to partially fund pro program over a three and a half year period

table of contents income taxes for the years ended december  and  we had losses both for book and tax purposes 
for the year ended december   although we had a pre tax net loss of million for book purposes  we had taxable income due primarily to the million upfront payment received from wyeth and the million cash and common stock paid to ur labs and the goldberg distributees  which were treated differently for book and tax purposes 
for book purposes  payments made to ur labs and the goldberg distributees were expensed in the period the payments were made 
for tax purposes  however  the ur labs transaction was a tax free reorganization and will never result in a deduction for tax purposes and the payments to the goldberg distributees have been capitalized as an intangible license asset and will be deducted for tax purposes over a fifteen year period 
for book purposes  we deferred recognition of revenue for the million at december  and are recognizing revenue for that amount over the development period for relistor expected through the end of 
for tax purposes  since cash was received  the million was included in taxable income in we  therefore  recognized an income tax provision in for the effect of the federal and state alternative minimum tax 
we do not recognize deferred tax assets considering our history of taxable losses and the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize these deferred tax assets 
net loss our net loss was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview we have  to date  generated no meaningful amounts of product revenue  and consequently we have relied principally on external funding to finance our operations 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  public offerings of common stock  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  are sufficient to fund current operations for at least one year 
our cash flow from operating activities was negative for the years ended december   and due primarily to the excess of expenditures on our research and development programs and general and administrative costs related to those programs over cash received from collaborators and government grants and contracts to fund such programs  as described below 
sources of cash operating activities 
our current collaboration with wyeth provided us with a million upfront payment in december in addition  since january  wyeth has been reimbursing us for development expenses we incur related to relistor under the development plan agreed to between us and wyeth  which is currently expected to continue through for the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  of reimbursement of our development costs 
since inception of the collaboration agreement  wyeth has made million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain events which are specified in the collaboration agreement 
in may  we earned million of milestone payments related to the acceptance for review of applications submitted for marketing approval of a subcutaneous formulation of relistor for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients receiving palliative care in the us and the european union 
wyeth has also submitted applications for the marketing of this product in australia and canada 
in october  we earned a million milestone payment in connection with the start of a phase clinical trial of intravenous relistor for the treatment of post operative ileus 
wyeth is obligated to make up to million in additional payments to us upon the achievement of milestones and other contingent events in the development and commercialization of relistor 
wyeth is also responsible for all commercialization activities related to relistor products 
the fda review of the subcutaneous formulation of relistor is expected to be completed by its prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of april  if approval for marketing of the subcutaneous formulation of relistor for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients receiving palliative care is approved by us and or other regulatory agencies  we will receive royalty payments from wyeth as the product is sold in the respective countries 
we will also receive royalty payments upon the sale of all other products developed under the collaboration agreement 

table of contents the funding by wyeth of our development costs for relistor enables us to devote our current and future resources to our other research and development programs 
we may also enter into collaboration agreements with respect to other of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  or how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
the consummation of other collaboration agreements would further allow us to advance other projects with our current funds 
in september  we were awarded a contract by the nih to develop a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
funding under the nih contract provided for pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing 
these funds are being used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
the nih contract originally provided for up to million in funding to us  subject to annual funding approvals and compliance with its terms  over five years 
the total of our approved award under the nih contract through september is million 
funding under this contract includes the payment of an aggregate of million in fees  subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including  for the achievement of two milestones 
we have recently been informed by the nih that it has decided not to fund this contract beyond september to continue to develop the hiv vaccine after that time  therefore  we will need to provide funding on our own or obtain new government or other funding 
if we choose not to provide our own or cannot secure governmental or other funding  we will discontinue this project 
we have also been awarded grants from the nih  which provide ongoing funding for a portion of our virology and cancer research programs for periods including the years ended december   and among those grants were an aggregate of million in grants made in and  which extend over two and three year periods 
two awards were made during  which provide for up to million and million in support of our hcv research program and pro hiv development program  respectively  to be awarded over a three year and a three and a half year period  respectively 
funding under all of our nih grants is subject to compliance with their terms  and is subject to annual funding approvals 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue from all of our nih grants 
changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable for the years ended december   and resulted from the timing of receipts from the nih and payments made to trade vendors in the normal course of business 
other than amounts to be received from wyeth and from currently approved grants and contracts  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than potential revenues from relistor  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our products to the commercial marketing stage 
investing activities 
we purchase and sell marketable securities in order to provide funding for our operations and to achieve appreciation of our unused cash in a low risk environment 
our marketable securities  which include corporate debt securities  securities of government sponsored entities and auction rate securities ars  are classified as available for sale 
the ars that we purchase consist of municipal bonds with maturities greater than five years  and do not include mortgage backed instruments 
as of december   we had not experienced failed auctions of our ars due to lack of investor interest 
the majority of our marketable securities investments have short maturities and  in accordance with our investment guidelines  all have credit ratings of at least aa aa 
therefore  credit market conditions through december  did not have a material negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations or the liquidity of our marketable securities 
rather  interest rate increases during and have generally resulted in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio 
the auction process for ars historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
in the second half of  however  this process began to deteriorate 
during the first quarter of  we began to reduce the principal amount of ars in our portfolio from million at year end 
while our portfolio was not affected by the auction process deterioration in  some of the ars we hold experienced auction failures during the first quarter of as a result  when we attempted to liquidate them through auction  we were unable to do so as to approximately million principal amount  which we continue to hold 
in the event of an auction failure  the interest rate on the security is reset according to the contractual terms in the underlying indenture 
as of march   we have received all scheduled interest payments associated with these securities 

table of contents our marketable securities are purchased and  in the case of ars  sold by third party brokers in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
our brokerage account requires that all marketable securities  other than ars  be held to maturity unless authorization is obtained from us to sell earlier 
in fact  we have a history of holding all marketable securities  other than ars  to maturity 
we  therefore  consider that we have the intent and ability to hold any securities with unrealized losses until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity and we do not consider these marketable securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  and the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
we believe that any unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our financial statements 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in continuation or acceleration of the current instability in these markets and or deterioration in the ratings of our investments may affect our ability to liquidate these securities  and therefore may affect our financial condition  cash flows and earnings 
we believe that based on our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flows  financial flexibility or ability to fund our obligations 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments 
if the current market conditions continue  in which some auctions for ars fail  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record unrealized losses or impairment charges in as auctions have closed successfully  we have converted our investments in ars to money market funds 
we believe we will have the ability to hold any auction rate securities for which auctions fail until the market recovers 
we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business 
financing activities on september   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock  pursuant to a shelf registration statement that had been filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in  which had registered million shares of our common stock 
we received proceeds of million  or per share  which was net of underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million  and paid approximately million in other offering expenses 
we anticipate using the net proceeds to fund clinical trials of our product candidates and for research and development projects 
we may also use the proceeds for other corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions of technology or companies in complementary fields 
during the year ended december   we completed three public offerings of common stock  pursuant to shelf registrations covering up to million in securities issuances that we had filed with the sec in and  which provided us with a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of million shares 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for at least one of our product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies in addition to that for relistor  we will be required to fund our operations for periods in the future  by seeking additional financing through future offerings of equity or debt securities or funding from additional grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
during the years ended december   and  we received cash of million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees  directors and non employee consultants and from the sale of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
the amount of cash we receive from these sources is greater with increases in headcount and with increases in the price of our common stock on the grant date for options exercised  and on the sale date for shares sold under our employee stock purchase plans 

table of contents uses of cash operating activities 
the majority of our cash has been used to advance our research and development programs 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating gastroenterology  virology and oncology  and are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and oncology 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
under our collaboration agreement with wyeth  however  we are able to estimate that those remaining costs for the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor  based upon the development plan and budget approved by us and wyeth  which defines the totality of our obligations  are million over the period from january  to december  for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred  by project  were as follows 
expenses for relistor for include million related to our purchase of rights from relistor licensors see business licenses progenics licenses ur labs university of chicago  above for more details 
expenses for cancer for include million related to our purchase of cytogen s interest in our psma joint venture  see business oncology prostate cancer psma  above for more details for the year ended december  in millions relistor hiv cancer other programs total although we expect that our spending on relistor during will be similar to that in  our cash outlays in accordance with the agreed upon development plan will be reimbursed by wyeth 
we also expect that spending on our pro  psma and hcv programs will increase during and beyond 
consequently  we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  for the cost of product in licensing and for any possible acquisitions 
manufacturing and commercialization expenses for relistor will be funded by wyeth 
however  if we exercise our option to co promote relistor products in the us  which must be approved by wyeth  we will be required to establish and fund a sales force  which we currently do not have 
if we commercialize any other product candidate other than with a corporate collaborator  we would also require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
our purchase of rights from our methylnaltrexone licensors in december see business licenses progenics licenses ur labs university of chicago  above has extinguished our cash payments that would have been due to those licensors in the future upon the achievement of certain events  including sales of relistor products 
we continue  however  to be responsible to make payments including royalties to the university of chicago upon the occurrence of certain events 
prior to our acquisition of psma llc on april   all costs of psma llc s research and development efforts were funded equally by us and cytogen through capital contributions 
our and cytogen s level of commitment to fund psma llc was based on an annual budget that was developed and approved by the parties 
during the year ended december   we and cytogen each contributed million to fund work under the approved budget and million to fund work under the approved budget 
during  prior to our acquisition of cytogen s interest in psma llc  we and cytogen had not approved a work plan and budget for and  therefore  no further capital contributions were made by cytogen or us subsequent to december  however  we and cytogen were required to fulfill obligations under existing contractual commitments as of december  since psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary as of april   we no longer have contractual obligations to make capital contributions 
costs incurred by psma llc from january  to april  were funded from psma llc s cash reserves 
we are continuing to conduct the psma research and development projects on our own subsequent to our acquisition of psma llc and are required to fund the entire amount of such efforts  thus  increasing our cash expenditures 
we are funding psma related research and development efforts from our internally generated cash flows 
we are also continuing to receive funding from the nih for a portion of our psma related research and development costs 

table of contents investing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we have spent million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures 
those expenditures have been related to the expansion of our office  laboratory and manufacturing facilities and the purchase of more laboratory equipment for our ongoing and future research and development projects  including the purchase of a second liter bioreactor for the manufacture of research and clinical products 
during  we expect that capital expenditures will continue to the extent we lease and renovate additional laboratory  manufacturing and office space and increase headcount of our research and development and administrative staff 
contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements payments due by december  total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements total assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement  including those by psma llc 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue no

our license and co development agreement with wyeth includes a non refundable upfront license fee  reimbursement of development costs  research and development payments based upon our achievement of clinical development milestones  contingent payments based upon the achievement by wyeth of defined events and royalties on product sales 
we began recognizing research revenue from wyeth on january  during the years ended december   and  we also recognized revenue from government research grants and contracts  which are used to subsidize a portion of certain of our research projects projects  exclusively from the nih 
we also recognized revenue from the sale of research reagents during those periods 
we recognized research and development revenue exclusively from psma llc for the year ended december  non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  such as research and steering or other committee services  can be separated in accordance with eitf we would recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research or steering or other committee services  could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
we must determine the period over which our performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents will typically be used as the measure of performance 
under the proportionate performance method  revenue related to upfront license payments is recognized in any period as the percent of actual effort expended in that period relative to total effort for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
we are recognizing revenue related to the upfront license payment we received from wyeth using the proportionate performance method since we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement with wyeth based upon the most current budget approved by both wyeth and us 
such performance obligations are provided by us on a best efforts basis 
full time equivalents are being used as the measure of performance 
significant judgment is required in determining the nature and assignment of tasks to be accomplished by each of the parties and the level of effort required for us to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
the nature and assignment of tasks to be performed by each party involves the preparation  discussion and approval by the parties of a development plan and budget 
since we have no obligation to develop the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor outside the us or the oral formulation at all and have no significant commercialization obligations for any product  recognition of revenue for the upfront payment is not required during those periods  if they extend beyond the period of our development obligations 
during the course of a collaboration agreement  eg  the collaboration agreement with wyeth  that involves a development plan and budget  the amount of the upfront license payment that is recognized as revenue in any period will increase or decrease as the percentage of actual effort increases or decreases  as described above 
when a new budget is approved  generally annually  the remaining unrecognized amount of the upfront license fee will be recognized prospectively  using the methodology described above and applying any changes in the total estimated effort or period of development that is specified in the revised approved budget 
the amounts of the upfront license payment that we recognized as revenue for each fiscal quarter prior to the third quarter of were based upon several revised approved budgets  although the revisions to those budgets did not materially affect the amounts of revenue recognized in those periods 
during the third quarter of  however  the estimate of our total remaining effort to complete our development obligations was increased significantly based upon a revised development budget approved by both us and wyeth 

table of contents as a result  the period over which our obligations will extend  and over which the upfront payment will be amortized  was extended from the end of to the end of consequently  the amount of revenue recognized from the upfront payment in the second half of declined relative to that in the comparable period of due to the significant judgments involved in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement  further changes in any of those judgments are reasonably likely to occur in the future which could have a material impact on our revenue recognition 
if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an upfront payment at the time of the termination 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis  then the total upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
if we are involved in a steering or other committee as part of a multiple element arrangement  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
for those committees that are deemed obligations  we will evaluate our participation along with other obligations in the arrangement and will attribute revenue to our participation through the period of our committee responsibilities 
in relation to the collaboration agreement with wyeth  we have assessed the nature of our involvement with the joint steering  joint development and joint commercialization committees 
our involvement in the first two such committees is one of several obligations to develop the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor through regulatory approval in the us we have combined the committee obligations with the other development obligations and are accounting for these obligations during the development phase as a single unit of accounting 
after the development period  however  we have assessed the nature of our involvement with the three committees to be a right  rather than an obligation 
our assessment is based upon the fact we negotiated to be on these committees as an accommodation for our granting of the license for relistor to wyeth 
further  wyeth has been granted by us an exclusive license even as to us to the technology and know how regarding relistor and has been assigned the agreements for the manufacture of relistor by third parties 
following regulatory approval of the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor  wyeth will continue to develop the oral formulation and to commercialize all formulations  for which it is capable and responsible 
during those periods  the activities of these committees will be focused on wyeth s development and commercialization obligations 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payment is non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  iv the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and v a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment the substantive milestone method 
during october and may  we earned million and million  respectively  upon achievement of non refundable milestones anticipated in the collaboration agreement with wyeth  the first in connection with the commencement of a phase clinical trial of the intravenous formulation of relistor and the second in connection with the submission and acceptance for review of an nda for a subcutaneous formulation of relistor with the fda and a comparable submission in the european union 
we considered those milestones to be substantive based on the significant degree of risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement related to the conduct and successful completion of clinical trials and  therefore  of not achieving the milestones  the amount of the payment received relative to the significant costs incurred since inception of the collaboration agreement and amount of effort expended to achieve the milestones  and the passage of ten and seventeen months  respectively  from inception of the collaboration agreement to the achievement of those milestones 
therefore  we recognized the milestone payments as revenue in the respective periods in which the milestones were earned 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
we will recognize revenue for payments that are contingent upon performance solely by our collaborator immediately upon the achievement of the defined event if we have no related performance obligations 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s current operating budget for the wyeth collaboration agreement for our total effort required to complete our performance obligations under that arrangement 
that estimate may change in the future and such changes to estimates would be accounted for prospectively and would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
nih grant and contract revenue is recognized as efforts are expended and as related subsidized project costs are incurred 
we perform work under the nih grants and contract on a best effort basis 
the nih reimburses us for costs associated with projects in the fields of virology and cancer  including pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus  as requested by the nih 
substantive at risk milestone payments are uncommon in these arrangements  but would be recognized as revenue on the same basis as the substantive milestone method 
prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc on april   both we and cytogen were required to fund psma llc equally to support ongoing research and development efforts that we conducted on behalf of psma llc 
we recognized payments for research and development as revenue as services were performed 
during the quarter ended march   however  we and cytogen had not approved a work plan or budget for beginning on january   therefore  we had not been reimbursed by psma llc for our services and we did not recognize revenue from psma llc for the quarter ended march  beginning in the second quarter of  psma llc became our wholly owned subsidiary and  accordingly  we no longer recognize revenue from psma llc

the cumulative effect of adjustments upon adoption of sfas no 
r was not material

compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of awards that are expected to vest 
as of december   there was million  million and  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options under the plans  the nonvested shares and the purchase plans  respectively 
those costs are expected to be recognized over weighted average periods of years  years and years  respectively 

table of contents we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
we have made an accounting policy decision to use the straight line method of attribution of compensation expense  under which the grant date fair value of share based awards will be recognized on a straight line basis over the total requisite service period for the total award 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires input assumptions of stock price on the date of grant  exercise price  volatility  expected term  dividend rate and risk free interest rate 
we use the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  as quoted on the nasdaq stock market llc  as the exercise price 
historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since it provides the most reliable indication of future volatility 
future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation method  historical data is available for the length of the option s expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 
for the years ended december   and  the volatility of our common stock has been high   and  respectively  which is common for entities in the biotechnology industry that do not have commercial products 
a higher volatility input to the black scholes model increases the resulting compensation expense 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
for the year ended december   our expected term was calculated based upon historical data related to exercise and post termination cancellation activity for each of two groups of recipients of stock options employees  and officers and directors 
accordingly  for grants made to each of the groups mentioned above  we are using expected terms of and years  respectively 
expected term for options granted to non employee consultants was ten years  which is the contractual term of those options 
for the year ended december   our expected term was calculated based upon the simplified method as detailed in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
accordingly  we used an expected term of years based upon the vesting period of the outstanding options of four or five years and a contractual term of ten years 
for the year ended december   our expected term of years was based upon the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term 
a shorter expected term would result in a lower compensation expense 
we have never paid dividends and do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
therefore  our dividend rate is zero 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
a portion of the options granted to our chief executive officer on july    and  on july  and on july  cliff vests after nine years and eleven months from the respective grant date 
vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
in the case of the executive s options  the explicit service period is nine years and eleven months from the respective grant dates 
the implied service periods related to the performance conditions are the estimated times for each performance condition to be achieved 
thus  compensation expense will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of performance conditions for that award assuming that the performance conditions will be achieved before the cliff vesting occurs 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
the fair value of shares purchased under the purchase plans was estimated on the date of grant in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option 
the same option valuation model was used for the purchase plans as for non qualified stock options  except that the expected term for the purchase plans is six months and the historical volatility is calculated over the six month expected term 

table of contents in applying the treasury stock method for the calculation of diluted earnings per share eps  amounts of unrecognized compensation expense and windfall tax benefits are required to be included in the assumed proceeds in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation unless they are anti dilutive 
we incurred a net loss for the years ended december   and  and  therefore  such amounts have not been included for those periods in the calculation of diluted eps since they would be anti dilutive 
accordingly  basic and diluted eps are the same for those periods 
we have made an accounting policy decision to calculate windfall tax benefits shortfalls for purposes of diluted eps calculations  excluding the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets 
this policy decision will apply when we have net income 
research and development expenses including clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of subjects in the trial  the rate at which the subjects enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our collaboration agreement with wyeth regarding relistor in which wyeth has assumed all of the financial responsibility for further development will mitigate those costs 
in addition to clinical trial expenses  we estimate the amounts of other research and development expenses  for which invoices have not been received at the end of a period  based upon communication with third parties that have provided services or goods during the period 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on september   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
fas does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under fas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
fas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fas requires disclosures intended to provide information about i the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  ii the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and iii the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
we adopted fas on january  for all financial assets and liabilities and recurring non financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value 
adoption of fas for all non recurring non financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value such as in the determination of impairment of fixed assets or goodwill will occur on january  we do not expect the impact of the adoption of fas to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the objective of fas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the impact of the adoption of fas to be material to our financial position or results of operations since we do not currently have any financial assets or liabilities that are subject to fas the emerging issues task force reached a final consensus on issue eitf accounting for collaborative arrangements 
this issue affects entities that have entered into arrangements which are not conducted through a separate legal entity 
the task force reached a conclusion that a collaborative arrangement is within the scope of eitf if i the parties are active participants in the arrangement and ii the participants are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the endeavor s ultimate commercial success 
the task force also reached a conclusion that transactions with third parties ie  revenue generated and costs incurred by the partners should be reported in the appropriate line item in each company s financial statement pursuant to the guidance in eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent or other applicable generally acceptable accounting principle applied consistently 
the task force also concluded that the equity method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  should not be applied to arrangements that are not conducted through a separate legal entity 
the guidance in eitf will be effective for periods that begin after december  and be accounted for as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application 
we do not expect the impact of the adoption of eitf to be a material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents on september   the fasb reached a final consensus on emerging issues task force issue eitf accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
currently  under fasb statement no 
 accounting for research and development costs  non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities for materials  equipment  facilities and purchased intangible assets that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
eitf addresses whether such non refundable advance payments for goods or services that have no alternative future use and that will be used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payments are made or when the research and development activities have been performed 
the consensus reached by the fasb requires companies involved in research and development activities to capitalize such non refundable advance payments for goods and services pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement because the right to receive those services in the future represents a probable future economic benefit 
those advance payments will be capitalized and expensed as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities will be required to evaluate whether they expect the goods or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment will be charged to expense 
the consensus on eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
entities are required to recognize the effects of applying the guidance in eitf prospectively for new contracts entered into after the effective date

r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions  as specified 
that replaces sfas no 
s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
among the amendments that sfas no 
r makes to existing authoritative guidance  it supersedes fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their acquisition date fair values and then immediately charged to expense 
under sfas no 
r  the acquirer will recognize separately from goodwill the acquisition date fair values of research and development assets acquired in a business combination as long lived intangible assets 
those assets are subject to testing for impairment  such as completion or abandonment of an acquired research project  at which time the impaired asset will be expensed 
sfas no 
r provides guidance on the impairment testing of acquired research and development intangible assets and assets that the acquirer intends not to use 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal years beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply it before that date 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in the event that we enter into a business combination that falls within the scope of this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
a noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
sfas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
before sfas no 
was issued  limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling interests  which were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require a the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity  b the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  c changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently  d when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value  e the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment and f entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
if there are noncontrolling interests in future business combinations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing our risk 
our investments consist of taxable ars  corporate notes and issues of government sponsored entities 
our investments totaled million at december  approximately million of these investments had fixed interest rates  and million had interest rates that were variable 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our fixed interest rate long term investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the investment 
a basis point increase in the december  market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in the market values of these investments 
at december   we did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments 
our marketable securities  which include corporate debt securities  securities of government sponsored entities and auction rate securities ars  are classified as available for sale 
the ars that we purchase consist of municipal bonds with maturities greater than five years and  in accordance with our investment guidelines  have credit ratings of at least aa aa  and do not include mortgage backed instruments 
as of december   we had not experienced failed auctions of our ars due to lack of investor interest 
the auction process for ars historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
in the second half of  however  this process began to deteriorate 
during the first quarter of  we began to reduce the principal amount of ars in our portfolio from million at year end 
while our portfolio was not affected by the auction process deterioration in  some of the ars we hold experienced auction failures during the first quarter of as a result  when we attempted to liquidate them through auction  we were unable to do so as to approximately million principal amount  which we continue to hold 
in the event of an auction failure  the interest rate on the security is reset according to the contractual terms in the underlying indenture 
as of march   we have received all scheduled interest payments associated with these securities 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
we believe that any unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our financial statements 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in continuation or acceleration of the current instability in these markets and or deterioration in the ratings of our investments may affect our ability to liquidate these securities  and therefore may affect our financial condition  cash flows and earnings 
we believe that based on our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flows  financial flexibility or ability to fund our obligations 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments 
if the current market conditions continue  in which some auctions for ars fail  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record unrealized losses or impairment charges in as auctions have closed successfully  we have converted our investments in ars to money market funds 
we believe we will have the ability to hold any auction rate securities for which auctions fail until the market recovers 
we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business
