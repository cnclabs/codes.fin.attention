financial summary the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill restructuring costs  net in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss total net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  broken down by business unit  compared to  professional video revenues increased  audio revenues increased  primarily due to our july acquisition of sibelius  and consumer video revenues decreased 
the revenues of each business unit are discussed in further detail in the section titled results of operations below 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for includes million of acquisition related costs for intangible asset amortization expenses  compared to million of acquisition related costs in  including intangible asset amortization expenses of million  a goodwill impairment charge of million and in process research and development expenses of million 
this decrease in acquisition related costs was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses and to a lesser extent from slightly decreased gross margins 
to address our increasing operating expenses  we announced restructuring programs in the third quarter of  primarily in our professional video and consumer video segments  that are meant to improve operational efficiencies and align key business skill sets with future opportunities 
during we recorded restructuring charges of million related to these programs 
following an in depth internal analysis and with the assistance of bain and company  we have identified a number of initiatives that focus on operational efficiency and strategic analysis and improvements 
we have undertaken  or plan to undertake  many of these initiatives and expect to make significant investments in these initiatives in the costs for the bain and company consulting arrangement were million 
our operating activities continue to generate positive cash flows with cash of million provided by operating activities in  compared to million in our cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflected non cash adjustments to our net loss for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  as well as a decrease in inventory and an increase in deferred revenues 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
international sales accounted for of our net revenues in  compared to of our net revenues for both and our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency could materially impact  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting transaction and remeasurement gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant percentage of our sales transactions are completed during the final weeks or days of each quarter  and  therefore  we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate effect on our overall earnings 
see item a risk factors for additional risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  allowances for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions  the valuation of inventories  business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenues from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
in addition  for certain transactions where our services are non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenues upon satisfying the criteria of sop and obtaining customer acceptance 
within our professional video segment  much of our audio segment and our consumer video segment  we follow the guidance of sop for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenues based on satisfying the criteria in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in connection with many of our product sale transactions  customers may purchase a maintenance and support agreement 
we recognize revenues from maintenance contracts on a ratable basis over their term 
we recognize revenues from training  installation or other services as the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically professional services or maintenance  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  in certain transactions  fair value of maintenance is based on the renewal price that is offered as a contractual right to the customer  provided that such renewal price is substantive 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our fair value for such services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
in most cases  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  certain transactions  typically those involving orders from end users  such as news broadcasters  for a significant number of products for a single customer site require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenues for either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if these orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenues are recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
telephone support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenues ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  and provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence regarding the fair value of the undelivered element  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize that revenue only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our professional video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  distributors of our media composer software  avid xpress pro and avid mojo products have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in contrast  some channel partners  particularly our audio and certain of our consumer video channel partners  are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
the amount and timing of our revenues for any period may be impacted if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenues from sales of consumer video products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenues for these channel partners is recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
from time to time  we offer rebates on purchases of certain products or based on purchasing volume that are accounted for as reductions to revenues upon shipment or expected achievement of purchasing volumes 
in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  consideration given to customers or resellers under the rebate program is recorded as a reduction to revenues because we do not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from the sale of our products 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenues are recognized only if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur in a timely manner 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not reasonably assured based on our credit review process  revenues are recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of sop and sab no 
are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we record as revenues all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs and record the actual shipping costs as a component of cost of revenues 
we record reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues  with related costs recorded as cost of revenues 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to a government authority 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of  and started to account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  or sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires employee stock based compensation awards to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method as permitted under sfas r 
under this method  we are required to record compensation cost  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r  for stock based awards granted after the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards  which generally equals the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the non vested portion of previously granted stock based awards outstanding at the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
adjusted for forfeitures as required by sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for options issued to employees and non employee directors in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
in connection with our acquisition of m audio in august  we assumed options to certain m audio employees at exercise prices that were less than the market price of our common stock at the date of acquisition 
we recorded as deferred compensation a portion of the difference between the exercise prices and the fair value of the options at the date of completion of the acquisition  determined under the black scholes method  multiplied by the number of shares underlying the options 
the resulting deferred compensation was expensed over the vesting period of the options 
additionally  deferred compensation was recorded for restricted stock granted to employees based on the market price of our common stock at the date of grant  which was being expensed over the period in which the restrictions lapse 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r on january   we reversed the remaining deferred compensation of million  with the offset to additional paid in capital 
on october   in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r  our board of directors approved a partial acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding options to purchase our common stock that were granted on february  vesting was accelerated for options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  including options to purchase  shares of our common stock held by our executive officers 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to avoid recognizing compensation cost related to these out of the money options in our future statements of operations upon the adoption of sfas r 
it is estimated that the maximum future compensation expense that would have been recorded in our statements of operations had the vesting of these options not been accelerated is approximately million 
the fair values of restricted stock awards  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
and sfas r  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
since adoption of sfas r on january   the expected stock price volatility assumption used by us has been based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
prior to adoption of sfas r  the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
based on our historical turnover rates  an annualized estimated forfeiture rate of was used in calculating the estimated compensation cost of most of the stock based awards for the year ended december  and all of the stock based awards for the year ended december  in december  we granted a stock option to purchase  shares of our common stock and  shares of restricted stock award to our newly hired chief executive officer 
the compensation cost for these grants was estimated using a forfeiture rate 
additional expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rates are lower than estimated  and a recovery of prior expense will be recorded if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  forfeitures were not estimated at the time of award 
the stock option to purchase  shares granted to our chief executive officer in december included  shares that vest based on performance and market conditions 
the vesting of  shares is tied to our stock price 
the vesting of the remaining  shares is tied to both our stock price and improvements in our return on equity 
the fair value of these options was determined using the monte carlo valuation method 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and monte carlo models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
see footnote l to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
during we granted both restricted stock units and stock options as part of our annual stock based compensation program  and during we granted only restricted stock units as part of this program 
during both and  we granted stock options to new hires and restricted stock to newly hired executives 
the vesting of stock option grants may be based on time  performance or market conditions 
in the future  we may grant either stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party lease financing options to some of our customers 
we are not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
we record revenues from these transactions upon the shipment of our products because we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated these programs for over ten years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participate in the program could require additional reserves 
see footnote j to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding third party lease financing 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability based on assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price of the acquired businesses to the assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other such circumstances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure is based on strategic business units aligned with the principal markets in which our products are sold professional video  audio and consumer video 
our reporting units equate to these strategic business units 
all three of the reporting units include goodwill 
we complete our annual impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
in our goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our reporting units 
this model focuses on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit and also assumes a terminal value for the unit based on a multiple of revenue 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
for reporting units composed primarily of acquired businesses  we utilize the same technique as was used to value the acquisition assuming it is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  our impairment testing determined that the carrying value of our consumer video reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the fair value of the consumer video unit was based on a multiple of revenues technique similar to that used in valuing the pinnacle acquisition  updated for current revenues projections 
the estimated fair value was then allocated among the assets and liabilities of the consumer video business  with the excess fair value representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
because the book value of consumer video s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss 
in our identifiable intangible asset impairment analysis  if events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in connection with the goodwill impairment charge taken for the consumer video reporting unit in  we also reviewed the consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities in the consumer video business that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing  because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within our company 
the result of this analysis was that the undiscounted cash flows of the consumer video net asset groups exceeded the carrying value  indicating no impairment loss had occurred 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes compared to the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability with consideration for such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets as of december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  a million non cash reduction in income tax expense and a million credit to goodwill related to pinnacle net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences would be recorded 
to the extent some or all of our valuation allowance is reversed  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
for there was no impact to goodwill from the utilization of acquired us deferred tax assets 
for the impact to goodwill resulting from the utilization of acquired us deferred tax assets was million 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas r  recognition of these assets would occur upon their utilization to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
as a result of the exercise of employee stock options  we recorded increases to additional paid in capital of million and million in and  respectively 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statement in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained before being recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation also requires us to accrue interest and penalties as applicable on our unrecognized tax positions 
we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the adoption of fin results of operations in the first quarter of  with the adoption of sfas r  we began to record stock based compensation expense for the fair value of stock options 
stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  resulting from the adoption of sfas r  the acquisition of m audio and the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units  was included in the following in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively years ended december  in thousands product cost of revenues service cost of revenues research and development expenses marketing and selling expenses general and administrative expenses in addition  stock based compensation totaling  was included in the caption restructuring costs  net during related to stock based compensation expense for the acceleration of vesting for certain employees who were terminated in a restructuring program 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost  before forfeitures  related to non vested stock based compensation awards granted under our stock based compensation plans 
this cost will be recognized over the next four years 
we expect this cost to be amortized as follows million in  million in  million in and million thereafter

the decrease in product revenues for our video and film editing products was partially due to media composer adrenaline migration issues that caused longer than expected customer transitions to the latest versions of that product  as well as a shift in product mix to a software only version of our media composer product that has significantly lower average selling prices than our other editing products 
the decrease in revenues for our broadcast products was related to our transmission server product line 
as part of our restructuring programs  we made a decision to exit this product line 
the overall decrease in professional video product revenues for  as compared to  was partially mitigated by increased revenues from our storage and workgroups product families 
professional video service revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  professional and installation services  and training 
the million increase in service revenues for  as compared to  was due to increased revenues generated from maintenance contracts sold in connection with our products 
of the total million increase in our audio segment product revenues in  as compared to  approximately million related to our acquisition of sibelius in july audio product revenues for also included increased revenues from digidesign products  including the venue live sound mixing consoles  pro tools systems  and icon control surfaces  partially offset by a slight decrease in m audio product revenues 
the overall increase in audio segment product revenues was primarily the result of increased sales volumes 
consumer video product revenues decreased million from to  primarily due to decreased revenues from our tv over pc viewing products 
revenues from our tv over pc viewing products were lower in because of the lack of revenue drivers that existed in  such as new product releases and increased consumer demand due to the world cup tournament 
the decrease in revenues from our tv over pc viewing products was partially offset by increased revenues from our video editing products  which was primarily related to our release of pinnacle studio version in may these changes in revenues were primarily related to changes in sales volumes 
overall  net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for compared to for the decrease in indirect sales resulted from increased direct sales of our professional video products 
revenues from direct sales of our professional video products can vary significantly based on the relative proportion of revenues recognized from large solution sales in any period

professional video product revenues increased million from to for  products we acquired in the pinnacle acquisition accounted for million of professional video product revenues  compared to million for the increase in these product revenues was offset by a net decrease of million for all other product families  including decreased revenues from our video and film editing products and broadcast products 
the decrease in revenues was due to lower revenues from large solution sales as a result of several factors  including the increasing size and complexity of our customer projects  delays in delivering specific customer commitments and customer logistics delays  including changes to on air dates 
these decreased revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from our storage and workgroups products  primarily related to new product introductions 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance contracts  installation services and training 
professional video service revenues resulting from the pinnacle acquisition were million and million for and  respectively 
the remaining increase of million in  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in maintenance contracts sold in connection with our products  as well as increased revenues generated from professional services  such as installation services provided in connection with large broadcast news deals 
of the total million increase in our audio segment product revenues in  as compared to  approximately million related to our acquisition of sibelius in july the remaining increase represented increased revenues from both our m audio family of products and our digidesign products 
sales of digidesign s pro tools hd systems slowed in the third quarter of due to a transition to the intel based macintosh platform  but improved in the fourth quarter  resulting in an overall increase in these revenues from to we believe that customers delayed their pro tools hd purchases pending evaluation of the new mac pro desktop computers and a new version of pro tools software designed to support the new computers  as well as a lack of updated third party software plug in products that supported the new machines 
the consumer video segment was formed during the third quarter of with our acquisition of pinnacle  and  therefore  revenues for this segment for and are not comparable 
net revenues  which are primarily derived from our home video editing and tv over pc viewing product lines  were lower than expected for  due in large part to product quality issues in our home video editing product line 
we focused on several operating initiatives during to address the product reliability issues and improve the operating efficiency of the business 
revenues for our home video editing product line increased steadily during the third and fourth quarters of  which we believe resulted from improvements that we made to the pinnacle studio product  including our release of the pinnacle studio anniversary edition in europe during the third quarter of revenues from our tv over pc viewing products were particularly strong during the second and fourth quarters of we believe the second quarter was strong as a result of new tv over pc viewing product releases across europe and increased consumer demand during the world cup tournament 
increased sales in the fourth quarter were the result of the release of the pinnacle pctv hd pro stick in the united states in the third quarter coupled with strong holiday sales in the fourth quarter 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for compared to for the increase in indirect selling was due primarily to the acquisition of pinnacle  which sells products almost exclusively through indirect channels  and the growth in revenues from our audio segment  which also sells a large percentage of products through indirect channels 
sales to international customers accounted for of our net revenues for both and international sales increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in international sales in occurred primarily in europe  and to a lesser extent in asia  and is primarily due to the acquisition of pinnacle  which has a significant portion of its sales in europe and asia 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenues and other services  and royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products

these negative influences on gross margin were partially offset by a shift in product mix to increased revenues from higher margin software products and increased sales volumes 
during a few large professional video broadcast installations had gross margins that were lower than our usual margin for broadcast transactions of similar size  due in part to the inclusion of a high percentage of lower margin third party products 
these transactions had a negative effect on our professional video product gross margins for in our consumer video segment  we made a decision in the fourth quarter of to discontinue a tv over pc viewing product sold exclusively to an original equipment manufacturer 
this decision resulted in a write off of million in inventory and had a negative impact on the consumer video segment s gross margins

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets result from acquisitions and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
with the exception of developed technology  these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful life of the developed technology  and the straight line method over each developed technology s remaining useful life

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as part of the purchase accounting allocation for our august acquisition of pinnacle  we recorded goodwill of approximately million of which approximately million was allocated to our consumer video segment 
in december  the goodwill allocated to the consumer video reporting unit was analyzed in accordance with sfas no 
and was determined to be impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended december  see footnote g to our consolidated financial statements in item restructuring costs  net during we implemented restructuring programs within our professional video and consumer video segments  as well as corporate operations  that resulted in restructuring charges of million 
in connection with these actions  we notified approximately employees that their employment would be terminated 
the terminated employees were primarily from the research and development teams and marketing and selling teams 
the charges for the estimated costs for the employee terminations totaled million 
actions under these restructuring programs also included the closure of facilities in munich  germany and chicago  illinois and portions of facilities in tewksbury  massachusetts  montreal  canada  and mountain view  california  and our exit from the transmission server product line 
the costs for the facility closures totaled million 
as a result of exiting the transmission server product line  we recorded non cash charges totaling million in cost of revenues for the write down of inventory 
we also recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million related to the disposal of fixed assets 
the purpose of these restructuring programs was to eliminate duplicative business functions  improve operational efficiencies and align key business skill sets with future opportunities 
we expect annual cost savings of between million and million to result from actions taken under these restructuring programs 
during we also recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively  as a result of our increased estimates for the facilities restructuring costs related to our pinnacle and medea acquisitions  and million primarily as a result of our increased estimate for the restructuring costs associated with the vacated portion of our montreal facility that was part of a restructuring that took place in december the revised estimate related to the pinnacle acquisition was primarily the result of an increase in the estimated costs for the closure of pinnacle s uxbridge  uk facility based on our conclusion that we will be unable to find a subtenant at any time during the remaining term of our lease for that facility 
the revised estimate related to the montreal facility was primarily the result of a buy out of the lease for the vacated portion of the facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented restructuring programs within both our professional video and consumer video segments  resulting in restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
as a result of the professional video restructuring program  approximately employees worldwide  primarily in the management and selling teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated and a small leased office in australia was closed 
the total estimated costs for the employee terminations were million and the total costs for the facility closure were million 
as a result of the consumer video restructuring program  approximately employees worldwide  primarily in the selling and engineering teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated and a portion of a leased facility in germany was vacated 
the total estimated costs for the employee terminations were million and the total costs for the facility closure were million 
the purpose of these programs was to improve the effectiveness of each segment 
during the first and second quarters of  we recorded in our statement of operations additional restructuring charges totaling million for revisions to the estimated liabilities for the professional video restructuring program 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring program within our consumer video segment under which approximately employees worldwide  primarily in the marketing and selling teams and research and development teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the purpose of the program was to improve efficiency 
in connection with this action  we recorded a charge of million in the statement of operations for the three months ended march  during the three months ended september   we completed the payments under this restructuring and reversed approximately million remaining in the related restructuring accrual 
also during  we executed an amendment to the existing lease for our daly city  california facility that extended the lease through september  and a new subtenant was found for a portion of our london  uk facility vacated as part of a restructuring program 
based on the new terms of the amended lease for the daly city facility and our changing facilities requirements  we determined that we would re occupy the space in this facility that had previously been vacated under a restructuring program 
accordingly  the existing restructuring accrual for that facility was reversed during the three months ended september   and a restructuring recovery of million was recorded in our statement of operations 
as a result of finding a subtenant for the london facility  a restructuring recovery of million was recorded in our statement of operations during the three months ended december  in december  we implemented a restructuring program within our professional video segment under which approximately employees worldwide were terminated and a portion of a leased facility in montreal  canada was vacated 
in connection with these actions  we recorded charges of million for employment terminations and million for facilities costs 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  primarily as a result of our increased estimate for the restructuring costs associated with our london facility that was vacated as part of a restructuring plan in the revision became necessary when one of the subtenants in the facility gave notice of their intention to discontinue their sublease 
in process research and development we recorded in process r d charges of million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of sibelius  million in the first quarter of related to the acquisition of medea  million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of pinnacle  and million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of wizoo 
these in process r d charges represent product development efforts that were under way at sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo at the time of the respective acquisitions for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met detailed program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
as of the respective acquisition dates  sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo had not completed product designs or working models for the in process technology  and we determined that there was no future alternative use for the technologies beyond the stated purpose of the specific r d projects 
the fair value of each in process r d effort was  therefore  expensed at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the key assumptions used in the in process r d valuations consisted of the expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenues and expense projections assuming future release of the product  and a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks such as delays or uncertainties in bringing the products to market and competitive pressures 
such risks vary from acquisition to acquisition based on the characteristics of the acquired company and the applications of the acquired technology 
projections of revenues and expenses  the estimated costs to complete the projects and the determination of the appropriate discount rate reflect management s best estimates of such factors at the time of the valuation 
for purposes of valuing the in process r d of sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo  we used discount rates of   and  respectively

our effective tax rate  which is our tax provision as a percentage of profit or loss before tax  was  and  respectively  for  and although there was a significant decrease in the provision for income taxes in  there was a slight increase in the effective tax rate in  as compared to the decrease in the provision for income taxes in  as compared to  resulted primarily from a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the favorable settlement of a canadian r d credit audit  a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the release of a deferred tax liability in our german entity  and our inability to recognize a tax benefit on us losses 
the increase in the effective tax rate for  as compared to  resulted from a non deductible impairment of goodwill charge and an increase in deferred taxes related to the utilization of acquired net operating losses and acquired timing differences  partially offset by a reduction in tax contingency reserves 
we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from acquisition related amortization 
except for a minimal amount of state tax payments  the federal and state tax provisions are non cash provisions due to the tax impact of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option deductions and acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent there is a reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are all used to reduce current taxes payable 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible impairment of goodwill expenses  and non deductible acquisition related expenses 
we file in multiple tax jurisdictions and from time to time are subject to audit in certain tax jurisdictions  but we believe that we are adequately reserved for these exposures

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days at december   compared to days at december  the days sales outstanding at december  was unusually low due to the recognition of revenues in the fourth quarter of from a number of large broadcast deals for which payment had already been received 
at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spare parts and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
the decrease in inventory of million from december  to december  was the result of various operating initiatives  as well as approximately million related to the write off of inventories for discontinued products 
the initiatives were launched in response to significant increases in our inventories in as a result of these initiatives  we increased utilization of outsourced manufacturing programs in asia and focused on reducing our inventories through improved procurement and manufacturing forecasting

in connection with non acquisition related restructuring activities during and prior periods  as of december   we have future cash obligations of approximately million under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities  and restructuring accruals of million and million related to severance and lease obligations  respectively 
the lease accrual represents the excess of our lease commitments on space no longer used by us over expected payments to be received on subleases of such facilities 
severance payments will be made during the next twelve months 
lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations 
all payments related to restructuring actions are expected to be funded through working capital 
see footnote n to our consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as our growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses or technologies and obligations under restructuring programs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so or that we could do so on favorable terms

through a third party  we offer lease financing options to our customers 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
as of december   our maximum exposure under this program was million 
we have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on this lease  the landlord would be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum  as of december   of million 
the letter of credit will remain in effect at this amount throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september as of december   we were not in default of this lease 
we conduct our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange exposures of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions and net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and japanese yen  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward contracts were included in results of operations  offset by million of net transaction and remeasurement gains on the related assets and liabilities 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term corporate obligations  asset backed securities and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturities
