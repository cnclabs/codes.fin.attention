our business we develop  produce  market and distribute premium or new age beverages 
we currently produce  market and distribute six beverage brands jones pure cane soda  a premium soda  jones c  an enhanced water beverage  jones organics  a ready to drink organic tea  jones energy  a citrus energy drink  whoopass  a citrus energy drink  and jones naturals  a non carbonated juice tea we currently sell and distribute our products throughout the united states and canada through our network of independent distributors  which we refer to as our direct store delivery channel dsd  and our national retail accounts  which we refer to as our direct to retail channel dtr  as well as through licensing and distribution arrangements 

table of contents in  we entered the carbonated soft drink market csd with the introduction of ounce cans of jones pure cane soda  which are manufactured and distributed by national beverage corp 
in grocery and mass merchant channels in the us pursuant to an exclusive agreement we entered into with national beverage in september through this arrangement  we identify and secure retailers across the united states for our premium carbonated ounce soft drinks and ounce energy drink products  and we are responsible for all sales efforts  marketing  advertising and promotion 
using concentrate supplied by jones  national beverage both manufactures and sells on an exclusive basis the products directly to retailers 
national beverage is responsible for the manufacturing  delivery and invoicing of the sales of our products in this channel 
with respect to our dsd channel  we have focused our sales and marketing resources on the expansion and penetration of our products through our independent distributor network in our core markets consisting of the northwest  southwest and midwest us and western canada  as well as targeted expansion into our less penetrated markets consisting of the northeast and southeast us and eastern canada 
we launched our dtr business strategy in as a complementary channel of distribution to our dsd channel  targeting large national retail accounts 
through these programs  we negotiate directly with large national retailers  primarily premier food service based businesses  to carry our products  serviced through the retailer s appointed distribution system 
we currently have distribution arrangements with barnes noble  panera bread company  target corporation  sam s club and wal mart stores  inc beginning in  we launched our licensing business strategy as a method to extend our brand into non alternative beverage products and non beverage products 
we currently have licensing arrangements with two companies big sky brands  inc and j j snack foods 
with these licensing agreements  we believe that we are able to partner with companies that can manufacture jones related products and extend our jones brand into select products that we feel enhance our brand image 
we do not expect this business to be a material part of our operations in critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  but not limited to  among others  those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the salability of inventory  the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  stock based compensation expense  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and liabilities and contingencies 
the brief discussion below is intended to highlight some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below some of our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
with respect to our dsd and dtr channels  our products are sold on various terms for cash or credit 
our credit terms  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices  typically require payment within days of delivery 
we recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors and retail customers in accordance with written sales terms  net of provisions for discounts and allowances 
all sales to distributors and customers are final sales and we have a no return policy  however  in limited instances  due to credit issues  or product quality issues  we may take back product 
with respect to our csd channel  we recognize revenue from the sale of concentrate to national beverage corp 
on a gross basis and recognize income upon receipt of concentrate by national beverage 
the selling price and terms of sale of concentrate to national beverage are determined in accordance with our manufacturing and distribution agreement with them 
our credit terms from the sale of concentrate typically require payment within days of delivery 
all sales of concentrate to national beverage are final sales and we have a no return policy with them  however  in limited instances  due to product quality or other custom package commitments  we may take back product 
licensing revenue is recorded when we receive a sale confirmation from the third party 
we pay for slotting fees or similar arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
generally  this incentive is recognized as a reduction in revenue at the later of the date on which the related revenue is recognized or a commitment is made 
if we receive a benefit from any such incentives over a period of time and we meet certain other criteria  such as retailer performance  recoverability and enforceability  such incentives are recorded as an asset and are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the arrangement 
typically  we amortize slotting fees over a period of months 
we evaluate the recoverability of any deferred slotting fees on a quarterly basis 
cash consideration and promotion allowances including slotting fees that we pay to customers or distributors are accounted for as a reduction of revenue when expensed or amortized in our statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  our revenue was reduced by  and  respectively  on account of cash considerations  slotting fees  and promotion allowances 
we entered into sponsorship agreements with football northwest llc d b a seattle seahawks and first goal  inc on may  and brooklyn arena llc and new jersey nets basketball  llc on november  that provide us with the exclusive beverage rights for certain soft drinks as well as signage  advertising and other promotional benefits to enhance our brand awareness 
we have allocated amounts under the agreements to the identifiable benefits including signage  advertising and other promotional benefits based on their fair value and are recognizing such costs in promotion and selling expenses based on our existing policy for such expenses 
the remaining amounts due under the agreement in excess of the fair value of the identifiable benefits  if any  are recorded as an expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts  bad debt expense management routinely estimates the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in general  we have historically  and continue today  to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to of any unpaid balance outstanding greater than days since invoice  unless considered 
table of contents collectible 
we believe that  in general  bad debt reserves for other companies in the beverage industry represent approximately of total sales 
historically  our bad debt reserve has represented approximately of total sales 
bad debt expense is classified within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  if we receive notice of a disputed receivable balance  we accrue such additional amount as management determines is reflective of the risk of non collection 
in considering the amount of bad debt allowance  we rely heavily on our history of no material write offs and that our revenue is not dependent on one or a few customers  but is spread among a number of customers 
however  other factors which could cause management to change its estimates would be a downturn in the economy that management determines has the potential to affect collections if we see a greater concentration of our receivables from fewer customers 
in such events  we may be required to record additional charges to cover this exposure 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
inventory we hold raw materials and finished goods inventories  which are manufactured and procured based on our sales forecasts 
we value inventory at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value  and include adjustments for estimated obsolescence  on a first in first out basis 
these valuations are subject to customer acceptance and demand for the particular products  and our estimates of future realizable values based on these forecasted demands 
we regularly review inventory detail to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
differences could result in the amount and timing of write downs for any period if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
we also determine an allowance for obsolescence based on products that are over months from production date 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions and write downs of approximately  as we discontinued the production of high fructose corn syrup inventory and discontinued the sales of ounce jones soda cans and various other special packs 
at december  and  we had an inventory obsolescence provision of  and  respectively 
deferred income taxes the determination of our provision of income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of deferred tax assets 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
prior to the second quarter of  we maintained a valuation allowance for all of the us and foreign deferred taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes due to the uncertainty regarding the full utilization of our deferred tax asset 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was appropriate to record a charge of approximately  to establish a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits arising from losses in our u 
s operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced significant losses due to lower margins and the recording charges such as severance costs  promotions  slotting fee costs  inventory provisions for discontinued product and legal and professional fees which negatively impacted us pretax income and caused the company to be in the position as of december  of having cumulative losses in 
table of contents recent years with respect to our us operations 
although we do not expect to incur some of these costs in future years  we do not know yet if these investments are an aberration and the success of our incremental investments in the business remains unknown 
in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance  we considered future projections of us pretax income as a material factor in our analysis of the realizability of our net us deferred tax assets  however  it was difficult to overcome the cumulative loss 
the negative events mentioned above  while not necessarily recurring in nature and maybe beneficial to our long term future prospects  were material to our decision to establish a full valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets 
this is due to the fact that the relevant accounting guidance puts more weight on the negative objective evidence of cumulative losses in recent years than the positive subjective evidence of future projections of pretax income 
we continually analyze the realizability of our deferred tax assets  but reasonably expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved us operations and tax planning strategies 
no valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets recorded in the canadian subsidiary  as this subsidiary remains profitable 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin on january  the adoption of fin did not impact the consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded for the year ended december  pursuant to fin contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
see item legal proceedings 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge to operations for estimated costs of adjudication or settlement and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
as of december   no loss contingencies have been accrued for any class action or derivative lawsuits  as we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases 
an adverse court determination in any of these actions against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition  subject to the limits of our insurance policies 
stock based compensation we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method in under this method  stock based compensation expense is recognized using the fair value based method for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption 
we have adopted the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of each option grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the year ended december   the board of directors granted restricted stock awards of  shares under our stock option and restricted stock plan  which was amended and approved by our shareholders in may under the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  share based compensation cost for stock awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 

table of contents we amortize stock based compensation for both stock option grants and stock awards over a period of months  with the first th  vesting six months from the grant date and the balance vesting in equal amounts every six months thereafter 
on may   our board of directors determined that the following policy will apply to grants of stock options under any of the jones soda co 
existing stock option plans without the prior approval of the jones soda co 
s shareholders  stock option grants under any of the jones soda co 
stock option plans will not be repriced  replaced or regranted in the form of replacement options  stock awards  or by lowering the option exercise price of a previously granted option 
results of operations for the year ended december  for ease of presentation in the following discussions of results of operations and liquidity and capital resources  we round amounts less than one million dollars to the nearest thousand dollars and amounts greater than one million dollars to the nearest hundred thousand dollars 
revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands gross revenue less promotion allowances and slotting fees net revenues revenue increase gross revenues  which excludes the impact of slotting fees and promotional allowances  is a non gaap financial measure 
the most directly comparable gaap measure is net revenues 
under gaap  slotting fees and promotional allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue in calculating net revenues 
gross revenues is used by management to monitor operating performance  including in comparison to prior years  as it allows evaluation of sales performance before the effects of any slotting fees and promotional items  which can mask certain performance issues 
management believes that the presentation of gross revenues provides useful information to investors because it allows a more comprehensive presentation of the company s operating performance 
however  gross revenues should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net revenues 
gross revenues may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as slotting fees and promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers 
this table reconciles gross revenues to net revenues 
although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with gaap and meet gaap requirements  the disclosure thereof does not conform with gaap presentation requirements 
additionally  the presentation of promotional allowances and slotting fees may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies 
the presentation of promotional allowances and slotting fees facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net revenues and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales 
fiscal to for the year ended december   net revenues were approximately  an increase of  or over the approximately  in net revenues for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to increased case sales through our dtr and dsd network  as well as a higher overall price per case in for the year ended december   our gross revenue was reduced by  on account of slotting fees and promotion allowances  compared to a reduction of  for the year ended december  
table of contents during  the total amount of slotting fees recorded as a reduction of revenue was approximately  cash considerations and discounts amounted to approximately  and the remaining amount of approximately  was for promotion allowances 
the slotting fees were incurred to gain entry into the csd channel for our oz cans 
we do not expect the same level of investments in slotting fees for we expect promotional allowance spending to be flat for compared to levels 
the increase in revenues in our dtr channel for compared to was due to increased case sales of jones soda ounce bottles to wal mart  sam s club and shipments of c to winco foods 
this was offset by the reduction of sales to starbucks in  as starbucks stopped purchasing jones pure cane soda for its stores in the us in the second quarter of revenues in our dsd network increased for the year 
increased case sales in the northeast  southeast  northwest  eastern canada and western canada were partially offset by decreased case sales in the midwest and southwest 
the decreased case sales in the midwest and southwest were due to changeover of distributors and soft market conditions 
concentrate sales to national beverage in  included primarily sales of jones pure cane soda concentrate  were primarily made during the first three quarters of there was very minimal shipment of concentrate in the fourth quarter of due to promotion programs not generating expected sell through to generate production orders from national beverage 
concentrate case sales for the year ended december   include sales of concentrate of jones pure cane soda and jones energy to national beverage corp 
concentrate case sales in fiscal consisted solely of sales during the second quarter of of jones energy concentrate to national beverage for sale through costco and jones soda concentrate sales in the fourth quarter 
during  we have significantly increased the number of retail stores carrying our ounce can product 
the number of stores available to carry our product increased from approximately  stores in to approximately  stores in we acquired this increased distribution through our sales and marketing efforts in the csd channel throughout the year and also through the payment of slotting fees 
in addition  revenues for the year ended december  include sales of c  our enhanced water beverage  and sales under our sponsorship agreement with the seattle seahawks  for which we had no comparable sales in fiscal in  we commenced shipment of c to retailers and distributors in various focus markets 
we anticipate shipping out c to other markets in the us and canada in consolidated case sales of all products including all finished products and concentrate sales through our dsd  dtr and csd channels for the year ended december   expressed as ounce equivalent cases  were  this is an increase of  cases or over total case sales for the year ended december  ounce equivalent case sales finished products case sales concentrate case sales total case sales fiscal to for the year ended december   revenues were approximately  an increase of  or over the  in revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due to increased revenue through our dtr channel offset by a 
table of contents decrease in revenues in our dsd channel in compared to in addition to the above factor  the increase in revenue for reflects sales of our valentines packs for which we had no similar promotion in and sales of concentrate for our jones energy cans during the second quarter of and sales of concentrate for our jones pure cane soda cans during the fourth quarter of we had no concentrate sales in the comparable period in the overall decrease in revenues in our dsd network in compared to was due primarily to decreased case sales of jones soda and jones organics through our distributor network in the northwest  midwest and southwest us these decreases were partially offset by slight increases in case sales in the northeast  southeast  eastern and western canada 
the increase in revenues in our dtr network was also due to our strategy of growing national retail accounts 
in we recorded increased revenues over fiscal from certain of our existing national retail accounts including target corporation  starbucks coffee company  panera bread company  and barnes noble 
starbucks coffee company stopped ordering jones pure cane soda for its stores in the us in the second quarter of revenues for the fiscal year also reflect a price increase for certain products implemented during the first quarter of consolidated case sales of all products finished products and concentrate for the year ended december  expressed as ounce equivalent cases were  an increase of or  cases from total case sales of  in we had no case sales of concentrate in gross profit year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit increase decrease gross profit as a percentage of revenue fiscal to for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by approximately  or as compared to  in gross profit for the year ended december  for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december   was attributable to increased recording of slotting fees and promotion allowances which reduced revenues by  and inventory provisions and write downs of approximately  related to  among other items  the transition from high fructose corn syrup to pure cane sugar production during the first three quarters and the discontinuance of our ounce jones soda cans and certain special packs and flavors in the fourth quarter 
changes in product mix and sales mix in the dsd and dtr channels also contributed to the lower margins as we shipped more product to our dtr customers where we receive lower gross margins than shipments to our distributors 
we continued to experience higher co packing costs for some of our products due to increases in energy costs  co packing fees  currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar and freight costs 
during  we continued to shift a portion of our bottling requirements to our u 
s co packers in an effort to reduce freight and co packing costs 
we expect similar margin pressure from these factors in 
table of contents fiscal to for the year ended december   gross profit increased by approximately  or over the  in gross profit for the year ended december  for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to from for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved product mix 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to improved product mix and the overall increase in the average selling price per case 
higher margins on the sales of concentrate for the jones energy ounce  jones ounce pure cane soda and valentines packs improved the product mix and gross margin improvement 
in  we continued to experience higher co packing costs for some of our products due to increases in energy costs  co packing fees and freight costs 
in response  we continued to shift a portion of our bottling requirements to our u 
s co packers in an effort to reduce freight and co packing costs 
licensing revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands licensing revenue licensing revenue increase decrease fiscal to licensing revenue during the year ended december  was primarily due to our exclusive arrangements with big sky brands for jones soda flavor booster hard candy and remaining royalties on the sale of remaining high fructose corn syrup inventory through target corporation 
in contrast  for the year ended december   licensing revenue consisted primarily of royalty payments on the sale of ounce cans pursuant to our exclusive licensing arrangement with target corporation that expired on december   and to a lesser extent our licensing arrangement with big sky brands 
for the year ended december   we received royalty payments under these arrangements of approximately  as compared to licensing revenue of  for the year ended december   a decrease of 
we do not expect licensing revenue to represent a material portion of our overall revenues in fiscal to for the year ended december   we received licensing revenue of approximately  a decrease of  or  over licensing revenue of  for the year ended december  the majority of our licensing revenue was from our exclusive arrangement with target corporation to sell jones soda in a ounce can fridge pack 
this agreement expired on december  during  target licensing revenue decreased from comparable periods in the prior year due to reduced promotion spending 
some of this decrease was offset by increased licensing revenue from big sky brand for the jones soda flavor hard candy 
licensing revenue also includes revenue from our license arrangements with lime lite marketing corporation for jones soda lip balms and the kroger co 
for jones soda frozen soda pops 
we discontinued the licensing agreement with kroger for jones soda frozen soda pops in

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials including  but not limited to  increases in the price of aluminum for cans  resin for pet plastic bottles  as well as cane sugar  and the limited availability of certain raw materials and co packer capacity 
we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and foreign exchange risk due to our sales and co packing operations in canada 
we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectability of accounts receivable and obsolescence of inventory due to changes in market conditions or new product initiatives 
we believe that our exposure to these risks as of december  is not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations  and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices 
we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials  including  but not limited to  cans  pet plastic bottles  glass  labels  pure cane sugar or packaging arrangements  or protecting against shortages of raw materials 
with respect to foreign currency risk  the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the us dollar 
however  we held aggregate cash and operating assets in canadian dollars valued at approximately us  as of december  at december   the majority of our debt consisted of fixed rate debt under our capital leases and we have no long term debt 
during the year ended december   we did not make any draws on our line of credit
