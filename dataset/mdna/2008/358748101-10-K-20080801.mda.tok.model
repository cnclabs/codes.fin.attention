corporate overview the operations of frisch s restaurants  inc and subsidiaries the company consist of two reportable segments within the restaurant industry full service family style big boy restaurants and grill buffet style golden corral restaurants

record revenue of  was achieved in fiscal year without benefit of the rd week  revenue would have been approximately  or  lower 
comparable revenue was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the comparable sales improvement week basis in fiscal year was achieved primarily through new restaurant openings

net earnings for fiscal year were  or diluted earnings per share eps of 
net earnings in fiscal year were  diluted eps and  diluted eps was posted in fiscal year fiscal year included a non cash pretax impairment of assets charge of  
diluted eps to lower the carrying values of three golden corral restaurants that management concluded were impaired 
in addition to the impairment charge noted above  other factors having a noteworthy effect on pretax earnings in fiscal year the rd week contributed an estimated  in pretax earnings the escalating costs of food placed a significant squeeze on operating margins 
as a percentage of sales  food costs increased to percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year 
table of contents adjustments to self insurance reserves  was credited to pretax earnings in fiscal year  which was  less than fiscal year gains on the sale of real estate were  during fiscal year  which was  more than fiscal year another significant factor affecting the company s operations has been the annual increase in the minimum wage as mandated by ohio voters in the november election 
the minimum wage increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour effective january  in accordance with the mandate s annual provision to adjust automatically for the rate of inflation 
the minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  in accordance with the mandate s inflation provision 
since more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred in ohio  two major initiatives were launched in january to counter the effects of paying the required higher hourly rate of pay 
the first step was to implement an immediate increase in menu prices 
next  hours were reduced to bring payroll into line 
these measures have effectively mitigated the higher pay rates 
effective july   legislation increased the federal minimum wage from per hour to per hour for non tipped employees 
the legislation includes scheduled increases to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees was not changed by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
thus far  the effect of the federal legislation has been minimal  as conditions in most markets already dictate wage rates in excess of per hour  and because the ohio minimum wage already exceeds the federal requirement 
additional reductions in scheduled labor hours will likely be implemented to combat the effects of the federal increase in july  when the rate will increase to per hour 
results of operations sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur as new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed

year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal marked the eleventh consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved 
the same store sales improvement was driven by higher average guest checks  the result of menu price increases 
however  the higher menu prices likely contributed to the continuing trend in lower customer traffic 
customer counts in same stores were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year in addition  management believes a direct correlation exists between the lower customer counts and the steep cost of gasoline  as the higher cost to fill up a tank leaves many consumers with less money available to spend on a restaurant meal 
the company s midwest market areas are continuing to experience difficulty recovering from and adjusting to high gasoline prices 
the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal years  and the percent increase in the third quarter of fiscal year included a specific provision to offset costs associated with minimum wage increases 
the first quarters of fiscal years  and included average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
in addition  a price increase of 
percent went into effect in april and another will likely be implemented in september the company operated big boy restaurants as of june   a net reduction of one since the beginning of the three year period that began may  the count of includes two that opened respectively in june and july  plus a new restaurant that opened in august  which replaced an older building on the same site 
the count of big boy restaurants also includes the effect of closing three low volume restaurants during fiscal year one in june  the other two on june  near the end of the fiscal year 
included in the count is a big boy restaurant that was taken out of service and razed on june  to make room for a new building on the same site 
it is currently under construction  scheduled to re open in september in addition  two big boy restaurants are currently under construction on new sites 
golden corral sales in fiscal year were over  higher than fiscal year the increase is largely attributable to a new golden corral restaurant that opened for business in july  the first to open since november the company now operates golden corral restaurants 
no other golden corral restaurants are currently planned to open over the next twelve months 
following general industry practice  the same store sales comparisons in the table that follows use a formula that includes only those restaurants that were open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
this removes possible misleading numbers that can be caused by the great influx of customers during the first several months of operation  sometimes called the honeymoon period of a new restaurant 
under the formula  of restaurants were included in the quarterly and annualized fiscal year same store sales calculations

year fiscal fiscal fiscal year marked the fourth consecutive year of same store sales declines  a period that includes seventeen of the last nineteen quarters 
higher average guest checks are the result of menu price increases 
as with big boy  the combination of higher menu prices and the steep cost of gasoline has likely caused the continuation of lower customer counts that have been experienced 
same store customer counts were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year 
table of contents golden corral menu prices were increased 
percent march  percent october  percent june  percent january and percent september 
the percent increase in january was put in place specifically to help offset the effects of higher costs associated with minimum wage increases 
in addition  a 
percent increase went into effect in june gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes wholesale sales and cost of wholesale sales 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit discussed in note g segment information to the consolidated financial statements  as advertising expense and impairment of asset losses are charged against restaurant level profit 
gross profit for both operating segments is shown below 
fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in thousands big boy gross profit golden corral gross profit total gross profit the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of total sales  including big boy wholesale sales 
the table supplements the discussion that follows which addresses cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs 
total bb gc total bb gc total bb gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit the market for beef remains highly volatile  as import and export restrictions can and do cause wide cost fluctuations 
in addition  currency markets relative to the weakened us dollar together with high fuel costs have greatly increased the cost of the three major grains corn  soybeans and wheat that are the principal feed ingredients for cattle  hogs and poultry 
these unfavorable market conditions continue to pose a difficult environment in which to contain food costs 
the effect of commodity price increases is actively managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection and rotation of items served on the golden corral buffet  together with periodic increases in menu prices 
rapid escalations in costs for protein items such as poultry  pork  beef and fish products can be problematic to effective menu management  as can be seen in the rising percentages in the above table despite higher prices being charged to customers 
food cost percentages in the golden corral segment are much higher than big boy because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral segment  as well as its use of steak as an item featured daily on the buffet 
the favorable trends in payroll and related costs percentages in both operating segments is an indicator that the mandated increases in the minimum wage have been effectively mitigated by the higher menu prices and management s resolve to reduce the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees 
although there is no 
table of contents seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  hours worked have always been managed closely according to restaurant sales patterns 
payroll related costs include statutory provisions for social security  unemployment and workers compensation  along with voluntary benefits provided by the company such as defined benefit pension plans and medical insurance 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
management performs a comprehensive review each fiscal quarter and adjusts the self insurance reserves as deemed appropriate based on claims experience 
favorable adjustments were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and improvements in claims experience  the result of active claims management and post accident drug testing  have allowed lower rates as a percentage of payroll to be used to accrue initial reserves 
the lower rates  which have been in effect since fiscal year  should produce a continuation in the trend of reducing the size of future quarterly adjustments 
net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the reduction in fiscal year is due to the combination of favorable asset returns and favorable pay experience 
pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal years and  lowered from percent used in fiscal year the assumption will remain at percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year the weighted average discount rate mirrors movement in the underlying markets and is considered a snapshot rate reflecting current market conditions 
the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and was percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be percent 
the rate of compensation increase for pension costs was percent in each of fiscal years  and it will remain at percent for fiscal year cash contributions made by the company to these plans were  in each of fiscal years and contributions for fiscal year are currently estimated at  other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  new restaurant opening costs and many other restaurant operating costs 
opening costs can have a significant impact on the percentages 
opening cost charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
there should be no opening costs for golden corral in fiscal year since most of these expenses tend to be fixed costs  the percentages shown in the above table are greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
other operating costs are a much higher percentage of sales for the golden corral segment as sales volumes remain well below expectation 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while franchise fees and other revenue are added to it 
gains and losses on sale of real property  if any  are then respectively added or subtracted 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and although a charge of  in fiscal year is included in administrative costs to write off multiple deposits for golden corral development rights  the decrease in fiscal year is largely attributable to no incentive compensation being earned by the chief executive officer 
stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were  fiscal year and  in fiscal year revenue from franchise fees is based on sales volumes of big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales generated by the licensed restaurants and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of june   big boy restaurants licensed to other operators were paying 
table of contents franchise fees to the company 
no licensed big boy restaurants have opened or closed during any of the periods presented in this md a 
other revenue also includes certain other fees from licensed restaurants along with miscellaneous rent and investment income 
gains and losses on sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that often arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
gains from the sale of real property amounted to  during fiscal year the gains resulted from the dispositions of three low volume big boy restaurants that had ceased operations respectively in january  april and june during fiscal year  a gain of  was recorded from the sale of an older big boy restaurant that closed in october the amount reported on the same line in fiscal year resulted principally from a gain in connection with an eminent domain proceeding 
a gain of approximately  has already been recorded in fiscal year from the sale of a low volume big boy restaurant that closed on june  the test for impairment of assets completed at the end of fiscal year determined that the carrying values of three golden corral restaurant locations exceeded expected future cash flows to be generated by the underlying assets 
as a result  a non cash pretax charge of  was recorded to lower the carrying values to fair values 
the total charge reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings includes impairment losses of  for intangible assets associated with unamortized initial franchise fees relating to the three impaired restaurants 
the three impaired restaurants continue to operate 
no significant charges for impairment of assets were recorded during either fiscal year or fiscal year other expense income interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreasing trend is primarily the result of lower debt levels and lower variable interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips 
to a lesser degree  the company also uses the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
as required  the company adopted the provisions of fin in fiscal year fin is the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings resulted from the adoption of fin and there was no material change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds food sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in cash or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines are readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 

table of contents aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  payments due by period in thousands more than total year year year year year years long term debt      rent due under capital lease obligations  rent due under operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    other long term obligations  total contractual cash obligations    not included in the table is a secondary liability for the performance of a ground lease that has been assigned to a third party 
the annual obligation of the lease approximates through should the third party default  the company has the right to re assign the lease 
operating leases include option periods considered to be part of the lease term under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
primarily consists of commitments for certain food and beverage items  plus capital projects including commitments to purchase real property 
deferred compensation liability 
the working capital deficit was  as of june  the deficit was  as of may  the improvement in the deficit is twofold 
first  lower costs relating to new unit construction are included in accounts payable one new big boy restaurant was under construction as of june   while three big boys and one golden corral were at various stages of construction as of may  secondly  the current portion of long term debt at june  is almost  lower than it was at may  in september  the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the terms of the company s construction draw credit facility was increased to  as of june    was available to be drawn upon before the facility expires on september  an additional  is available to the company under the terms of a working capital revolving line of credit that also expires september  operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year   lower than fiscal year and  higher than fiscal year these changes are primarily attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories and accounts payable  all of which can and often do fluctuate widely 
management believes a better  more reliable gauge to measure cash flows from the operation of the business is to use the simple method of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets  and stock based compensation expense 
the result of this method is reflected as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year investing activities capital spending is the principal component of investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year this year s capital spending includes  for big boy restaurants and  for golden 
table of contents corral restaurants 
the spending is indicative of management s emphasis on big boy development 
these capital expenditures consisted of new restaurant construction  site acquisitions for expansion  remodeling existing restaurants including kitchen redesigns and dining room expansions  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
proceeds from the disposition of property during fiscal year amounted to  primarily from the sale of three low volume big boy restaurants that respectively ceased operations in january  april and june dispositions of property in fiscal year yielded proceeds of  primarily from the sale of a big boy restaurant that closed in october proceeds from dispositions of property in fiscal year consisted of the sale of two pieces of land that the company had originally intended to develop that ultimately proved to be not viable  plus proceeds from an eminent domain proceeding 
two other low volume big boy restaurants closed june   shortly before the end of fiscal year one of the locations was sold in june fiscal year  yielding proceeds of almost  the other location remains for sale 
financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year regular quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled  in fiscal year the rate per share was increased from 
to 
per share effective with the dividend that was paid in january the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends 
to that end  the board of directors declared the company s th consecutive quarterly dividend on june  it was paid at the rate of 
per share on july  to shareholders of record on june  during fiscal year  employees acquired approximately  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options  yielding proceeds to the company of approximately  as of june    shares granted under the company s two stock option plans remain outstanding  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share of 
as of june   approximately  shares remained available to be granted under these plans 
in january  the board of directors authorized a new repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market or through block trades over a two year period that expires january  through june   the company had acquired  shares under the program at a cost of approximately  other information the company s th golden corral restaurant opened for business in july it was the first new golden corral restaurant to be opened by the company since november in april  the area development agreement with golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor was amended to lower from to twelve  the company s development rights to build future restaurants 
as a result  the company wrote off franchise fee deposits totaling  although the company continues to possess development rights for up to twelve more golden corral restaurants  approval has been granted by the franchisor to curtail development until operating performance levels improve in existing restaurants 
the curtailment allows the company to use cash flows and credit facilities in a manner that strengthens the balance sheet and keeps interest costs in check  while allowing operations to focus on rebuilding same store sales levels 
no further development is currently planned and there is no active search for sites on which to build 
the golden corral restaurants for which impairment of assets charges were recorded in fiscal year will continue to operate for the foreseeable future 
the average cost to renovate five golden corral restaurants in fiscal year was  three golden corrals are currently scheduled for a five year renovation in fiscal year an asian style pagoda bar and a chocolate fixation station were added to six golden corral restaurants in fiscal year at an average cost of  it is currently anticipated that six more locations will receive these upgrades in fiscal year 
table of contents two new big boy restaurants opened for business respectively in june and july a third big boy restaurant opened in august that was the replacement on the same site of an older facility that closed and was razed in april one new big boy was under construction as of june  construction began on a second new big boy in july in addition  an older facility was taken out of service and razed on june  to make room for a new building on the same site 
including land and land improvements  the cash required to build and equip each new big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
as of june   the company was under contracts totaling  to acquire two sites for future big boy development 
several other sites are currently being evaluated for future acquisition and development 
approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with the newer prototype restaurants that were introduced several years ago 
the average cost in fiscal year to renovate a typical older restaurant was approximately  newer prototype restaurants that reached five years of age also received renovations  which on the average approximated  in fiscal year in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether an expansion of the dining room is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to  the company s policy is to own the land on which it builds new restaurants 
however  it is often necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
eight of the golden corral restaurants now in operation were built on leased land 
three big boy restaurants opened since were also built on leased land 
all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
as of june   restaurants were in operation on non owned premises  which are covered by lease agreements 
five of the leases are for big boy facilities that are continuing to be occupied on a month to month basis until the company acquires the properties from the landlord pursuant to certain provisions contained in the respective leases 
the purchase prices are the subject of litigation 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections 

table of contents pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
assets of the pension plans are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee looks at the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments and matches those to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is selected  and then rounded to the nearest basis points  which produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximates to percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed the greater of the net present value of the future cash flow stream or a floor value 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
floor values are provided by real estate brokers and or the company s past experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor performance 
the final impairment amount can be significantly different from the initial charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of floor values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not use foreign currency 
big boy restaurants utilize centralized purchasing and food preparation  which is provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
the company believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and creates efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside the company s control  including import and export restrictions  the influence of currency markets relative to the us dollar  supply versus demand  production levels and the impact that adverse weather may have on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  
table of contents chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as bread  fresh produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of local suppliers  the golden corral segment of the business currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items from the same approved vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc the franchisor uses in its operations 
deliveries are received twice per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
