management overview fiscal the year in review throughout fiscal  starbucks continued to experience declining comparable store sales in its us stores  primarily due to lower customer traffic 
with the us segment representing of consolidated revenues  the impact of this decline on the company s financial results for fiscal was significant 
for fiscal year comparable store sales declined in the us  with a declining trend over the course of the year  ending with a decline of in the fourth quarter 
the company also experienced declining comparable sales in canada and the uk  its two largest company operated international markets  primarily due to lower traffic 
the company believes that the weaker traffic has been caused by a number of ongoing factors in the global economies that have negatively impacted consumers discretionary spending  as well as factors within the company s control with respect to the pace of store openings in the us and store level execution 
in the us  the economic factors included the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food  rising levels of unemployment and personal debt  reduced access to consumer credit  and lower home values as well as increased foreclosure activity in certain areas of the country california and florida where starbucks has a high concentration of company operated stores 
these developments combined with recent and ongoing unprecedented shocks to the global financial system and capital markets have all contributed to sharp declines in consumer confidence in the us 
starbucks business is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in customer traffic 
increased customer visits create sales leverage  meaning that fixed expenses  such as occupancy costs  are spread across a greater revenue base  thereby improving operating margins 
but the reverse is also true sales de leveraging creates downward pressure on margins 
the softness in us revenues during fiscal impacted nearly all consolidated and us segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales 
since january  when company founder howard schultz reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman  starbucks has taken steps to address the deterioration in the us retail environment and address its global support structure 
these included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to reinvigorate the starbucks experience for the company s customers  increase customer traffic in its us stores  reduce infrastructure expenses  and improve the company s results of operations 
these significant actions have been designed to structure the company s business for long term profitable growth 
as a result of the continued weak economy and decreased customer traffic  as well as the costs associated with the store closures and other actions in its transformation strategy  the company s fiscal results were negatively impacted in the following ways consolidated operating income was million in fiscal  and operating margin for the year was compared with in the prior year 
approximately basis points of the decrease in operating margin was a result of restructuring charges  primarily related to the significant us store closures 
softness in us revenues along with higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses were also significant drivers in the margin decline 
eps for fiscal was  compared to eps of per share earned in the prior year 
restructuring charges and costs associated with the execution of the transformation agenda impacted eps by approximately per share in fiscal 
table of contents significant actions taken in fiscal the more significant actions taken by starbucks in fiscal to transform and reinvigorate its business included a plan to close approximately underperforming company operated stores in the us market  of which were closed as of fiscal year end with the remaining stores to be closed by the end of fiscal  restructuring the company s australia business by closing company operated stores  focusing on the remaining stores in three key metro areas  reducing approximately  open and filled positions within the company s leadership structure and its non store organization  to rationalize its infrastructure for the reduced number of stores  and introducing new beverage platforms designed to reinvigorate the starbucks beverage offerings  new breakfast food offerings and bakery and chilled foods  including health and wellness choices  and a new  everyday brewed coffee  pike place tm roast  which returned the company to the practice of grinding whole beans in stores and brewing every minutes to provide customers with the freshest coffee possible 
fiscal the view ahead management expects the company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal  both in the us and internationally  including in its two largest company operated markets of canada and the uk 
as the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified  other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely 
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending  the company expects to face an extremely challenging fiscal because of these economic conditions 
accordingly  starbucks expects to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal additionally  the company s earnings for fiscal will be impacted by lease termination and severance costs from the us and australia store closures  totaling up to an estimated of eps for fiscal the company estimates that the combination of the us and australia store closures and head count reductions will result in a pre tax benefit to operating income of approximately million to million in fiscal  which equates to approximately to of eps 
starbucks plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings  in both company operated and licensed markets  and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the global economy 
starbucks fiscal us store opening target is approximately a negative net new stores  which includes a nearly company operated store decline and approximately net new licensed stores 
internationally  starbucks is planning to open approximately net new stores in fiscal  two thirds of which are expected to be licensed  as it factors in the current global economic climate  with a more cautious approach in the uk and western europe 
operating segment overview starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states  international and cpg 
the united states and international segments both include company operated retail stores  licensed retail stores and foodservice operations 
licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee 
the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated compared to the us segment  however  the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature us segment has significantly more stores  and higher total revenues than the international segment 
average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 
further  certain market costs  particularly occupancy costs  are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment  which comprises a more diverse group of operations 
as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment  the number of stores  the higher unit volumes  and the lower market costs  the us segment  despite its higher relative percentage of company operated stores  has a higher operating margin  excluding restructuring costs  than the less developed international segment 

table of contents the company s international store base continues to increase and starbucks has been achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china  brazil and russia 
the company s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 
the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea as well as branded products operations worldwide 
the cpg segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners  most significantly the north american coffee partnership with the pepsi cola company for distribution of ready to drink beverages  and with kraft foods inc for distribution of packaged coffees and teas 
this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way 
most of the customer revenues from the ready to drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner  not by the cpg segment  and the proportionate share of the results of the company s joint ventures are included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
as a result  the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues  a modest cost structure  and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the company s other two reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 
these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses  related depreciation and amortization expenses  restructuring charges and amounts included in interest income and other  net and interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings 
acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated results of operations in millions sep  sep  sep  sep  fiscal year ended change of total net revenues statements of earnings data net revenues company operated retail specialty licensing foodservice and other total specialty total net revenues net revenues for the fiscal year ended increased due to growth in both company operated retail revenues and specialty operations 
during fiscal  starbucks derived of total net revenues from its company operated retail stores 
company operated retail revenues increased  primarily attributable to the opening of new company operated retail stores in the last months  offset by negative comparable store sales for the same period 
revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment  which posted a comparable store sales decline of for the year 
partially offsetting this was comparable store sales growth in the international segment 
within fiscal  consolidated quarterly revenue 
table of contents growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter  reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the us 
the company derived the remaining of total net revenues from channels outside the company operated retail stores  collectively known as specialty operations 
licensing revenues  which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery  warehouse club and certain other branded product operations  increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of new licensed retail stores in the last months 
the increase in foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the us foodservice business 
for fiscal  the company expects total revenues to be relatively flat compared to fiscal  with variations driven by the level of comparable store sales

as discussed in the management overview section above  many of the company s operating expenses are fixed in nature 
as a result  the softness in us revenues during fiscal impacted nearly all consolidated and us segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales  and pressured operating margins 
cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues 
store operating expenses as a percentage of company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the us business  primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of new company operated retail stores in the last months 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll related expenses 
restructuring charges include asset impairment  lease exit and severance costs 
these costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the us and australia  and the rationalization of the company s leadership structure and non store organization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

sep  sep  sep  sep  fiscal year ended change of total net revenues interest income and other  net interest expense earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings interest income and other net  decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the company s trading securities portfolio 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the trading securities approximate a portion of the company s liability under its management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance  with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings 
interest expense increased due to the company s issuance of million of year senior notes in august of fiscal income taxes for the fiscal year ended resulted in an effective tax rate of compared to for fiscal the lower rate is due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates  as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the us

liquidity and capital resources the company s existing cash and liquid investments were million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
the decrease in liquid investments was driven primarily by million of auction rate securities  nearly all of which are held within the company s wholly owned captive insurance company  that are not currently considered liquid and were reclassified to long term investments in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following a portfolio of unrestricted trading securities  designed to hedge the company s liability under its management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
the value of this portfolio was million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
the decrease was driven by the sale of a bond income fund to better align with the company s total risk profile and declines in market values of the underlying equity funds  which were offset by a comparable decline in the mdcp liability 
unrestricted cash and liquid securities  held within the company s wholly owned captive insurance company  to fund claim payouts 
the value of these unrestricted cash and liquid securities was approximately million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to reclassification of auction rate securities held by the wholly owned captive 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of september   the company had million invested in available for sale securities  consisting primarily of auction rate securities 
while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time  the company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs  capital expenditures or other business requirements 
the company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings 
following the company s announcement on july  that it planned to close approximately underperforming us company operated stores and reduce new store growth in fiscal year  standard poor s placed the bbb long term rating and a short term ratings for starbucks on creditwatch with negative implications 
on july   moody s placed the baa senior unsecured rating for starbucks on review for possible downgrade  however moody s reaffirmed the company s prime short term rating for commercial paper 
standard and poor s and moody s subsequently downgraded the long term ratings as of september  and november   respectively 
credit rating agencies currently rate the company s borrowings as follows description standard poor s moody s short term debt a p senior unsecured long term debt bbb baa outlook stable negative standard poor s downgraded the company s long term rating from bbb to bbb on september   and re affirmed the a short term rating 
at the same time  standard poor s outlook was changed to stable 
moody s downgraded the company s long term rating from baa to baa on november   and re affirmed the company s prime short term rating for commercial paper 
at the same time  moody s outlook was changed to negative 
factors that may affect credit ratings include changes in the company s operating performance  the economic environment and the company s capital structure 
in order to maintain its credit ratings  there is an expectation that the company will modestly reduce its leverage during fiscal the company expects to improve its leverage ratio below a certain target level primarily through the reduction in short term borrowings 
credit rating downgrades can adversely impact  among other things  future borrowing costs  access to capital markets  and future operating lease terms 
if either of the company s short term ratings were downgraded  it would likely make the issuance of commercial paper difficult 
in these circumstances the company could draw upon its credit facility 
in normal market conditions  it is generally more favorable for the company to issue commercial paper rather than borrow against the credit facility 
however  as described in item a risk factors the ongoing global financial crisis may result in conditions where commercial paper is not available at reasonable rates 
in such situations the company is more likely to draw on its credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company borrowed against the credit facility as liquidity conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated 
as of september   borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled million 

table of contents the company s credit facility contains provisions requiring starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of september  and september   the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 
on october   the company entered into an amendment to the credit facility to exclude up to million of lease termination expenses and lease exit costs incurred during the period beginning on june  and ending september  from the agreement s operating lease and rental expense definition 
the purpose of the amendment was to limit the short term effects of lease related restructuring expenses from the company s store closure actions on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
these expenses would have otherwise put pressure on the coverage ratio and raised the risk of the company losing access to liquidity 
over the long term  the reduction in lease expense and improvement in operating cash flows resulting from these store closures are expected to have a favorable effect on this coverage ratio 
the amendment also increased the cost to borrow under the facility by an additional to  depending on the company s fixed charge ratio and its senior unsecured debt rating 
the million of year senior notes  issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal  also require starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties 
as of september  and september   the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 
the company expects to use its cash and liquid investments  including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in its core businesses  including new beverage innovations  as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses 
the company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees 
any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the company s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent 
depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure  starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program 
due to the current challenging operating and economic environment  the company continues to be conservative in its uses of cash and did not repurchase any shares in the second  third or fourth quarters of fiscal management also does not currently anticipate any share repurchases in fiscal management believes that cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and liquid investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future  as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and severance costs from the us and australia store closures 
as a result  the company expects to decrease short term borrowings in fiscal significant new joint ventures  acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 
other than normal operating expenses  cash requirements for fiscal are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company operated retail stores  remodeling and refurbishment of existing company operated retail stores  and new equipment to support enhanced quality standards and expanded offerings in the stores 
other capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to consist principally of investments in information technology systems and in the company s global supply chain operations 
total expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to billion for fiscal compared to the corresponding period of fiscal the modest decrease was primarily due to the slowing pace of store construction which led to a decline in the balance in accounts payable year over year 
cash used by investing activities for fiscal totaled billion 
net capital additions to property  plant and equipment used million  primarily from opening new company operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores during fiscal in addition  the sale and maturity of available for sale securities provided million and million  respectively  for fiscal  consisting primarily of auction rate securities and agency notes 
the auction rate securities were sold through the normal auction process prior to the auction failures that began in mid february  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the agency notes  issued by government sponsored enterprises  were called in the first half of fiscal cash used by financing activities for fiscal totaled million 
cash used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock totaled million  all in the first quarter of fiscal this amount includes the

partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the company s common stock from employee stock purchase plans 
as options granted are exercised  starbucks will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction  but the amount and the timing of these cash flows cannot be reliably predicted as option holders decisions to exercise options will be largely driven by movements in the company s stock price

table of contents financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices  and interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings 
the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 
in general  hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk the company purchases commodity inputs  including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results 
in addition to fixed priced contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  the company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of the company s operations consists of activities outside of the united states  the company has transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of september   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan  as well as the company s net investments in its canada  uk  and china subsidiaries  to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the hedging period 
the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company s future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates 
the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions september  increase decrease to net earnings increase decrease to oci increase in decrease in increase in decrease in underlying rate underlying rate underlying rate underlying rate foreign currency hedges

the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of its investments  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
interest rate risk the company utilizes short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
at the end of fiscal years and  the company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the company s debt in millions september  change in fair value basis point increase in basis point decrease in fair value underlying rate underlying rate debt the company s available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments

application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment  stock based compensation  operating leases  self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
asset impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows  in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
for goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company s trademarks 
upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
judgments made by the company related to 
table of contents the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 
stock based compensation starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
operating leases starbucks leases retail stores  roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation aro expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs 
future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 
in addition  the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense  as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 
starbucks accounts for lease contract termination costs in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 
self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates
