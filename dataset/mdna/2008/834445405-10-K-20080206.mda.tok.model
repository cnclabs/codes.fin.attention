overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos system  a non invasive patient monitoring system that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen levels in the brain and elsewhere in the body in somatic  or skeletal muscle  tissue in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
we began commercializing our model invos system internationally in the third quarter of fiscal and in the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal unlike earlier models  the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
from product launch until the first quarter of fiscal  we focused our marketing efforts primarily on adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries and carotid artery surgeries 
during the second quarter of fiscal  results of both the first prospective  randomized clinical trial and a larger retrospective review evaluating the invos system were presented  which we believe have contributed to the invos system gaining further market penetration 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated selling and marketing efforts for the invos system in the pediatric intensive care unit  or icu 
we plan to launch the invos system into the neonatal icu in early after completing additional market research of a smaller somasensor 
we are currently sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age if results of this trial are positive  we intend to target more actively the sale of the invos system for use in diabetic patients undergoing major general surgeries  consistent with fda requirements 
in november  we received k clearance from the fda to market our invos system to monitor changes in somatic tissue blood oxygen saturation in regions of the body other than the brain in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
our four channel cerebral and somatic invos system monitor  which we launched in the second quarter of  can display information from four somasensors  which allows for the simultaneous monitoring of changes in blood oxygen saturation in the brain and  in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow  in somatic tissue 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction 
in november  we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states 
sales of correstore systems represented less than one percent of our fiscal net revenues 
net revenues and cost of sales we derive our revenues from sales of invos systems and correstore systems to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales team and independent sales representative firms 
outside the united states  we have distribution agreements with independent distributors for the invos system  including covidien  formerly tyco healthcare  in europe  canada  the middle east and south africa  and edwards lifesciences ltd 
in japan 
our cost of sales represent the cost of producing monitors and disposable somasensors 
revenues from outside the united states contributed percent to our fiscal net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  the gross margins 
table of contents from our international sales are typically lower than gross margins from our us sales  reflecting the difference between the prices we receive from distributors and from direct customers 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for us sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our invos system revenues are derived from the sale of monitors and our disposable somasensors 
we intend that disposables will form the basis of a recurring revenue stream 
in addition  we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years  and this depreciation is included in cost of goods sold 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our employees and consultants  sales and marketing expenses  such as employee sales commissions  commissions to independent sales representatives  travel  entertainment  advertising  education and training expenses  depreciation of demonstration monitors and attendance at selected medical conferences  clinical research expenses  such as costs of supporting clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses  such as the cost of corporate operations  professional services  stock compensation  insurance  warranty and royalty expenses  investor relations  depreciation and amortization  facilities expenses and other general operating expenses 
we have increased the size of our direct sales team from persons at the end of fiscal to persons at the end of fiscal we expect to increase the size of our us direct sales team in fiscal and are evaluating placing direct salespersons and clinical specialists in europe to support covidien 
we also expect our clinical research expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age and other clinical trials 
as a result  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our research and development personnel and consultants  costs of various development projects  and costs of preparing and processing applications for fda clearance of new products 
for the fiscal year ended november   we recorded a research and development expense of  in connection with our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement with neurophysics corporation 
deferred tax assets and impairment charges for the fiscal year ended november  we recorded an impairment expense of  associated with the write down of our intangible asset associated with the acquisition of the license for the correstore system 
we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets due to expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition 
table of contents of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash net tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of for the fiscal year ended november   we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets due to expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash net tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  for the fiscal year ended november   we recognized income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent on our statement of operations 
this income tax expense included a non cash tax expense on our statement of operations for fiscal of  in november  we wrote off our remaining correstore inventory of  based on the declining sales of correstore products and the uncertainty regarding future sales of these products 
results of operations fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues 
our net revenues increased  or percent  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in us sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in us sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of  or percent  primarily as a result of a percent increase in somasensor unit sales 
in addition  sales of the invos system monitor in the united states increased  or percent  primarily as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals  and an increase in international sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased purchases of the invos system monitor and disposable somasensor by covidien  formerly tyco healthcare  in europe  and increased purchases by edwards lifesciences in connection with the launch of our four channel cerebral and somatic invos system monitor in japan  partially for evaluation and demonstration purposes 
in fiscal  international sales represented percent of our net revenues  compared to percent of our net revenues in fiscal purchases by covidien accounted for percent of net revenues in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal in the united states  we sold  somasensors in fiscal  and internationally  we sold  we placed invos system monitors in the united states and internationally in fiscal  and our installed base of invos system monitors in the united states was  in hospitals  as of november  
table of contents sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended november  product somasensors invos system monitors total invos system correstore systems total gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and november  we realized a four percent increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states and increased sales of the invos system monitors to pediatric hospitals in the united states 
the increase in our average selling prices in the united states is attributable to increased sales of our pediatric somasensor  which sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a  initial fee under our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement entered into with neurophysics corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect our research  development and engineering expenses to increase in fiscal primarily as a result of development costs associated with advances to the design and performance features of the invos system  including the disposable somasensor  and the hiring of additional research and development personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november   primarily due to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and an increase in salaries of existing employees  an  increase in travel  marketing and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales personnel and increased sales and marketing activities  including sales training  product sponsorship  trade shows and advertising  an  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and hiring additional sales employees in fiscal a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal year financial performance  primarily increased sales and operating income in accordance with the incentive compensation plans  a  increase in stock compensation expense due to stock compensation issued to directors  officers  employees and a consultant in fiscal and  a  increase in clinical research expenses primarily as a result of a grant for neonatal research that we are supporting and a clinical trial we are sponsoring evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age  and a  increase in corporate insurance expenses due to increased coverage limits and increased premiums 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of fewer independent sales representative firms in fiscal we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal and  increased employee sales commissions payable 
table of contents as a result of increased sales  increased clinical research expense  increased stock compensation expenses  and increased sales and marketing expenses 
other income 
during fiscal  interest income increased to  from  in fiscal  primarily due to our increased cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investment balances as a result of cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from our public offering of common shares that closed in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased interest rates 
income taxes 
as of november   we recognized income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent on our statement of operations  and we expect this to continue for future periods 
as of november   we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  and increased our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
for fiscal  the reversal of our valuation allowance was net of recorded taxes 
the net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues

table of contents gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and percent for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a five percent increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states and increased sales of the invos system monitors to pediatric hospitals in the united states 
the increase in our average selling prices in the united states is attributable to increased sales of our pediatric somasensor  which sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor  and to the addition of new customers at our higher suggested retail prices 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by increased purchases of our four channel cerebral and somatic invos system monitor and disposable sensor by covidien  due to the lower margin we receive on sales to our distributors 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a  initial fee under our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement entered into with neurophysics corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares and cash provided by operating activities 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of november   we did not have any outstanding or available debt financing arrangements  we had working capital of million and our primary sources of liquidity were million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities and million of long term investments 
marketable securities and long term investments consist of aaa rated united states government agency bonds  and cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank savings accounts and money market accounts  pending their ultimate use 
on march   we completed a public offering of  of our newly issued common shares at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds  after deducting the underwriting discount and the expense of the offering  were  we entered into a contract development and exclusive licensing agreement with neurophysics corporation as of september  the agreement provides us with feasibility research  contract development and consulting services and certain ownership and licensing rights  subject to the rights of the united states federal government  to intellectual property and technical knowledge associated with several novel near infrared spectroscopy  or nirs  and imaging technologies and products under development at neurophysics 
we paid an initial license fee of  and have agreed to pay monthly license fees of up to  a month depending on which projects are continuing under development at neurophysics at the time for products continuing under development at neurophysics beginning april  and a royalty on future sales of the new products 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments on hand at november  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations during fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash was provided primarily by  of net income before income taxes and non cash depreciation  amortization and stock compensation expense  a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of the increased accrued incentive compensation and accrued sales commissions as a result of our fiscal financial performance  a  decrease in accrued income tax expense as a result of payments made in fiscal  and a  increase in accounts payable  primarily as a result of increased inventory and operating expenses  partially offset by more timely payments made to vendors 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was partially offset by a  increase in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal than in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the timing of more of the sales in fiscal towards the end of the fourth quarter  
table of contents a  increase in inventories  primarily due to the acquisition of components associated with our somasensors and our invos system monitor due to anticipated sales  partially offset by the  write down of our correstore inventory described above  inventories on our balance sheet decreased because we capitalized invos system monitors to property and equipment that are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment  as described below  a  increase in deferred income tax benefits as a result of payments made for estimated alternative minimum tax that we expect will result in future tax credits when we use our net operating loss carryforwards  a  increase in accrued interest income  primarily due to our increased cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investment balances  and increased interest rates  and a  increase in prepaid expenses  primarily as a result of prepaid costs associated with the construction of a new trade show booth 
we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 
the increase in inventories described above is greater than shown on our balance sheet because it includes invos system monitors that we capitalized because they are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment 
we capitalized  of costs from inventory for invos system monitors being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment at customers during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized  in costs for invos system monitors being used as demonstration and no capital cost sales equipment  and these assets have a net book value of  we depreciate these assets over five years

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or financing activities 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and requires an assessment of the probability of the validity of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns for recognition in financial statements 
only tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold of being sustained are recognized under fin fin also provides guidance on classification of interest and penalties and accounting and disclosures for annual and interim financial statements 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning december  the cumulative effect of the changes arising from the initial application of fin is required to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to our accounting treatment of stock compensation of employees  our accounting treatment for income taxes  and our revenue recognition associated with our no capital cost sales program 
stock compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  we adopted this statement for fiscal using a modified prospective application and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
we previously accounted for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and 
table of contents related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense was charged against income for fiscal for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
stock based compensation of consultants and advisors was determined based on the fair value of the options or warrants on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 estimated using the black scholes model 
the resulting amount was recognized as compensation expense and an increase in additional paid in capital over the vesting period of the options or warrants 
as a result  we recorded  of compensation expense  and an equal increase in additional paid in capital  for stock options vesting in favor of non employees in fiscal in november  we approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options as of november  the primary purpose of this accelerated vesting was to eliminate compensation expense we would recognize in our results of operations upon the adoption of sfas r  which was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  after the effects of the accelerated vesting  the initial adoption of sfas r was immaterial with respect to options granted before december  the issuance of additional stock compensation under the stock incentive plan in fiscal and had an impact on our financial statements 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees  directors and one of our officers  and we issued  restricted common shares to one of our officers 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our officers  employees  directors and one of our consultants  and we issued  restricted common shares to our officers 
these stock options and restricted shares were issued at the market price on the date of grant  and they vest and are expensed in the financial statements over five years 
as a result of the stock options and restricted common shares that we granted during fiscal and fiscal  we have recorded  in stock compensation expense in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
r 
as a result of the stock options and restricted common shares that we granted during fiscal  we recorded  in stock compensation expense in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
r 
as of november   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation awards granted under the plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of november   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation awards granted under the plan 
that cost was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
no modifications were made to any share awards that required an accounting charge  and no cash was paid for share based liabilities during fiscal or fiscal the fair value of the stock option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal and expected volatility the measure by which the stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during the period for  risk free rate approximate us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant of  expected lives of years  and a dividend yield of 
the fair value of the restricted common shares was estimated based on the market value of the common shares on the date of issuance 
different assumptions could significantly change the calculated grant date fair value  and  therefore  the amount of stock compensation expense we recognize over the vesting period of the awards 
we believe  however  that our estimates are appropriate 
during fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options that vested in fiscal using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of  or per diluted common share 
income taxes we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding realization of our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses over our history up to the most recent five fiscal years  and our forecast for future net income 

table of contents our assessment of our deferred tax assets included assuming that our net revenues and pre tax income will grow in future years consistent with the growth guidance given for fiscal and making allowance for the uncertainties surrounding  among other things  our future rate of growth in net revenues  the rate of adoption of our products in the marketplace  and the potential for competition to enter the marketplace 
as of november   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that approximately  of such assets will be realized 
the remaining tax benefits of  relating to stock option exercises will not be recognized on our financial statements until the reduce current taxes payable 
the benefit  when recognized  will increase additional paid in capital 
for the fiscal year ended november   we recorded income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent 
during fiscal  we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a net deferred tax asset of  related to the expected future benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during  we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of an additional net deferred tax asset of  for fiscal and  the reversal of our valuation allowance was net of recorded taxes 
for the fiscal year ended november   the recorded net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the fiscal year ended november   the recorded net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the effect of recognizing this asset on our balance sheet  and associated tax benefit on our statement of operations  is to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share  and to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
given the assumptions inherent in our financial plans  it is possible to calculate a different value for our deferred tax asset by changing one or more of the variables in our assessment 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our financial plans was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the plan were appropriate 
no capital cost sales revenue recognition we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the invos system monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the invos system monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years 
we believe this is consistent with our stated revenue recognition policy  which is compliant with staff accounting bulletin no 
 and we have considered emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables
