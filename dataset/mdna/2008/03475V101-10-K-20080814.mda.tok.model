overview we are a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd  and local oncology therapy options for treating cancer  including radiofrequency ablation rf or rfa and systems and embolization products for treating benign and malignant tumors 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  interventional and surgical oncologists and others to treat pvd  tumors  and other non coronary diseases 
we believe that we are the only company whose primary focus is to offer a comprehensive product line for the interventional treatment of these diseases 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollars in thousands interventional products oncology products total we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
as of may   our sales organization numbered in the us and outside the us for fiscal years   and  net sales in non us markets were  and  respectively 
the increase in our net sales attributable to non us sales is primarily as a result of the rita acquisition  completed in january our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
for each of the past three fiscal years  we invested at least of our net sales in research and development r d 
r d expenditures were of net sales for fiscal in  our r d expenditures were of net sales  however  a significant portion of those r d expenses in related to a charge of million for in process r d required under purchase accounting rules from our acquisition of rita 
excluding this charge  our r d expenses were approximately of net sales for fiscal we expect that our r d expenditures will reach approximately of net sales for fiscal we expect r d expenditures thereafter to continue to be in the range of to of net sales 
however  downturns in our business could cause us to reduce our r d spending 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we completed the acquisition of rita 
this acquisition creates a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat peripheral vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology is a large and growing area for our existing customer base and rita s leadership position  premium products and excellent reputation fit our strategy 
rita had a very strong position in vascular access ports  which are an ideal sales fit with our morpheus ct picc and the vascular access port technology we purchased from medron in may in addition  in may we acquired irreversible electroporation ire cellular resection technology  which we expect to commercialize in the second half of fiscal  which will be complementary to rita s diverse offering of local oncology therapies  including its market leading rfa systems  habib sealer tm resection devices and lc beads tm for tumor embolization 
in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and us assets of diomed  inc with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
except to the extent we can further use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared to for fiscal we intend to continue to manufacture more of these products in house to achieve lower product costs and increased profitability 
in and  we expanded our manufacturing facility in queensbury  new york  to provide us with significantly greater manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  development and administrative requirements 
we are not currently operating our manufacturing facilities at full capacity 
however  we anticipate requiring additional office space for additional engineering  marketing and administrative personnel in the near future 
our ability to further increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments acquisition of certain assets of diomed in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and us assets of diomed  inc for million subject to adjustment for changes in working capital to be determined subsequent to the closing date 
with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
acquisition of oncobionic  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of oncobionic  inc pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement entered into on october  the closing of the acquisition comes as a result of the successful initial use of oncobionic s irreversible electroporation ire technology in the first human clinical trial for the treatment of soft tissue  conducted during the first week of april under the stock purchase agreement  we agreed to pay a total purchase price of million  including  of assumed liabilities 
we made a payment of million upon the execution of the stock purchase agreement in october we paid million on may  upon the closing of the acquisition 
million is payable in november  and the remaining million is payable in november acquisition of rita medical systems  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of rita for a total purchase price of approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash  million shares of common stock  and assumption of outstanding rita options and other convertible securities  which are exercisable for an additional million shares of our common stock 
rita s operating results were consolidated with those of angiodynamics beginning on the date of the acquisition  january  since our results are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of rita  fluctuations in our operating results for as compared to the period are significantly impacted by the acquisition of rita 
we acquired rita for its market position  premium product offerings  developed and emerging technologies in the fields of interventional oncology and vascular access and its highly skilled workforce 
the merger was pursued and completed because the management groups and stockholders of angiodynamics and rita believed the combined entity would achieve higher sales and profitability than either or both of the pre merger companies on a standalone basis 
company reorganization beginning with our first fiscal quarter for the fiscal year ended may   we will organize our business into three divisions peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
our peripheral vascular division comprises our venous  angiographic  pta  drainage and thrombolytic product lines 
our access division comprises our dialysis  ports and picc lines 
our oncology surgery division comprises our rfa  embolization  habib and nanoknife product lines 
beginning with our quarterly report on form q for our fiscal quarter ended august   we will report our results of operations for these three divisions 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectibility are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title and risk of loss passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
for fiscal years   and  our write offs of accounts receivable have been insignificant 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax asset includes million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards remaining from the rita acquisition 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of rita s ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of remaining federal net operating losses and million of remaining state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
we need to generate approximately million of taxable income in each year over the next eighteen years to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing a combination of historical and projected results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering irc section limitations are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows million between and  million between and and million between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering remaining irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
r  transition election to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stock based payments that continue to be classified as equity awards 
additionally  we elected to use the long form method  as provided in paragraph of sfas no 
r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
the long form method requires us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 subject to adjustments for net operating loss carryforwards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires the company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company adopted this statement on june  there was no cumulative effect of adopting fin upon adoption  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was zero 
during the twelve months ended may   the company did not recognize any tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations as a component of income tax expense 
this accounting policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin accrued interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheet were as of june  and may  the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
fiscal years through remain open to examination by the various tax authorities 
the company analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income taxes  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions and believes that its income tax filings positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost on the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of may   june   and june   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between three and nineteen years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
we will test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
stock based compensation on june   the effective date we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in accordance with this method of adoption  prior period results of operations and financial position have not been restated to reflect the impact of stock based compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for options using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of apb no 
 and provided pro forma disclosure as allowed by statement no 
for  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  before tax  net of income taxes  or per diluted share as compared with when we recognized stock based compensation expense of  before tax  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
under the provisions of sfas r  we expect to recognize the following future expense for awards granted as of may  unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards issued subsequent to the adoption of sfas r on a straight line basis over the substantive vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we allocated the pro forma compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period using straight line attribution method 
we will continue to amortize compensation expense related to stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r using a straight line attribution method 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal years ended may  and june   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation under sfas r and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
black scholes was also previously used for our pro forma information required by sfas for periods prior to june  the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we consider historical volatility and trends within our industry peer group when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is determined using the simplified method available under sab due to our limited public history 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
we have not paid dividends in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our historical data includes information from may   the date of our initial public offering 
results of operations our fiscal years ended may   june   and june   represent fifty two weeks  fifty two weeks  and fifty three weeks  respectively 
our operating results for fiscal   and are expressed as a percentage of total net sales in the following table

a significant amount of the expenses we incurred in related to the acquisition of rita and were outside the normal course of our operations as a stand alone company 
as required under the rules of purchase accounting  these expenses included an in process r d charge of million that carries with it no income tax benefit  amortization expense of  on the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and  of reduced gross margin as a result of the step up in basis and subsequent sale of finished goods inventory we acquired 
additionally  we incurred non capitalizable integration and restructuring costs of  these costs aggregated  net of income taxes of  for both and  we were able to use net operating losses nols accumulated by rita to offset the amount of cash we paid for federal and state income taxes 
the cash benefit amounted to approximately and million for the years ended may  and june   respectively 
according to the rules of purchase accounting  we are unable to use acquired nols to offset our provision for income taxes in the statements of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and june  net sales 
net sales are derived from the sale of our products and related freight charges  less discounts and returns 
for fiscal  net sales increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of products acquired in the rita transaction for all of fiscal compared to fiscal which only included rita product sales from the date of the acquisition  january  until the end of the fiscal year 
rita products accounted for million or of the fiscal sales as compared with million or of the fiscal sales 
our sales growth was driven by recently released products including the new smart port ct  morpheus ct picc insertion kit  profiler balloon catheter  the total abscession tm drainage catheter  and sotradecol tm 
net sales to non us markets for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of vascular access ports and oncology products

for fiscal  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to from for fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of higher margin products  including the rita products and others such as the morpheus ct picc  the venacure procedure kit  and the total abscession tm drainage catheter  partially offset by increased sales of sotradecol  which carries a lower gross margin 
gross profit in also included product efficiencies from the successful integration of rita which were partially offset by costs associated with the start up of new product production and increases to inventory reserves due to continued focus on product line optimization 
gross profit in was also reduced by basis points for the amortization of the step up in basis and subsequent sale of finished goods inventory we acquired in the rita acquisition 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products and register  maintain and defend our intellectual property 
for fiscal  r d expenses decreased million  or  to million compared to million for fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the impact of the million for in process r d related to the rita acquisition in fiscal this decrease was offset by expenses associated with the addition of rita engineering personnel in fremont  california and manchester  georgia along with increased engineering personnel and activities in queensbury  new york

g a expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal while the expense increased year over year  primarily due to increased stock based compensation and travel and administrative costs associated with our recent acquisition and integration activities  g a expenses decreased as a percentage of sales 
this decrease  from of net sales for fiscal to of net sales for fiscal  is primarily due to synergies achieved in the integration of rita 
we spent approximately million in fiscal in litigation costs associated with the vnus medical and diomed lawsuits 
at may   we employed people in general and administrative activities compared with people at june   of which were added due to the rita acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal litigation provision

other income expenses 
other income expenses includes interest income  realized gains and losses from the sales of marketable securities  changes in fair value of an interest rate swap and interest expense

to secure this financing  we entered into agreements with local municipalities  a bank  a trustee and a remarketing agent 
these agreements are referred to as the ida agreements 
the proceeds of the bonds were advanced as construction occurred 
the bonds reprice every seven days and are resold by a remarketing agent 
the bonds bear interest based on the market rate on the date the bonds are repriced and require quarterly principal payments ranging from  to  plus accrued interest through may we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank to convert the initial variable rate payments to a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the ida agreements contain financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage and interest coverage 
the outstanding debt is collateralized by a letter of credit million at may  and a first mortgage on the land  building and equipment comprising our facility in queensbury  and we are required to pay an annual fee ranging from to of the outstanding balance depending on our financial results

the swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating interest rate payments for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts

amounts borrowed under the reimbursement agreement are collateralized by the aforementioned letter of credit and all of our assets 
the debt covenants and the collateralization of substantially all of our assets to secure these financings may restrict our ability to obtain debt financing in the future 
in connection with the acquisition of rita on january   we assumed subordinated senior convertible notes the convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share of common stock  net of a cash component  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including common stock splits or other standard anti dilution provisions

if the closing price does not meet this condition  then the debt will be paid in cash 
the entire principal amount has been classified as current portion of long term debt and convertible note in our consolidated balance sheet as of may  on may   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of oncobionic  inc pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement entered into on october  the closing of the acquisition comes as a result of the successful initial use of oncobionic s irreversible electroporation ire technology in the first human clinical trial for the treatment of soft tissue  conducted during the first week of april under the stock purchase agreement  we agreed to pay a total purchase price of million  including  of assumed liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into interest rate swaps with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change market risk on our variable interest rate financings  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
at may   we maintained variable interest rate financings of million in connection with our facility expansions 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with a bank under which we agreed to pay the bank a fixed annual interest rate and the bank assumed our variable interest payment obligations under the financings 
nearly all of our sales have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
although not significant  in late fiscal we began to make sales in other currencies  particularly the euro  gb pound and canadian dollar 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange risk and such risk in the future is expected to be modest 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities primarily of less than two years 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
as of may   we were exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to our investments in auction rate securities  us government corporation and agency obligations in the amount of million 
the bonds bear interest at a floating rate established weekly 
each basis point or fluctuation in interest rates will increase or decrease interest income on the bonds by approximately  on an annual basis 
we hold investments in auction rate securities in order to generate higher than typical money market investments 
the amount held in these securities was million as of may  auction rate securities typically are high credit quality  generally achieved with municipal bond insurance 
credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers  which back a majority of this market 
although rare  sell orders for any security traded through an auction process could exceed bids 
such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issue credit quality 
should there be a failed auction  we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term 
we are party to legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business as described in note q to the consolidated financial statements
