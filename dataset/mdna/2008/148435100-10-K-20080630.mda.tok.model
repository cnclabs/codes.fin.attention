item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop and market premium branded spirits in several growing market categories  including vodka  rum  whiskey  tequila and liqueurs  and we distribute these spirits in all us states and the district of columbia  in nine key international markets  including ireland  great britain  northern ireland  germany  canada  france  bulgaria  russia and the duty free markets  and in a number of other countries in continental europe 
the brands we market include  among others  boru vodka  gosling s rum  clontarf irish whiskey  knappogue castle whiskey  jefferson s  jefferson s reserve and sam houston bourbons and the pallini liqueurs 
our current growth strategy focuses on a aggressive brand development to encourage case sale and revenue growth of our existing portfolio of brands through significant investment in sales and marketing activities  including advertising  promotion and direct sales personnel expense  and b the selective addition of complementary premium brands through a combination of strategic initiatives  including acquisitions  joint ventures and long term exclusive distribution arrangements 
change in operational emphasis we are shifting emphasis from a volume oriented approach to a profit centric focus 
we will do so by adopting strategies and tactics to address the following revenue growth from the company s existing brands revenue growth from new brands acquired via agency relationships revenue growth from brands created to address as yet unsatisfied market needs 
the organic growth of existing brands will be supported by a variety of sales and marketing initiatives 
the first is recognition of the most profitable brands with re focused concentration and emphasis upon sales of those brands 
our wholesaler relationships are critical to this effort and we are embarking upon an effort to improve and strengthen these relationships 
the result will be an improvement in the penetration of both the on and off premise markets 
our marketing efforts will utilize a viral approach  wherein we use the internet and various focused media campaigns to attract consumer interest and takedown of our brands 
we will also be employing the use of leverage in this aspect of our business as we benefit from the organizational strength of the partners we select to participate in our various internet marketing activities as well as joint brand development activities 
we are seeking additional agency relationships to round out our brand portfolio 
we have developed specific criteria that we are employing in our determination of acceptability of certain brands 
by using these criteria  we improve the likelihood of selecting brands that will continue our track record that has been established of growing brands rapidly 
we recently announced the creation of a new tequila brand  tierras 
this brand has been developed to satisfy the underserved market for organic spirits 
we will continue to identify underserved markets and develop new products to serve them 
we are completing the restructuring of our international sales and distribution systems  and are now poised to resume growth in our international markets 
several of our brands are in attractive growth categories internationally  and we intend to grow them via the development of an intensified network of distributors in desirable markets 

table of contents cost containment we have taken significant steps over the past six months to bring our costs down 
these steps included a restructuring of the international operations  a restructuring of the gosling castle partnership working relationship and the elimination of unnecessary cost from the us organization 
the next step in the process of managing costs is a rigorous application of effort to the entire supply function of our brands 
we are examining each step of the process of sourcing our brands to both improve quality and reduce cost 
in turn  this process examination will be followed by attention to our systems of work  with the goal of mapping  analyzing and redesigning these systems 
strategic transactions a review and understanding of our historical growth during the past fiscal years should consider the timing of our strategic transactions 
these transactions for our company and our predecessor companies are outlined below 
in addition to the impact of these transactions  we have had significant growth in our own brands and will continue to focus on developing those brands 
roaring water bay acquisition 
on december   in connection with our acquisition of the roaring water bay spirits group limited and the roaring water bay spirits company gb limited and their related entities  referred to collectively as roaring water bay  we added the boru vodka  clontarf irish whiskeys and brady s irish cream brands to our portfolio 
while we were already selling boru vodka in the united states pursuant to the distribution agreement  the acquisition added significant boru vodka sales internationally  principally in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
this acquisition is reflected in our financial results for the last four months of our fiscal year ended march  and in all subsequent periods 
pallini liqueur distribution agreement 
on august   we signed an exclusive us marketing and distribution agreement for the pallini liqueurs 
sales of those products are reflected in our results for the fiscal year ended march   commencing as of august  and in all subsequent periods 
gosling s rum distribution agreement 
on january   we signed an exclusive us distribution agreement for the gosling s rums 
gosling s rum sales are reflected in our financial results for the last three months of the fiscal year ended march  and in all subsequent periods 
gosling castle partners export venture 
on february   we reached agreement to expand our gosling s relationship by acquiring a interest in a newly formed global export venture with the gosling family  now named gosling castle partners  inc  that had been formed to acquire  through an export agreement  the exclusive distribution rights for gosling s rums worldwide  except for the gosling s home market of bermuda  including an assignment to such venture of the gosling s rights under our january distribution agreement 
this export agreement became effective on april  the financial results of gosling castle partners are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing as of our february purchase of such interest  with adjustments for minority interest  how ever  it had no meaningful operations prior to the april  commencement of the export agreement 
mclain kyne acquisition 
on october   as a result of our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of mclain kyne  ltd f k a mclain kyne distillery  ltd  we added mclain kyne s premium small batch bourbons to our portfolio jefferson s  jefferson s reserve and sam houston 
the financial results of this acquisition are included in our financial statements commencing october  and in all subsequent periods 
tequila tierras autenticas de jalisco on february   we entered into an agreement with autentica tequilera to develop and launch a new brand of super premium tequila  tequila tierras autenticas de jalisco or tierras 
castle brands will be the exclusive importer and marketer of tierras in the united states 
tierras  which will be the signature brand of autentica tequilera and will launch later this year  will be available as blanco  reposado and a ejo and is expected to be available for sale in the us in september 

table of contents operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our premium spirits to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state owned agencies  which  in turn  distribute our premium brands to retail outlets 
a number of factors affect our overall level of sales  including the number of cases sold  revenue per case  relative contribution by brand and geographic mix 
changes in any of these factors may have a material impact on overall sales 
we introduced the new boru vodka bottle design in april in the us and in the international markets in september during fiscal  and continuing in fiscal  we launched an advertising campaign that featured our new bottle design for boru vodka 
this represents a significant upgrade in packaging and brings the product more in line with its brand positioning 
in the united states  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import duties  which are also reflected in a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the united states 
our sales typically peak during the months of october through december in anticipation of  and during  the holiday season 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future rendering quarter to quarter comparisons unreliable as indicators of performance 
the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we are able to sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differ by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain of our products  such as the gosling s rums and pallini liqueurs  as finished goods 
for other products  we purchase the components of our products  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the united states than elsewhere 
selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is currently high compared to our competitors because of our brand development  level of marketing spend and our established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that our strategy of building an infrastructure capable of supporting our anticipated future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
in anticipation of continuing growth  we have added the following components that are included in selling costs

spacer

spacer 
gif 
hiring of a highly qualified and experienced sales force  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
continuous improvement of our product distribution network and forging of strong distributor relationships beyond those a company of our size might be expected to maintain  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
implementation of a products depletion tracking system  by both brand and sku enabling us to more effectively target our selling efforts 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to continue to increase in the coming years  we also expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to continue to decline  as our volumes expand and we employ our direct sales team over a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support our operations 
these expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
while we expect these expenses to increase on an absolute basis as our sales volumes continue to increase and we add additional personnel  we also expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to continue to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to significantly increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain liquidity and manage our working capital and 
table of contents overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to be able to take advantage of these opportunities and to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we believe continued investment in marketing and advertising to broaden customer awareness and the hiring of salespeople to provide greater coverage of key geographic regions is important to the improvement of operations 
these efforts will lead to sizable increases in our absolute level of selling expense and it is uncertain as to whether the investment will translate into increased customer brand recognition for our spirits and therefore greater case sales 
given the competitive nature of the spirits industry and the existence of well established brands in each spirits category  we expect to incur increased competition from existing and new competitors as we achieve greater case sales and market share 
we believe a number of industry dynamics and trends will create growth opportunities for us to broaden our spirits portfolio and increase our case sales  including

the continued consolidation of brands among the major spirits companies is expected to result in their divestiture of non core brands  which may create an opportunity for us as we focus on smaller and emerging brands  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the ongoing industry consolidation is expected to make it more difficult for spirits companies and new entrants to secure an attractive route to market  particularly in the united states  while we already have established extensive us and international distribution  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
owners of small private and family owned spirits brands will seek to partner with or be acquired by a larger company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
particular opportunities in the premium end of the spirits market in which we participate  given positive changes in customer preferences  demographics and expected growth rates in the imported spirits segments 
our growth strategy is based upon partnering with existing brands  acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of contacts in the industry 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
with respect to foreign and small private and family owned spirits brands  we will continue to be flexible and creative in the structure and form of our proposals and present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
we also believe there will be growth opportunities for us as a result of the expected growth rates in the imported spirits segments in which we compete 
given the historical and projected growth rates for the imported spirits industry  and the imported vodka and imported rum segments in particular  we are expecting growth in case sales for all of our product categories 
the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships will require significant management attention and time commitment 
there is uncertainty concerning our ability to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and whether we will complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
to address the uncertainty regarding potential acquisition candidates  we plan to rely on  and continue to grow  our extensive network of industry contacts to help us identify and evaluate spirits products with growth potential 
we plan to rely on our management team s extensive experience in the spirits industry to successfully integrate any products we acquire and  when appropriate  hire additional personal 

table of contents financial performance overview the following table sets forth certain information regarding our case sales for the fiscal years ending march   and the data in the following table are based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard spirits industry metric

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally upon shipment to a distributor or to a control state entity  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the united states until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel 

table of contents accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
as of march  and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets that arose from acquisitions were and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or  more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined at march  by weighting a combination of the present value of the company s discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
such valuations resulted in the company recording a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million for the year ended march  sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  applying the modified prospective method 
prior to april   we accounted for stock options according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  and therefore no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value 
compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in the year ended march  includes respective amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option 
table of contents awards granted prior to april  over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and respective amortization related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
a compensation charge is recorded when it is probable that performance or service conditions will be satisfied 
the probability of vesting is updated annually and compensation is adjusted via a cumulative catch up adjustment or prospectively depending upon the nature of the change 
under the modified prospective transition method  prior period results have not been restated 
stock based compensation for the years ended march  and was million and million  respectively 
we used the black sholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during the years ended march   and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our financial statements

fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
revenues per case increased 
table of contents as part of our overall pricing strategy 
our increase in net sales also reflects the inclusion of excise and vat in sales to our distributor in ireland 
historically  our sales in ireland have been made in bond  net of excise taxes 
in september and again in march  we made sales to our distributor in ireland ex bond that included million and million  respectively  in excise taxes and vat 
this increase in excise and vat in sales to our distributor in ireland was offset by a change in route to market in the united kingdom where we now sell in bond 
this change resulted in a decrease of million in excise and vat taxes 
these taxes are reflected in both our revenues and cost of sales as an equal increase to both 
international case sales volume was negatively impacted primarily by our transition to a new distributor in the republic of ireland as well as the timing of reorders in connection with price increases and the relaunch of boru

while we anticipate a resolution to the underlying issues  including the possible appointment of a new distributor  will be reached in the near term  the adverse impact on our international sales is expected to continue at least through our next two fiscal quarters 
we recognize that foreign exchange volatility is a reality for an international company as exchange rates can distort the underlying growth of our business both positively and negatively 
to quantify the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations  we have translated current year results at prior year rates

depletions are shipments from wholesale distributors to retail customers  and are commonly regarded in the industry as an approximate measure of consumer demand 
wholesalers typically order products from us based on their current inventory and anticipated depletions  and may periodically seek to adjust their carried inventory 
as our products have gained acceptance in the marketplace  our wholesale distributors have increasingly been placing orders for direct imports  which are full container orders shipped directly to the wholesaler  instead of first being held by us or our agents at a bonded warehouse 
while increases in direct imports are typically viewed as an increasing sign of health for our brands  they may periodically result in periodic swings in orders for our products 
we have engaged an outside company  dimensional insights  to track and provide us with depletion data 
table of contents measuring the sales from our distributors to their retail customers in order to monitor depletion data  which generally demonstrates consumer purchases of our products  which is measured in smaller increments than distributor orders and therefore a more consistent reporting metric 
as the data has been reported to us  us depletions of our products reflect a growth of our entire portfolio in the year ended ended march  as compared to same period last year 
we realized significant increases in boru vodka of  whiskies net of our bourbon line acquired in october of and our liqueurs of 
while the depletion growth of our rums was small relative to the balance of the rest of our portfolio  it was still above the relative growth of our competitive set 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period  and our gross margin decreased to during the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
during the year ended march   we recorded net allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million 
we recorded this allowance on both raw materials and finished goods  primarily in connection with our repackaging of boru vodka in march and our launch of the new clontarf packaging in march in addition  in an effort to refocus our efforts on our faster growing and more profitable skus and bottle sizes  we are reducing the number of skus and bottle sizes available for sale on some of our other products  primarily gosling s rums 
in march of  we were able to recover million of the charge via a return of some goods to the supplier 
the net million charge has been recorded as an increase to cost of sales in the current year and has a significant negative effect on our reported gross profit and gross margin 
as detailed above  in september and again in march  we made sales to our distributor in ireland ex bond that included million and million  respectively  in excise taxes and vat 
while the inclusion of million dollars in both revenues and cost of sales has no net effect in gross profit  the inclusion did have a negative effect on our gross margin  purely as a mathematical consequence of increasing the denominator in the calculation 
the gross margin decline also reflects the higher cost of sales due to increased raw material costs and the effects of a weakening us dollar against the euro on our euro based supply contracts and an unfavorable geographic and brand mix shift for the twelve month period 
we recognize that foreign exchange volatility is a reality for an international company as exchange rates can distort the underlying growth of our business both positively and negatively 
to quantify the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations  we have translated current year results at prior year rates 
the weakening dollar vis vis the euro and the british pound also positively impacted our gross profit by when translating current year results at prior year exchange rates 
selling expense 
selling expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
this continued increase in selling expense was largely attributable to a combination of increased employee salaries and benefits in connection with our effort to strengthen our sales and marketing team of million  and the timing of certain advertising promotional programs  including increases in distributor incentives and sales support costs of million 
in addition  we took a charge of million on sales and marketing materials made obsolete by our new boru and clontarf packaging 
the increase of these costs was offset in part by a reduction in our marketing expense of million 
stock based compensation expense attributable to sales and m arketing personnel remained flat at million for the year ended march  when compared to the comparable prior period 
as a result of the foregoing  selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
in february  consistent with our new approach to our international markets and overall cost savings previously described  we restructured our international operations to reduce overhead costs 
these savings will be realized effective with our fiscal year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 

table of contents this decrease in general and administrative expense was in part attributable to a decrease in professional fees of million and a decrease in compensation expense of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
these decreases were offset by an increase to capital based taxes  investor relations and printing charges of million 
as a result of the foregoing  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization remained flat at million in the fiscal year ended march   compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
goodwill impairment 
under sfas  the fair value of each of our reporting units was determined at march  by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
the valuations resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million for the year ended march  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
the major components of this category include a change in foreign exchange  net interest income expense and minority interest 
foreign exchange gain during the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to a gain of million in the comparable prior period 
the current period gain is attributable to the effects of the strengthening of the euro and the british pound against the dollar on our intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
interest income during the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to million in the comparable prior period  reflecting the use of funds from the investment of less of the proceeds of our initial public offering in april and our private placement in may interest expense during the fiscal year ended march  was million  unchanged from the comparable prior period 
minority interest during the fiscal year ended march  amounted to a credit of million as compared to a credit of million in the comparable prior period as a result of a reduced loss recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc net loss attributable to common stockholders 
as a result of the foregoing  including the million impairment to goodwill described above  the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million in the comparable prior period 
net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued in our private placement financing closed in may of total stock based compensation expense was million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the comparable prior period 
ebitda 
as a result of the foregoing ebitda decreased to negative million for the year ended march  versus negative million the comparable prior period 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense including expensing of deferred financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the impact of the non cash charge for stock based compensation reported under sfas r 
we use ebitda as the primary internal management measure for evaluating performance on a period over period analysis  when comparing actual results to budgeted performance and when allocating additional resources 
this non gaap financial measure is presented in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity  our ability to incur and serv ice debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
unlike net income  ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of 
table of contents capital 
we compensate for these limitations by using ebitda as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including interest payments  debt principal repayments  and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in ebitda 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth our reconciliation of ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable financial measure

 fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
there was no material change in the selling prices of our existing products 
our increase in net sales reflects an increase in overall case sales  primarily from existing brands 
the weakening dollar vis vis the euro and the british pound also positively impacted our net sales as our international sales which are denominated in euros and british pounds translated to us dollars at a higher rate 
however  some of these net sales gains were offset by reduced net sales from direct imports into the us  whereby federal excise taxes are paid directly by the distributor  resulting in lower revenue per case 
in addition  vodka case sales  which have a lower rev enue per case than most of our other brands  were a larger percentage of overall case sales in the fiscal year ended march  than the comparable prior period  also resulting in a lower net sales growth 
our case sales  measured in nine liter case equivalents  increased  cases  or to  cases versus the comparable prior period  resulting in our largest year of sales to date 
our us case sales as a percentage of total case sales increased to during the fiscal year ended march  from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects the momentum of our portfolio in the us  particularly for boru vodka  gosling s rums and the pallini liqueurs 

table of contents the table below presents the increase or decrease  as applicable  in our case sales by product category for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
current period whiskey case sales include sales of bourbon products following our acquisition of mclain kyne on october  in fiscal  we elected to discontinue sales of a low margin irish cream  which resulted in a decrease in the sales of liqueurs 
a decrease in the liqueur sales in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year was offset by increases in case sales of our other brands  particularly boru vodka  which sales increased in the us and overall from the prior fiscal year  primarily attributable to the launch of the new packaging in the us  resulting in increased sales orders to fill distributor inventories  and by sales of newly acquired premium single batch bourbon brands following our acquisition of mclain kyne on october

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period  while our gross margin decreased to during the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the absolute increase in gross profit reflected our increased level of sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage reflects a shift in product mix and increased growth of some of the lower margin products  including shifts in both brands and sizes 
our margins are lower on vodka  which was a greater portion of overall case sales in the fiscal year ended march  than in the comparable prior period 
in addition  since the majority of our production is still billed in euros  we were adversely affected by the weakening dollar vis vis the euro 
selling expense

these public company costs include increases in professional fees and public company directors and officers liability insurance of million  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition to increased compensation for existing personnel  we hired several new employees  resulting in an increase in compensation expense of million 
we also adopted sfas  share based payment on april   which resulted in stock based compensation expense attributable to personnel other than those in sales and marketing of million in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the foregoing  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior year period

minority interest during the fiscal year ended march  amounted to a credit of million as compared to a credit of million in the comparable prior period as a result of a larger loss recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million in the comparable prior period 
net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued and converted in our initial public offering 
as previously discussed  we adopted sfas r  share based payment on april   which resulted in total stock based compensation expense of million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to none in the comparable prior period 
the net loss per common share included million of preferred stock dividends accrued during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the comparable prior period 
ebitda 
ebitda decreased to negative million for the year ended march  versus negative million the comparable prior period 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense including expensing of deferred financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and the impact of the non cash charge for stock based compensation reported under sfas r 
we use ebitda as the primary internal management measure for evaluating performance on a period over period analysis  when comparing actual results to budgeted performance and when allocating additional resources 
this non gaap financial measure is presented in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity  our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirem ents 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
unlike net income  ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital 
we compensate for these limitations by using ebitda as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including interest payments  debt principal repayments  and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in ebitda 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comp arable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents the following table sets forth our reconciliation of ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable financial measure

 potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future rendering quarter to quarter comparisons unreliable as indicators of performance 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters concluding with the quarter ended march  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued and converted in our initial public offering and our private placement in may liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred significant operating and net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
in addition  we have million in principal of our senior notes due on may  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in the past  we have been able to obtain financing to fund our losses 
we expect to seek additional capital through the sale of debt and or equity in fiscal in order to fund our operating and capital needs  although there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
in june we engaged an investment banking firm to advise us in connection with the evaluation of various prospective transactions  including the raising of additional equity from prospective investors  and the evaluation of the potential sale of one or more assets 
our ability to continue is dependent on obtaining additional long term financing and ultimately achieving profitable operating results 
as a result  the report of our independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory 
table of contents paragraph referring to an uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern 
please see note  to our financial statements for the year ended march  as of march   we had stockholders equity of million and working capital of million as compared to million and million  respectively  at march  these amounts as of march  are primarily the result of our may private placement  which raised net proceeds of million upon the sale of  common shares at the offering price of per share reduced by our operating losses  including a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the proceeds have been and will continue to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  sales and marketing activities 
our balance of cash equivalents and short term investments was million at march  as compared to million at march  our balance of cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million in may as a result of the closing of a million private placement of common stock and warrants sold to certain institutional investors 
the net proceeds of the private placement were million  after giving effect to the placement fee of million 
in addition  at march   we had approximately million of cash restricted from withdrawal and held by a bank in ireland as collateral for a line of credit and creditors insurance 
the following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to mid term

expansion into new markets and within existing markets in the united states and internationally 
we expect that we will require increasing amounts of working capital to finance our inventory levels in the united states 
except for gosling s rums  which are bottled in the united states  all of our products are imported from europe 
in the case of our wholly owned brands  there is a three to four month production and shipping lead time between the time of order placement and the time the product is available for sale 
this lead time has required us to ensure that we maintain sufficient inventories to properly service our customers 
we expect to experience a lengthening of the revenue collection cycle due to the need to extend payment terms as an incentive to encourage customers to make container sized purchases of our products on which title passes to the customer at the shipping point in ireland 
a lengthening of the revenue collection cycle will require a significant amount of working capital 
hiring of financial advisor in may  we engaged miller buckfire co

impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal  or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are assessing the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position fsp b  effective date of fasb statement no 
 that would permit a one year deferral in applying the measurement provisions of statement no 
to non financial assets and non financial liabilities non financial items that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
therefore  if the change in fair value of a non financial item is not required to be recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on an annual basis or more frequently  the effective date of application of statement to that item is deferred until fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this deferral does not apply  however  to an entity that applies statement in interim or annual financial statements before proposed fsp b is fina lized 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of b will have on the company s operating income or net earnings 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities would be recognized in earnings when they occur 
sfas further establishes certain additional disclosure requirements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact and timing of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
statement no 
r is required to be adopted concurrently with statement no 
and is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or 
table of contents after december  early adoption is prohibited 
application of statement no 
r and statement no 
is required to be adopted prospectively  except for certain provisions of statement no 
 which are required to be adopted retrospectively 
business combination transactions accounted for before adoption of statement no 
r should be accounted for in accordance with statement no 
and that accounting previously completed under statement no 
should not be modified as of or after the date of adoption of statement no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the impact of statement no 
r and statement no 
 but do not expect the adoption of these pronouncements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of march   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial or commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosure about fair value of financial investments 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
we do participate in certain foreign exchange currency future contracts programs to limit our risk and the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our product costs 
when placing a product order  we attempt to lock in its cost by buying forward contracts on euros coinciding with the projected payment dates for such purchases 
individual forward contracts rarely extend for more than six months or exceed  
depending upon the term of the contract  the cost of these transactions can vary between approximately to basis points 
as of march   the company had no forward contracts outstanding
