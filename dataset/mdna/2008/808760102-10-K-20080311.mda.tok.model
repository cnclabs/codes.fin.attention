item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop and distribute the fast forword family of software 
our patented products build learning capacity by rigorously and systematically applying neuroscience based learning principles to improve the fundamental cognitive skills required to read and learn 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  school districts and our company demonstrates the rapid and lasting gains achieved through fast forword participation 
our products are marketed primarily to k schools in the us  to whom we sell through a direct sales force 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
since our inception  learners have used our fast forword products over one million times and approximately  schools have purchased at least  of our fast forword product licenses and services 
as of december  we had full time equivalent employees  compared to at december  on january   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of soliloquy learning  including the reading assistant product  for million in cash 
the scientific learning reading assistant combines advanced speech recognition technology with scientifically based courseware to help students strengthen fluency  vocabulary and comprehension to become proficient life long readers 
business highlights we market our fast forword products primarily as a reading intervention solution for struggling  at risk  english language learners  and special education students 
approximately of the estimated million public and private school k students in the united states test as not proficient in reading 
while our installed base is growing  the approximately  schools that have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services represent a small fraction of the approximately  k schools in the us 
federal education funds are a critical resource in helping school districts address the needs of the most challenged learners 
we believe that a significant proportion of our sales are funded by federal sources  particularly title one and idea special education grants 
in fiscal  these programs are projected to total billion 
states are forecasting shortfalls in their taxation revenues for fiscal because of the existing housing slump and a potential recession in the nationwide economy 
such shortfalls would have an impact on education spending  although it is likely that education would remain among the top priorities 
sales of our products are included in the growing supplemental education materials segment of the overall education materials market 
simba information s publishing for the prek market april estimates that the total market for k instructional materials is billion  growing at the supplemental materials segment of that market is billion the fastest growing supplemental market  technology based electronic courseware  is million and expected to grow company highlights in total revenue increased by compared to this compares to an increase of in compared to we attribute our revenue increase primarily to our improved sales capacity resulting from additional sales representatives hired in who became productive in a continued focus within our sales organization on quickly closing transactions over  and on increasing the size of these transactions 
booked sales increased in compared to revenue increased at a slower rate than booked sales because in our sales mix contained a greater proportion of multiple year service and support offerings  where a significant amount of revenue is to be recognized in future periods  as compared to previous years 
for more explanation of booked sales  see booked sales and selling activity  below 
we also experienced continued growth in our international sales  which increased in compared to  following an increase of in compared to in  international sales comprised approximately page of total sales  compared to in we conduct our international business through value added representatives vars 
at december  we had vars selling in countries 
we reported net income of million in  compared to net income of million in the increase in net income is primarily due to an income tax benefit of approximately million arising from the reduction of a portion of our deferred taxation valuation allowance 
during we introduced our reading progress indicator service 
while we are pleased with the initial results  the incremental revenue from this additional offering was not significant in we ended with million in cash and cash equivalents  and had no outstanding debt 
we did not make use of our credit line during net cash generated from operating activities was million 
in january we completed the acquisition of the soliloquy reading assistant product line and substantially all of the other assets of the soliloquy learning business  based in waltham  massachusetts  for cash consideration of million 
we estimate that as a direct result of this acquisition our revenue and our operating expenses in will increase 
results of operations revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products service and support total revenues revenue compared to product revenues  which comprise the majority of our revenue  increased modestly in compared to the growth in product revenues was slower than total revenues due to lower than expected product sales  and an increase in multiple year service and support packages which include a lower proportion of product revenue 
in one customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
on average of booked sales in were recognized into revenue in the quarter in which the sale occurred 
our service and support revenue increased significantly in compared to due to more services delivered and a higher number of schools on support 
at december  we had approximately more schools on support than at december  the increase in schools on support is mainly due to our success in selling renewals to our growing installed base 
revenue compared to product revenue declined in compared to because we recognized approximately million less revenue from sales made in prior periods 
this decrease was almost offset by increased revenue recognized on sales booked in on average of booked sales in were recognized into revenue in the quarter in which the sale occurred 
service and support revenue increased in by  primarily due to stronger sales of on site services  partially offset by a lower level of revenue recognized from sales made in prior years 
service and support revenue also reflected the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support contracts 
we had more customers on support at december  than at december booked sales and selling activity booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if any of the requirements to recognize revenue are not met  the sale is booked to deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from revenue  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
page the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the twelve months ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales less revenue net increase decrease in deferred revenue total deferred revenue end of period booked sales in the k sector  which accounted for over of booked sales in  increased to million compared to million in booked sales in the k sector were million in we believe that the principal reasons for the increase in booked sales are our improved sales capacity resulting from additional sales representatives hired in who became productive in we had an average of quota bearing sales representatives in  compared to in a continued focus within our sales organization on quickly closing transactions over  and on increasing the size of these transactions 
our sales included one transaction for approximately million 
the increase in booked sales in was smaller than the increase that we experienced in the large increase in was mainly because sales in in several key states had been depressed due to severe weather conditions  spiking energy prices  and other factors that contributed to general funding uncertainty 
we believe large booked sales are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales  and we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in and in although we closed fewer large deals in than in  the average size of these transactions increased substantially  from approximately  in to approximately  in the increase in average transaction size was mainly due to the impact of one transaction for approximately million 
for the year ended december   of our k booked sales were realized from sales over  for the comparable periods ending december  and  large booked sales accounted for and of booked sales respectively 
large booked sales include volume discounts but the percentage discount applicable to any given transaction will vary and the relative percentage of large sales and smaller sales in a given quarter may fluctuate 
because we discount product license fees but do not discount service and support fees  product booked sales and revenue are disproportionately affected by discounting 
we cannot predict the size  number and timing of large transactions in the future 
booked sales outside the k market primarily to the adult corrections market  private practice clinicians and international customers increased by in compared to  mainly due to the impact of a large corrections sale 
international sales increased by in compared to non k sales in were flat relative to although federal  state and local budget pressures make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we are optimistic about our growth prospects in the k market 
however  achieving our booked sales growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control including the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
for a discussion of some of the other important factors that affect our results  see risk factors 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
see management s discussion and analysis application of page critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin improved slightly in compared to the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by increased service and support margins  partially offset by a reduction in the proportion of higher margin product revenue 
service and support revenue growth of  combined with an increase in service and support costs  resulted in an increase in the service and support gross margin from to 
the main reasons for the increase in service and support gross margin were higher staff utilization and leverage from our new tucson support center 
higher margin product revenues comprised of total revenues in compared to in the overall gross profit margin declined in compared to  as a small improvement in product margin was more than offset by a substantial decrease in services and support margin 
product margins improved primarily because capitalized software amortization  which was charged to product cost of revenue  ceased in june we also reduced costs by limiting the quantity of electronic media that we send to customers 
service and support margins declined from to primarily due to our investment in a new support center in tucson  arizona  which replaced an outside vendor 
we also hired additional service staff in anticipation of increased service sales 
operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
the increase in sales and marketing costs in compared to is mostly due to higher employee costs  as headcount has increased by year over year  and also to increased spending on marketing initiatives such as trade shows and the use of marketing consultants  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation costs 
in  our sales and marketing expenses increased over  primarily due to increased sales and marketing staff  more marketing activities and higher commissions reflecting higher booked sales 
commissions in were million higher than in at december   we had field based quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools  compared to and at december  and respectively 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase at a low double digit rate in research and development research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
the increased costs for compared to are primarily due to higher outsourced development costs 
research and development expenses increased by in due primarily to stock compensation expenses and patent acquisition legal fees 
we expect research and development expenses to almost double in due to the addition of the reading assistant employees and the amortization of the acquired intangible assets 
page general and administrative general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
the increase in expenses compared to is mostly due to the legal  accounting  printing and travel costs of approximately  related to our secondary stock offering 
stock compensation expense was also higher in than in these costs were partially offset by lower expenses for management incentive compensation 
general and administrative expenses increased by in due primarily to stock compensation expenses and incentive compensation expenses  partially offset by a reduction in accounting and legal fees relating to the restatement of financial results that were expensed in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement that were expensed in totaled approximately  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in other income from related party in september  we signed an agreement with posit science corporation psc  transferring our patented technology to psc for use in the health field 
during the twelve months ended december   and we recorded   and  respectively  for royalties received and services provided to psc 
amounts received to date and any future receipts are being reported as other income as we do not consider these royalties to be part of our recurring operations

for  interest and other income expense  net  consisted primarily of interest earned of  and a reclassification of  of service and support revenue relating to the same two customers 
in  interest and other income expense  net  comprised mainly interest earned on our invested cash of  and interest on officer loans of  all officer loans were repaid in full by march  income tax provision benefit during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this benefit included a million reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized  based on future projected taxable income for fiscal prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
these projections were based on one year of projected future taxable income 
as of december   we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through as of december   we had us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
california state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards reflected above are limited due to ownership changes as provided in the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
page liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
in january we expended million of our cash for the acquisition of the assets of soliloquy learning 
net cash provided by operations in was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million used in operations in overall  our receivable collection experience has remained strong throughout we collected million of receivables in  compared to million of receivables in and million in net cash used in investing activities in was million  consisting of net purchases of property and equipment of million  a loan to jtt holdings of million in connection with the january acquisition of soliloquy learning  and acquisition costs incurred of  during the year ended december   we purchased an enterprise wide customer relationship management system 
as of december  and  a net book value of million and  respectively  related to the purchase and subsequent implementation of this system was included in property and equipment 
these costs will be depreciated over the initial estimated useful life of five years 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the maturity of short term investments of million and officer loan repayments of million  partially offset by property and equipment purchases of million 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the purchase of million of short term investments and the purchase of hardware and software for million  which were more than offset by the repayment of million of officer loans 
net cash generated by financing activities in  and was million  million  and million respectively 
net cash generated by financing activities in all three years resulted from the sale of stock upon option exercises and through purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
there was no borrowing on our credit line in or because our booked sales tend to be seasonal  we may have negative cash flows in particular quarters  particularly the first quarter  when booked sales tend to be substantially lower than in other quarters 
on june  we amended our existing revolving line of credit agreement with comerica bank 
the maximum that can be borrowed under the agreement is million 
the line expires on december  borrowing under the line of credit bears interest at a floating prime rate  or a fixed rate of libor plus 
to secure the line we granted comerica a security interest in all of our assets other than our intellectual property 
we also agreed with comerica that we will not grant a security interest in our intellectual property to any third party 
borrowings under the line are subject to various covenants 
the agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit not to exceed million 
at december   we have an outstanding letter of credit for  there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at december  and we were in compliance with all our covenants 
we expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be our primary source of funds for the next several years 
again  this will require us to achieve certain levels of booked sales 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow from operations  we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing our expenses could adversely affect our operations by reducing the resources available for sales  marketing  research or development efforts 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
page contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities 
the minimum lease payment is approximately  per month through after the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also have a lease agreement for our tucson  arizona office through april at an average rent of approximately  per month for the period subsequent to january  in early  we entered into a new lease for our reading assistant operations in waltham  massachusetts for approximately  square feet that expires in september this lease  as well as the existing waltham lease that expires on march   is included in the table under operating lease obligations 
we also make royalty payments to the institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year 
the following table summarizes our obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
dollars in thousands and thereafter total contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our purchase order commitments at december  are not material effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling  of which approximately  is expected to be paid within one year 
for the remaining liability  due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
refer to note to the financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
loans to current and former officers in march we made full recourse loans to certain of our officers  in amounts totaling million 
in some of these officers left our company 
the notes were secured by shares of our common stock owned by the current and former officers 
the loans bore interest at 
principal and interest were due december  during the twelve months ended december  we received million in loan repayments  including interest 
at december  there was a remaining balance due of  this represented principal and interest from one of the former officers 
during the first quarter of we received the balance due in the form of cash and stock 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
page revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop 
sop provides specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of sop requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
multiple contracts with the same customer are generally accounted for as separate arrangements except in cases where contracts are so closely related that they are effectively part of a single arrangement 
product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments 
we adjust this allowance periodically based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs  which have been low in recent years 
cancellations and refunds are allowed in limited circumstances  and such amounts have not been significant 
page income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this benefit included a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized 
this determination was primarily based on projected taxable income 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal and state operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
we intend to maintain the remaining valuation allowance until sufficient further positive evidence exists to support further reversals of the valuation allowance 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
the estimated expected stock price volatility decreased from in to in our expected stock price volatility is based upon our historical experience over the expected life of the options  and this decrease occurred as a result of historical periods beyond the expected life of the options containing highly volatile prices being eliminated from the fiscal volatility calculation 
in the fourth quarter of we changed our estimate of the forfeiture rate from to  based on our experience of actual forfeiture rates 
this resulted in incremental stock compensation expense of approximately  in the fourth quarter 
stock compensation expense may be adjusted in the future if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our current estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents 
we did not hold any marketable debt securities at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our results of operations
