the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a rapidly growing designer  manufacturer  distributor  worldwide marketer and brand manager of footwear for men  women  and children 
we design and sell a broad offering of footwear  apparel  gear and accessories that utilize our proprietary closed cell resin  called croslite 
in the past several years  we realized high demand for our croslite products  specifically  classic beach and cayman models 
croslite is a unique material that enables us to produce an innovative  soft  lightweight  non marking  slip and odor resistant shoe 
crocs shoes combine fun colors and innovative designs to provide a new level of comfort  functionality and style in the casual lifestyle footwear category 
since the initial introduction and popularity of our beach and cayman models  we have expanded our croslite products to include a variety of new styles and products and have extended our product reach through the acquisitions of new brand platforms such as jibbitz  fury  ocean minded  bite  and through various licensing agreements 
we currently sell our crocs branded products throughout the us and in over countries worldwide 
we sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers and distributors and directly to end user consumers through our webstores  company operated retail stores and kiosks 
the broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels  including department stores and traditional footwear retailers as well as a variety of specialty channels 
as of december   our customer base domestically and internationally expanded to over  and  customer locations selling our products  respectively 
we have achieved significant growth since our inception  driven largely by the popularity of our footwear products and our ability to significantly expand the breadth and depth of our distribution network 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million and net income of million  compared to million of revenues and net income of million for the year ended december  we have achieved strong gross profit margins on sales of our crocs footwear 
for the year ended december   our gross profit was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  we believe a number of factors have contributed to our ability to achieve gross profit margins at these levels 
additionally  our use of third party manufacturers as well as company operated manufacturing facilities has allowed us to maintain a relatively low cost structure while enabling us to achieve significant production flexibility 
we currently manufacture our footwear products at our company operated facilities located in north america  brazil and italy in addition to contracting with third party manufacturers in china  bosnia  vietnam  romania and the us for production of our footwear products and accessories 
we believe our in house production capabilities enable us to make rapid changes to manufacturing schedules and provide us the flexibility to quickly ship in demand models and colors  while outsourcing allows us to lower our capital investment and retain the cost effectiveness of using third party manufacturing 
on november   our board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases under this authorization may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares of our common stock 
the repurchase authorization may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time 
on november   we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for a total of approximately million 
general revenues are recorded when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of related receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
allowances for estimated returns and discounts are recognized when related revenue is recorded 
because we use both internal manufacturing and contract with third parties to manufacture our products  our cost of sales represents our costs to manufacture products in our company operated facilities  including raw materials costs and all overhead expenses related to production  as well as the cost to purchase finished products from our third party manufacturers 
cost of sales also includes the cost to transport these products to our facilities and all warehouse and outbound freight expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling  marketing  wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs for selling  marketing and administrative employees  travel and insurance expenses  depreciation  amortization  professional fees  facility expenses  bank charges and non cash charges for share based compensation 
share based compensation expenses in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation sfas  which requires the calculation of the fair value of share based compensation  estimation of future forfeitures and income taxes  and recognition of the fair value as a non cash expense over the vesting period of the underlying instruments 
sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the footnote disclosure only provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for shares issued to employees apb  and instead requires that such transactions be recognized and reflected in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we adopted sfas r effective as of january  using the prospective method for option grants and restricted stock issued prior to august   which was the date we filed our initial registration statement on form s in connection with our initial public offering and the modified prospective method for option grants issued after august  the adoption of the sfas r fair value based method had a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash flow 
the effect of applying sfas r for the year ended december  was a decrease of million of pre tax income 
we recognized additional share based compensation expense in based on the fair value of any share based payments made in the amount of compensation expense recognized depends on numerous factors and estimates  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the publicly traded price of our common stock  estimated volatility of the stock price  estimates of the timing and volume of exercises and forfeitures of the options  and fluctuations in future interest and income tax rates 
share based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  effects of initial public offering in february  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
as a part of the initial public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock  adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on june   and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the initial public offering  all of our then outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock  which was not included in stockholders equity in our balance sheet  converted into  shares of our common stock  of which a portion was sold in our initial public offering  and accrued dividends aggregating  were paid with a portion of our net proceeds from the offering 
in addition  the put options on our redeemable shares of common stock terminated and such shares were also not previously included in stockholders equity in our balance sheet 
therefore  the immediate result of our initial public offering was a significant increase in cash and stockholders equity on our balance sheet  and the elimination of the accrual of dividends on the preferred stock 
in addition  our common stock outstanding increased significantly because of the conversion of the preferred stock  the termination of the put options on the redeemable shares of common stock and our issuance of shares of common stock 
as a result  the basis for the calculation of net income per share on both a basic and diluted basis has changed significantly 
acquisitions on january   we acquired substantially all of the assets of ocean minded for million in cash  plus a potential earn out of up to million based on ocean minded achieving certain earnings targets over a three year period 
ocean minded is a designer and manufacturer of high quality leather and eva ethylene vinyl acetate based sandals primarily for the beach  adventure and action sports markets 
we recorded  in customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets and  in goodwill on the date we acquired ocean minded 
on june   we amended the purchase agreement with jibbitz to amend the terms of the potential earn out consideration included in the purchase agreement 
the amendment removed the earnings targets for payment of the earn out with million payable on the effective date of the amended purchase agreement and the remaining million payable in equal monthly installments of  due on the first business day of each month until july we recorded the additional million  net of discounting on future payments  to goodwill in the second quarter of as an additional cost of the acquisition 
as of december   we have million  net of discounting on future payments  in remaining accrued additional purchase price for jibbitz 
on july   we acquired all of the assets of bite for million in cash and the assumption of million in debt  plus a potential earn out of up to million based on bite achieving certain earnings targets over a three year period 
bite is a designer and manufacturer of comfortable and supportive performance shoes and sports sandals sold worldwide in five categories including  golf  adventure  healthy lifestyle  travel and watersports 
we recorded  in customer relationships and  in goodwill on the date of acquisition for bite

we have historically experienced margins that exceed those of our competitors 
as we expand our product lines and introduce new products and materials to our manufacturing processes  we may incur higher costs on duties  material and labor and face increasing competition which could result in a decrease to our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased or million  to million  or of sales  in the year ended december   from million  or of sales in the year ended december  the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales is a result of our strategic decision to increase our global marketing spend and increased expenses associated with developing market opportunities in brazil  china  russia and india

we also intend to continue to expand our product line into other categories including apparel  gear  sports equipment and accessories 
we expect that new product introductions  limitations on production capacities and seasonal variations may cause our inventory to increase or decrease materially in the future as we adjust to meeting changing conditions resulting from our rapid growth and ongoing expansion 
we anticipate that operating activities will provide cash in future periods 
however  seasonal variations in product demand and the associated changes in operating assets and liabilities in response to such seasonal variations may directly affect our cash flows from operating activities 
accordingly  cash flows from operating activities for any year are not necessarily indicative of cash flows from operating activities to be expected for any other year

expansion of our product line will require us to make ongoing capital investments in molds and other tooling equipment related to manufacturing new products 
the rapid growth of our sales in both domestic and international markets has  in the past  placed substantial demands on our warehousing and distribution operations and we expect that these demands will continue 
in december  we entered into an agreement with manhattan associates to provide warehouse management systems within all of our company operated distribution centers 
we plan to continue to invest in information technology systems that will support our growth and increase the operating effectiveness of our manufacturing  warehousing  and distribution operations

cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  on november   our board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases under this authorization may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the repurchase authorization may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time 
on november   we repurchased approximately  shares for a total of approximately million 
as of december   we had a million revolving loan agreement which expires on may  as of december  we had million outstanding under the facility 
at our option  the loan agreement unpaid principal balance of the loan bears interest at either a base interest rate of libor plus or a variable interest rate of the lender s applicable reference rate minus 
the line of credit contains financial and other covenants as well as customary events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants required by the loan agreement 
on january  we entered into a second amendment on our revolving loan agreement that provides for an increase in our borrowing facility from million to million 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet or exceed the ongoing needs of our existing business during the next months 
however  we may enter into additional borrowing arrangements  or modify existing borrowing arrangements  should additional liquidity be required to fund working capital requirements  to make additional investments in capital assets and our global infrastructure  or to fund business acquisitions 
there is a degree of uncertainty in forecasting our future cash requirements as a result of our rapid growth since inception 
substantial increases in accounts receivable and inventory are commonly associated with rapid growth and could unexpectedly strain our cash resources in the future 
there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease obligations  which include various building and equipment transactions  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see contractual obligations below for further detail 
we also guarantee the payment of its third party manufacturer in china for purchases of material for the manufacture of finished shoe products  which is also not reflected on our balance sheet 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the guarantee is million  approximately million 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  intangible assets  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventories  share based compensation and goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived principally from wholesale sales to retailers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into an agreement with a customer or persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the arrangement with the customer 
reserves and write downs allowances for estimated returns and claims are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual returns and claims exceed reserves  we would need to reduce our revenues at the time of such determination 
we also make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of some of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination and record it to cost of sales 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas r which requires recognition of the fair value of share based compensation over the vesting period of the option 
we adopted the prospective method for all stock option grants issued prior to august   which was the date we initially filed a registration statement on form s with the sec in connection with our initial public offering 
prior to august   we used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
we continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards which were the provisions of apb and its related interpretive guidance 
for stock option grants issued after the filing of our initial registration statement on form s on august   we applied the modified prospective method 
under this method we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options  which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility  the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates 
the volatility assumptions were derived from our historical volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation in future periods  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
significant judgment is required in determining whether the recognition threshold has been met for recording an uncertain tax benefit and in determining the appropriate measurement of the uncertain benefit under fin fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition and was effective beginning january  there was no cumulative effect of the adoption of fin tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  accordingly  no us income taxes are provided on these earnings 
we have specific plans for reinvestment of these undistributed earnings in our foreign operations 
should we change our plans and remit these earnings as dividends to the us affiliates  we would be required to record the related us income tax attributes which would impact our earnings in the year of such repatriation and would impact the related deferred us income tax assets and liabilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by sfas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives  such as customer relationships  core technology  capitalized software  patents and non compete agreements are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
acquisitions 
we account for business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
these estimates and assumptions affect future amortization expense and gains or losses recorded on any future sale of operating or other assets and acquisitions of properties 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit and interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that united states interest rates change due to inflation or other factors 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
the interest payable on our line of credit is determined based on either a base interest rate of libor plus or a variable interest rate of the lender s applicable reference rate minus  and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on our capital leases are dependent on interest rates in effect at the time the lease is drawn upon 
total liabilities outstanding at december  under the line of credit and capital leases were approximately million 
based on amounts borrowed as of december   we would have a resulting decline in future annual earnings and cash flows of approximately  for every increase in prime lending rates 
we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates  and if the weighted average rate of return on cash and cash equivalents  and restricted cash  were to increase or decrease by  the impact on interest income would be  net of tax during the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk we pay the majority of our overseas third party manufacturers in us dollars and have had significant revenues from foreign sales in recent periods 
our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for our products or losses from currency exchange rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates 
if the us dollar were to increase or decrease in value by  the impact on international sales of million during the year ended december  would have been an increase or decrease in consolidated revenues by million  net of tax 
the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and purchases increase and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies we receive for such sales
