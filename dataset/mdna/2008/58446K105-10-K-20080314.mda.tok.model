item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors in item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview mediacom communications corporation is the nation s eighth largest cable television company based on the number of basic video subscribers  and among the leading cable operators focused on serving the smaller cities and towns in the united states 
through our interactive broadband network  we provide our customers with a wide array of advanced products and services  including video services such as vod  hdtv and dvrs  hsd and phone service 
we offer triple play bundles of video  hsd and voice to almost of our estimated homes passed 
bundled products and services offer our customers a single provider contact for ordering  provisioning  billing and customer care 
as of december   our cable systems passed an estimated million homes and served million basic subscribers in states 
we provide digital video services to  customers  representing a digital penetration of of our basic subscribers  hsd service to  customers  representing a data penetration of of our estimated homes passed  and phone service to  customers  representing a penetration of of our estimated marketable phone homes 
we evaluate our performance  in part  by measuring the number of rgus we serve 
as of december   we served million rgus  representing an increase of over the prior year 
we have faced increasing levels of competition for our video programming services over the past several years  primarily from dbs providers 
since they have been permitted to deliver local television broadcast signals beginning in  directv and dish now have essentially ubiquitous coverage in our markets with local television broadcast signals 
their ability to deliver local television broadcast signals has been a significant cause of our loss of basic subscribers in recent years 
hurricane losses in in july and august  as a result of hurricanes dennis and katrina  our cable systems in areas of alabama  florida  and mississippi experienced  to varying degrees  damage to their cable plant and other property and equipment  service interruption and loss of customers 
we estimate that the hurricanes initially caused losses of approximately  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers 
as of december   we have not recovered a significant number of these subscribers 
adjusted oibda we define adjusted oibda as operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results  but is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs 
we believe adjusted oibda is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management  and provides a measure that can be used to analyze  value and compare the companies in the cable television industry  which may have different depreciation and amortization policies  as well as different non cash  share based compensation programs 
adjusted oibda and similar measures are used in calculating compliance with the covenants of our debt arrangements 
a limitation of adjusted oibda  however  is that it excludes depreciation and amortization  which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business 
management utilizes a separate process to budget  measure and evaluate capital expenditures 
in addition  
table of contents adjusted oibda has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the our non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda should not be regarded as an alternative to either operating income or net income loss as an indicator of operating performance nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that operating income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted oibda

note certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year s amounts to conform to the current year s presentation 
revenues rose year over year  largely attributable to the growth in our data and phone customers 
rgus grew year over year  and average total monthly revenue per rgu was higher than the prior year 
video revenues represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television products and services including basic and digital cable programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation  reconnection and late payment fees and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers  including commercial establishments  for our data products and services and equipment rental fees 
phone revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers 
advertising revenues represent the sale of advertising time on various channels 
video revenues increased  due to higher service fees from our advanced video products and services such as dvrs and hdtv  offset by a lower number of basic subscribers 
during the year ended december   we lost  basic subscribers  including a significant number of basic subscribers lost in connection with the retransmission consent dispute with an owner of a major television broadcast group  and the sale of the period of cable systems serving on a net basis  basic subscribers  as compared to a loss of  basic subscribers in the prior year 
digital customers grew by  as compared to an increase of  in the prior year 
we ended the year with  digital customers  representing a penetration of basic subscribers 
as of december   of digital customers received dvr and or hdtv services  as compared to in the prior year 
data revenues rose  primarily due to a year over year increase in data customers 
data customers grew by  as compared to a gain of  in the prior year  ending the year with  customers  or a penetration of estimated homes passed 
phone revenues grew  primarily due to a year over year increase in phone customers 
phone customers grew by  as compared to a gain of  in the prior year  ending the year with 
table of contents customers  or a penetration of estimated marketable phone homes 
as of december   mediacom phone was marketed to nearly of our million estimated homes passed 
advertising revenues increased by  as a result of stronger national advertising sales  despite a meaningful decline in political advertising from the prior year 
costs and expenses significant service costs include programming expenses  employee expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network  perform customer installation activities and provide customer support  data costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity and customer provisioning  and field operating costs  including outside contractors  vehicle  utilities and pole rental expenses 
video programming costs  which are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  represent our largest single expense and have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our customers 
these costs are expected to continue to grow principally because of contractual unit rate increases and the increasing demands of television broadcast station owners for retransmission consent fees 
as a consequence  it is expected that our video gross margins will decline as increases in programming costs outpace growth in video revenues 
service costs rose  primarily due to customer growth in our phone and hsd services and increases in programming and field operating expenses 
recurring expenses related to our phone and hsd services grew  commensurate with the significant increase of our phone and data customers 
programming expense rose  principally as a result of higher unit costs charged by our programming vendors  offset in part by a lower number of basic subscribers 
field operating costs rose  primarily as a result of higher outside contractor usage  increases in utility  fuel and vehicle maintenance costs  costs associated with our mobile workforce management system and the purchase of antennas for distribution to our customers during the aforementioned retransmission consent dispute 
service costs as a percentage of revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
significant selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call centers  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  marketing  bad debt  billing  advertising  and office costs related to telecommunications and office administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses rose  principally due to higher marketing  bad debt and billing expenses  offset in part by reductions in telecommunication and employee benefit costs 
marketing costs rose by  largely due to increases in direct mailing campaigns  higher salaries  sales commissions and recruiting costs and a greater use of outside contracted sales personnel 
bad debt expenses grew by  primarily due to higher average write offs per delinquent account  unusually low write offs of uncollectable accounts in the prior year and increased collection expense 
billing expenses rose by  largely due to increased processing  bank and credit card fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses rose  principally due to increases in non cash  share based compensation  and legal fees 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were for each of the years ended december  and depreciation and amortization increased  primarily due to increased deployment of customer premise equipment and related installation activities 
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda rose  due to revenue growth  especially in data and phone  offset in part by increases in service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents operating income operating income decreased year over year  largely due to higher depreciation and amortization and service costs  substantially offset by the growth in adjusted obida 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to higher average indebtedness  the expiration of certain interest rate hedging agreements with favorable rates and higher market interest rates on variable rate debt 
loss on derivatives  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the changes in their mark to market values are derived primarily from changes in market interest rates  the decrease in their time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
these swaps have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded losses on derivatives amounting to million and million  based upon information provided by our counterparties  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we incurred a loss of million for the year ended december   as a result of our redemption of our senior notes due provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances  we determined that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result  we increased our valuation allowance and recognized a million corresponding non cash charge to income tax expense for the year ended december  we periodically assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
as a result of these assessments in prior periods and the current period  we have established valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
net loss as a result of the factors described above  primarily interest expense  depreciation and amortization and loss on derivatives  net  partially offset by adjusted oibda  we incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december

video revenues increased  as a result of the impact of basic rate increases applied on our subscribers and higher service fees from our advanced video products and services  offset in part by the loss of basic subscribers 
during the year ended december   we lost  basic subscribers as compared to a loss of  basic subscribers in the prior year

phone revenues were million for the year ended december  phone customers grew by  during  as compared to  in as of december   mediacom phone was marketed to million homes 
advertising revenues increased  largely as a result of stronger local advertising sales and political advertising 
political advertising  which was negligible in  contributed approximately of overall advertising revenue growth in costs and expenses service costs rose  primarily due to increases in programming and employee expenses and customer growth in our phone and hsd services 
video programming expense increased  principally as a result of higher unit costs charged by our programming vendors  offset in part by a lower number of basic subscribers

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have invested  and will continue to invest  in our network to enhance our reliability and capacity and the further deployment of advanced broadband services 
our capital spending has recently shifted from mainly network upgrade investments to the deployment of advanced services  and we also may continue to make strategic acquisitions of cable systems 
we have a high level of indebtedness and incur significant amounts of interest expense each year 
we believe that we will meet interest expense and principal payments also referred to as debt service  capital spending and other requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and our ability to secure future external financing 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient future financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
as of december   our total debt was billion 
of this amount  million matures during the year ending december  during the year ended december   we paid cash interest of million  net of capitalized interest 
as of december   about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
bank credit facilities we own our cable systems through two principal subsidiaries  mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc llc group have a billion bank credit facility the llc credit facility expiring in  of which million was outstanding as of december  the llc credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan and a million term loan 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc broadband group have a billion bank credit facility the broadband credit facility expiring in  of which billion was outstanding as of december  the broadband credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan  and a million term loan 
continued access to our credit facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with the covenants of these credit facilities  including covenants tied to our operating performance  principally the requirement that we maintain a maximum ratio of total senior debt to cash flow  as defined in our credit agreements  of to as of december   we had  in total  unused revolving credit commitments of approximately million  all of which could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes based on the terms and conditions of our debt arrangements 
as of the same date  the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under our credit facilities was the llc credit facility is collateralized by llc group s pledge of all its ownership interests in the operating subsidiaries owned by llc group and is guaranteed by llc group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
the broadband credit facility is collateralized by broadband group s pledge of all its ownership interests in the operating subsidiaries owned by broadband group and is guaranteed by broadband group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued under our bank credit facilities to various parties as collateral for our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements 
interest rate exchange agreements as of december   we have entered into interest rate swaps with counterparties to hedge billion of floating rate debt at weighted average fixed rate of 
these swaps are scheduled to expire in the amounts of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and have been accounted for on a mark to market basis as of  and for the year ended december  under the terms of all of our interest rate swaps  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are major banking firms with investment grade ratings  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 

table of contents senior notes we have issued senior notes through mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc totaling billion as of december  the indentures governing our senior notes also contain financial and other covenants  though they are generally less restrictive than those found in our bank credit facilities and do not require us to maintain any financial ratios 
principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow  as defined in these debt agreements  of to in the case of mediacom llc s senior notes  and to in the case of mediacom broadband llc s senior notes 
these agreements also contain limitations on dividends  investments and distributions 
covenant compliance and debt ratings for all periods through december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our bank credit facilities and other debt arrangements 
we believe that we will not have any difficulty complying with any of the applicable covenants in the foreseeable future 
our future access to the debt markets and the terms and conditions we receive are influenced by our debt ratings 
our corporate credit ratings are b  with a stable outlook  by moodys  and b  with a stable outlook  by standard and poors 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in our credit facilities or our other debt arrangements that are based on changes in our credit ratings assigned by any rating agency 
any future downgrade to our credit ratings could increase the interest rate on future debt issuance and adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the change of million is primarily due to an million increase in adjusted oibda and million cash payment made in relating to early extinguishment of debt  partially offset by a million reduction in the changes in operating assets and liabilities and an million increase in interest expense 
during the year ended december   the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was million  due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts receivable  net  of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and a decrease in non current liabilities of million  offset in part by an increase in deferred revenue of million 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities  which consisted primarily of capital expenditures  were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures increased million from  primarily due to greater customer installations and equipment and network enhancements 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of cable systems and purchased a cable system for million 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the prior year 
pursuant to our board authorized share repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended december  we paid for such share repurchases using borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our subsidiary credit facilities 
for the year ended december  new borrowings exceeded repayment of debt by million 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow  for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter dollars in thousands capital operating interest purchase debt leases leases expense obligations total thereafter total cash obligations refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt  and to note for a discussion of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies 
interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of december  and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations 
we have contracts with programmers who provide video programming services to our subscribers 
programming is our largest expense  however  our contracts typically provide that we have an obligation to purchase video programming for our subscribers as long as we deliver cable services to such subscribers 
we have no obligation to purchase these services if we are not providing cable services  except when we do not have the right to cancel the underlying contract or for contracts with a guaranteed minimum commitment 
we have included such amounts in our purchase obligations above  as follows million for and million for critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with sfas no 
financial reporting by cable television companies 
costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer s dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets 
we use standard costing models  developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data  to determine our capitalized amounts 
these models include labor rates  overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities 
the development of these standards involves significant judgment by management  especially in the development of standards for our newer  advanced products and services in which historical data is limited 
changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any changes to these estimates  which may be significant  are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed 

table of contents indefinite lived intangibles our cable systems operate under non exclusive franchises granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and they were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new subscribers and to market new  advanced products and services 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these cable franchise rights contribute to our revenues 
accordingly  with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize the cable franchise rights and goodwill 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
based on the guidance outlined in eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the unit of accounting for testing franchise value for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the unit reporting level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have two borrowing groups  or reporting units  for the purpose of applying sfas no 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
to test our goodwill and cable franchise rights for impairment 
we assess the fair values of each cable system cluster using discounted cash flow methodology  under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner 
this involves significant judgment  as well as certain assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow expectations and other future benefits  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if these estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
such impairments could potentially be material 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  calculated using the residual method  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights and goodwill 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards  we assess all available positive and negative evidence including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
in forecasting future taxable income we use assumptions that require significant judgment and are consistent with the estimates we use to manage our business 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to the provision for income taxes 
at december   the valuation allowance had a balance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for 
table of contents the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
we expect to add to our valuation allowance any increase in deferred tax liabilities relating to indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will also adjust our valuation allowance if we assess that there is sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periods the estimates are revised 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and expands on required disclosures about fair value measurement 
sfas no 
will be effective as of january  and will be applied prospectively 
we do not expect that this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we do not expect that this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which continues to require the treatment that all business combinations be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
under the acquisition method  the acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any contingent consideration and contractual contingencies  as a whole  at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
under sfas no 
r  all transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
the guidance in sfas no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
requires that a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as a minority interest be separately reported in the equity section of the consolidated entity s balance sheet 
sfas no 
also established accounting and reporting standards for i ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  ii the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  iii changes in a parent s ownership interest  iv the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and v sufficient disclosures to identify the interest of the parent and the noncontrolling owners 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the fcc s existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in programming 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 

table of contents item a
