item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  the company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in the company s sales returns  net earnings for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
the company s primary sales program the preferred retailer program offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period  as well as potential rebates and discounts  for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
under this program  qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased 
discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale 
for rebates  the company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases 
the estimate is based on the historical level of purchases  adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels 
the estimated year end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels  as necessary 
the preferred retailer program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year end 
in addition to the preferred retailer program  the company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature 
historically the company s actual costs related to its preferred retailer program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates 

table of contents revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with applicable state escheatment laws  if any 
the company s gift cards have no expiration  therefore  to determine when redemption is remote  the company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used and compares that information with historical redemption trends 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues 
however  if the company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards increased million to million during the year ended december  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
the calculation of the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and pricing  regulatory usga and r a rule changes  the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
historically  there have been no material inventory write offs for which an allowance had not previously been established 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory  net earnings for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  the timing of the impairment test  and the asset s residual value  if any 
the company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when applying these impairment rules 
to determine fair value  the company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate  quoted market prices and royalty rates when available and independent appraisals  as appropriate 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 

table of contents warranty policy the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
the company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period  where little or no claims experience may exist 
experience has shown that warranty rates can vary between product models  therefore the company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long term historical warranty rates until sufficient data is available 
as actual model specific rates become available  the company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
historically  the company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation 
however  if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s warranty obligation  net earnings for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
income taxes current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
effective january   the company was required to adopt and implement the provisions of fin  which requires the company to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to pay such additional taxes 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than likelihood of being sustained 
as a result of the adoption of fin  the company recognized an increase in the liability for its uncertain tax positions of  of which the entire charge was accounted for as a decrease to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the accrual for uncertain tax positions can result in a difference between the estimated benefit recorded in the company s financial statements and the benefit taken or expected to be taken in the company s income tax returns 
this difference is generally referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit 
the company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the united states and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of 
table of contents tax paid by the company 
the company  in consultation with its tax advisors  bases its income tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the income tax returns  however  are subject to routine audits by the various federal  state and international taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company files its income tax returns 
as part of these reviews  a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the tax positions taken by the company 
the resolution of any disagreements over the company s tax positions often involves complex issues and may span multiple years  particularly if litigation is involved 
the ultimate resolution of these tax positions is often uncertain until the audit is complete and any disagreements are resolved 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company therefore accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statute of limitations  or upon occurrence of other events 
historically  additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the company s expectations 
information regarding income taxes is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation beginning in fiscal year  the company accounts for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the company s expected stock price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to its results of operations 
in accordance with sfas r  the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of awards expected to vest 
the number of awards expected to vest is based on the number of awards granted adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
the total compensation cost is then recognized ratably over the vesting period 
if actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
during the company granted performance units to certain employees under the company s equity incentive plan 
performance units are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the company s performance against specified performance targets over a three year period 
the estimated fair value of the performance units is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the grant date multiplied by the expected number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the performance period 
the company uses forecasted performance metrics to estimate the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the forecasted metrics  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to its results of operations

the company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year 
the company s products are designed for golfers of all skill levels  both amateur and professional 
the company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products  which are segregated between golf clubs and golf balls 
the golf clubs segment consists primarily of callaway golf  top flite and ben hogan woods  hybrids  irons  wedges and putters as well as odyssey putters 
this segment also includes other golf related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre owned golf clubs 
the golf balls segment consists primarily of callaway golf and top flite golf balls 
as discussed below and in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate and general administrative expenses and other income expense not utilized by management in determining segment profitability 
while the company s golf clubs segment has been profitable  the company s golf balls segment has historically reported annual operating losses for all periods until the current year 
the operating results of the company s golf balls segment includes charges for the applicable periods related to the integration of the callaway golf and top flite golf ball operations acquired in september the top flite integration initiatives  charges for the company wide restructuring initiatives announced in september the restructuring initiatives and charges related to the cost reduction initiatives that target gross margin improvements announced during the fourth quarter of the gross margin improvement initiatives 
the company s golf balls segment results of operations have improved significantly from a loss of million in including charges of million for the top flite integration initiatives to profitability of million in including charges of million and million for the restructuring initiatives and the gross margin improvement initiatives  respectively 
as previously announced  the company has taken action to address the profitability of its golf ball business  including a re launch of the top flite brand in  which included among other things the launch of the new d golf ball  an updated brand logo as well as an aggressive marketing campaign 
beginning in november and continuing throughout  the company implemented certain gross margin improvement initiatives 
these gross margin improvement initiatives primarily consisted of process improvements in i the procurement of direct materials  including all components used in finished products  ii the procurement of indirect goods and services not utilized in finished product such as travel and non manufacturing temporary labor among others  iii the company s manufacturing and distribution process primarily through the elimination of redundant activities as well as streamlining the process in which the company s distributes components and finished goods worldwide  and iv value engineering and automation  which incorporates strategic capital investments to automate processes and create efficiencies within the company s operational areas 
as a result of these initiatives  as well as certain other factors  the company s gross margins improved to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the company expects to continue implementing these and other gross margin improvement initiatives in in most of the company s key markets  the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis 
weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year round  except in a few small markets  with many of the company s on course customers closing for the cold weather months 
the company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in general  during the first quarter  the company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season 
this initial sell in generally continues into the second quarter 
the company s second quarter sales are also significantly affected by the amount of re order business of the products 
table of contents sold during the first quarter 
the company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on re order business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season 
the company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the company s key markets 
this seasonality  and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations  can be affected by many factors  including the timing of new product introductions 
in general  however  because of this seasonality  a majority of the company s sales and most  if not all  of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year 
years ended december  and net sales increased million to  million for the year ended december  as compared to  million for the year ended december  the overall increase in net sales is primarily due to the company s strong product line and improvements to the company s supply chain during the current year  which improvements allowed the company to make the necessary adjustments to supply the products for the increased demand
