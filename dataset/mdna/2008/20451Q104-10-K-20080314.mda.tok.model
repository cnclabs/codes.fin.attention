overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  dated as of april  the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because of our belief that these companies are often more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 
based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of over  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as in typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate

american furniture fire on february    american furniture s million square foot corporate office and manufacturing facility in ecru  ms was partially destroyed in a fire 
approximately thousand square feet of the facility was impacted by the fire 
the executive offices were fundamentally unaffected 
the recliner and motion plant  although largely unaffected  suffered some smoke damage but resumed operations on february  there were no injuries related to the fire 
temporarily  the company has moved its stationary production lines into other facilities 
in addition to its thousand square foot flex facility  management has secured thousand square feet of additional manufacturing and warehouse space in the surrounding pontotoc area 
the production lines at the flex facility were operating on february  and the other temporary production lines were operating on february  these temporary stationary production lines are fully operational and provide the company with approximately of the pre fire stationary production capabilities 
orders for stationary products are being addressed by these temporary facilities  whereas the orders for motion and recliner products are being addressed by the production facilities that were largely unaffected by the fire at the ecru facility 
management continues to seek additional temporary manufacturing and warehouse space  and believes that it will be able to secure additional facilities and bring production back to the pre fire levels within days 
we are committed to exhaust all resources available to fast track setting up temporary operations in order to minimize the impact on our employees and curtail delivery delays for our customers 
american furniture is currently evaluating its business interruption and property insurance coverage as it pertains to this fire

the insurance will cover losses as the result of property damage and from lost operating profits 
areas for focus in the areas of focus for  which are generally applicable to each of our businesses  include achieving productivity savings and price increases to offset inflation  achieving sales growth  technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion  especially focused on emerging regions in china  continuing to grow through disciplined acquisition and rigorous integration processes  proactively managing raw material cost increases  and driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management enabling continued investment in our businesses  strategic acquisitions  and enabling us to return value to our shareholders  results of operations we were formed on november  and acquired our existing businesses segments as follows may  august  february  august  advanced circuits anodyne aeroglide american furniture cbs personnel halo silvue fiscal represents the only full year of operations included in our consolidated results of operations for four of our businesses

we may generate interest income on the investment of available funds  but expect such earnings to be minimal 
our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the company to such businesses  as well as equity interests in those companies 
cash flows coming to the trust and the company is the result of interest payments on those loans  amortization of those loans and  in the future  potentially  dividends on our equity ownership

the company accrued approximately million and million in non cash expense during the years ended december  and  respectively in connection with this agreement 
this expense represents that portion of the estimated increase in the value of our original businesses over our basis in those businesses that our manager is entitled to if the management services agreement were terminated or those businesses were sold see related party transactions 
results of operations our businesses as previously discussed  we acquired our businesses on various acquisition dates beginning may  see table above 
as a result  our consolidated operating results only include the results of operations since the acquisition date associated with the business 
the following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations for each of our businesses for the entire twelve month period ending december  and  irrespective of the acquisition date  which we believe is a more meaningful comparison in explaining the historical financial performance of the business 
these results of operations do not reflect direct one time seller costs incurred by the subsidiary resulting from our purchase of the and acquisitions 
the following results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year going forward

the ac credit agreement was amended to i provide for additional term loan borrowings of  and to permit the proceeds thereof to fund cash distributions totaling million by aci to compass ac holdings  inc ach  aci s sole shareholder  and by ach to its shareholders  including the company  ii extend the maturity dates of the loans under the ac credit agreement  and iii modify certain financial covenants of aci under the ac credit agreement 
the company s share of the cash distribution was approximately million with approximately million being distributed to ach s other shareholders 
all other material terms and conditions of the credit agreement were unchanged 
each loan has a scheduled maturity and each business is entitled to repay all or a portion of the principal amount of the outstanding loans  without penalty  prior to maturity 
our primary source of cash is from the receipt of interest and principal on our outstanding loans to our businesses 
accordingly  we are dependent upon the earnings of and cash flow of these businesses  which are available for i operating expenses  ii payment of principal and interest under our credit agreement  iii payments to cgm due or potentially due pursuant to the management services agreement  the llc agreement  and the supplemental put agreement  iv cash distributions to our shareholders and v investments in future acquisitions 
payments made under iii above are required to be paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds held by us  which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures 
a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million was recorded during the year ended december  in order to recognize our estimated  potential liability in connection with the supplemental put agreement between us and cgm 
approximately million of the accrued profit allocation was paid in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the sale of crosman 
a liability of approximately million is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet  which represents our estimated liability for this obligation at december  we believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity and resources to meet our existing obligations including anticipated distributions to our shareholders over the next twelve months 
on december  we amended our existing million credit facility with a group of lenders led by madison capital  llc 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility totaling million which matures in november and a term loan facility totaling million 
the term loan facility requires quarterly payments of  commencing march  with a final payment of the outstanding principal balance due on december  the revolving credit facility matures on december  the credit agreement permits the company to increase  over the next two years  the amount available under the revolving credit facility by up to million and the term loan facility by up to million  subject to certain restrictions and lender approval 
the revolving credit facility allows for loans at either base rate or libor 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greater of i the prime rate of interest published by the wall street journal and ii the sum of the federal funds rate plus for the relevant period  plus a margin ranging from to based upon the ratio of total debt to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest expense  tax expense  and depreciation and amortization expenses for such period the total debt to ebitda ratio

we intend to use the availability under our credit agreement to pursue acquisitions of additional businesses to the extent permitted under our credit agreement and to provide for working capital needs 
on january  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement with a bank  fixing the rate of million at on a like amount of variable rate term loan facility borrowings 
the interest rate swap is intended to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and effectively converts million of our floating rate term facility debt to a fixed rate basis for a period of three years 
the table below details cash receipts and payments that are not reflected on our income statement in order to provide an additional measure of management s estimate of cash flow available for distribution cad 
cad is a non gaap measure that we believe provides additional information to evaluate our ability to make anticipated quarterly distributions 
it is not necessarily comparable with similar measures provided by other entities 
we believe that cad  together with future distributions and cash available from our businesses net of reserves will be sufficient to meet our anticipated distributions over the next twelve months 
the table below reconciles cad to net income and to cash flow provided by operating activities  which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

cash flows from american furniture are typically highest in the months of march through june of each year  coinciding with homeowners tax refunds 
cash flows from cbs personnel are typically lower in the march quarter of each year than in other quarters due to reduced seasonal demand for temporary staffing services and to lower gross margins during that period associated with the front end loading of certain taxes and other payments associated with payroll paid to our employees 
cash flows from halo are typically highest in the months of september through december of each year primarily as the result of calendar sales and holiday promotions 
halo generates approximately two thirds of its operating income in the months of september through december related party transactions we have entered into the following agreements with cgm 
any fees associated with the agreements described below must be paid  if applicable  prior to the payment of any distributions to shareholders 
management services agreement llc agreement supplemental put agreement management services agreement we entered into a management services agreement with cgm effective may  the management services agreement provides for cgm to perform services for us in exchange for a management fee paid quarterly and equal to of our adjusted net assets 
we amended the management services agreement on november  and march   to clarify that adjusted net assets are not reduced by non cash charges associated with the supplemental put  and that the manager is entitled to reimbursement of non compensatory expenses incurred by the manager and its personnel to the extent specifically permitted under the provisions of the management services agreement dealing with the reimbursement of manager expenses  which amendments were unanimously approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors 
the management fee is required to be paid prior to the payment of any distributions to shareholders 
for the year ended december  we incurred approximately million to cgm for its quarterly management fees 
llc agreement as distinguished from its position of providing management services to us  pursuant to the management services agreement  cgm is also an equity holder of our allocation interests 
as such  cgm has the right to a distribution pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of certain events 
cgm paid  for the aforementioned allocation interests and has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests it owns under certain circumstances  see supplemental put agreement below 
supplemental put agreement as distinct from its role as our manager  cgm is also the owner of of the allocation interests in the company 
concurrent with the ipo  cgm and the company entered into a supplemental put agreement  which may require the company to acquire these allocation interests upon termination of the management services agreement 
essentially  the put rights granted to cgm require us to acquire cgm s allocation interests in the company at a price based on a percentage of the increase in fair value in the company s businesses over its basis in those businesses 
each fiscal quarter we estimate the fair value of our businesses for the purpose of determining our potential liability associated with the supplemental put agreement 
any change in the potential liability is accrued currently as a non cash adjustment to earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in non cash expense related to the supplemental put agreement 
as a result of the sale of crosman we paid cgm approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  which represented the profit allocation due 
anodyne acquisition on july   we acquired from cgi and its wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  compass medical mattress partners  lp cmmp approximately of the outstanding capital stock  on a fully diluted basis  of anodyne  representing approximately of the voting power of all anodyne stock 
pursuant to the same agreement  we also acquired from cmmp all of the original loans 
on the same date  we entered into a note purchase and sale agreement with cgi and cmmp for the purchase from cmmp of a promissory note issued by a borrower controlled by anodyne s chief executive officer totaling million 
the promissory note accrues interest at the rate of per annum and is added to the notes principal balance 
the note matures in august  the balance of the promissory note and accrued interest totals approximately million at december  acquisitions cgm acted as an advisor to us in these transactions for which it received transaction services fees and expense payments totaling approximately million 
advanced circuits transactions on october   we entered into an amendment to the ac credit agreement 
the ac credit agreement was amended to i provide for additional term loan borrowings of  and to permit the proceeds thereof to fund cash distributions totaling million by ach  aci s sole shareholder  and by ach to its shareholders  including the company  ii extend the maturity dates of the loans under the ac credit agreement  and iii modify certain financial covenants of aci under the ac credit agreement 
the company s share of the cash distribution was approximately million with approximately million being distributed to ach s other shareholders 
all other material terms and conditions of the credit agreement were unchanged 
the aci minority interest share of the distribution exceeded aci s cumulative minority interest earnings by approximately million excess distribution as of december  as a result  in accordance with eitf  implementation issues related to the minority interests in certain real estate investment trusts  the excess distribution is charged to minority interest in the company s consolidated income statement  and is effectively absorbed by the majority interest 
this excess distribution will be credited in the future against aci minority interest income  if any  of advanced circuits until such time that the excess distribution charge to the company s equity is reduced to zero

afm purchases polyfoam from independent on an arms length basis and afm performs regular audits to verify market pricing 
afm does not have any long term supply contracts with independent 
total purchases from independent during the months ended december  totaled approximately million and from september  our acquisition date purchases from independent were approximately million contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have no special purpose entities or off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business 
long term contractual obligations  except for our long term debt obligations  are generally not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet

this agreement has not been terminated and there is no basis upon which to determine a date in the future  if any  that this amount will be paid 
the table does not include the long term portion of the actuarially developed reserve for workers compensation  which does not provide for annual estimated payments beyond one year 
this liability  totaling approximately million at december   is included in our balance sheet as a component of other non current liabilities 
critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for the company  the trust and each of our businesses 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our manager s agreement  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
we record the supplemental put agreement at its fair value quarterly by recording any change in value through the income statement 
the fair value of the supplemental put agreement is largely related to the value of the profit allocation that our manager  as holder of allocation interests  will receive 
the valuation of the supplemental put agreement requires the use of complex models  which require highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
cbs personnel recognizes revenue for temporary staffing services at the time services are provided by cbs personnel employees and reports revenue based on gross billings to customers 
revenue from cbs personnel employee leasing services is recorded at the time services are provided 
such revenue is reported on a net basis gross billings to clients less worksite employee salaries  wages and payroll related taxes 
we believe that net revenue accounting for leasing services more closely depicts the transactions with its leasing customers and is consistent with guidelines outlined in emerging issue task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the effect of using this method of accounting is to report lower revenue than would be otherwise reported 
aeroglide  a majority owned subsidiary  enters into long term contracts with customers to design and build specialized machinery  based on a customer s specific needs  for drying and cooling a wide range of natural and man made products 
revenue under these long term sales contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method prescribed by statement of position no 
due to the length of time to manufacture and assemble the equipment 
aeroglide measures revenue based on the ratio of actual labor hours incurred in relation to the total estimated labor hours to be incurred related to the contract 
provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are made in the period in which losses are determined 
unanticipated changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
we believe that the percentage of completion method of accounting for these contracts most accurately reflects the status of these uncompleted contracts in the our consolidated financial statements business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment trademarks are considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
trademarks and goodwill will not be amortized 
however  we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining certain assumptions used in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the impairment test for trademarks requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material adverse effects in relationships with significant customers 
the implied fair value of reporting units is determined by management and generally is based upon future cash flow projections for the reporting unit  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it would be appropriate to do so 
intangibles subject to amortization  including customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of intangibles subject to amortization whenever indications of impairment are present 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset is expected to remain in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they may have changed from our initial assessment 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment  when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in the long lived assets physical condition 
when indicators of impairment are present  management determines whether the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the estimates of both the undiscounted future cash flows and the fair values of assets require the use of complex models  which require numerous highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
workers compensation liability cbs personnel self insures its workers compensation exposure for certain employees 
cbs personnel establishes reserves based upon its experience and expectations as to its ultimate liability for those claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
cbs personnel continually evaluates the potential for change in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of december   cbs personnel had approximately million of workers compensation liability 
the ultimate settlement of this liability could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate this liability  which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
deferred tax assets several of the majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
these deferred tax assets are comprised of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable 
see note k income taxes recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires companies to recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities 
the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
fin requires additional annual disclosures including interest and penalties 
we adopted fin as of january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our future consolidated financial statements 
in february the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in june the fasb ratified eitf no 
 or eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf requires non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas  which we will adopt on january  sfas will significantly change the accounting and reporting related to a non controlling interest in a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
after adoption  non controlling interests will be classified as shareholders equity  a change from its current classification between liabilities and shareholders equity 
earnings attributable to minority interests will be included in net income  although such earnings will continue to be deducted to measure earnings per share 
purchases and sales of minority interests will be reported in equity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit agreement because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility portion of our credit agreement at december  on january  we fixed million of these outstanding borrowings with a floating to fixed interest rate swap with a bank 
our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on the remaining million is not deemed to be material to our financial condition or results of operations we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments or foreign present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
