overview we design  manufacture and market radio frequency  or rf  modules that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency signals in telecommunication networks  defense electronics and homeland security systems 
our rf modules are typically used in high frequency applications and include integrated transceivers  amplifiers  synthesizers  oscillators  up and down converters  frequency multipliers and microwave switch arrays 
markets and growth strategy telecommunications market 
most of our rf modules are deployed in telecommunication networks 
our target customers for these applications are telecommunication network original equipment manufacturers and systems integrators  collectively referred to in this report as telecom oems 
telecom oems provide the wireless equipment used by service providers to deliver voice  data and video services to businesses and consumers 
telecom oems that purchased our products accounted for of our total revenues during from to  we experienced a decrease of in our telecommunications related revenues 
the decline in revenues in was due primarily to decreased demand from our telecommunications customers and lower average sales prices of our modules 
during april  two of our largest customers  nokia and siemens  merged their telecommunications network businesses and created nokia siemens networks 
during  we experienced a decrease in revenues from the former siemens product lines of nokia siemens networks as they decreased purchases of legacy products that historically have been outsourced to us 
the ongoing impact  if any  of this merger on our continuing relationship with the combined company is uncertain 
defense electronics and homeland security system markets 
our rf devices and modules are also designed into various applications outside of the telecommunication network market  including defense electronics and homeland security systems 
our target customers in the defense electronics market include defense systems integrators and their subcontractors that design aerospace systems  defense systems  weapons and electronics platforms for domestic and foreign defense customers 
our target customers in the homeland security market include those customers that are utilizing the properties of high frequency rf to create new capabilities designed to detect security threats 
from to  we experienced growth of in our defense and homeland security related revenues 
such revenues  accounted for approximately of our total revenues in we continue to seek growth through enhancing our position as a leading merchant supplier of rf modules  continuing our expansion into the defense electronics and homeland security markets and pursuing strategic acquisitions 
in support of this growth strategy  on april   we announced the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of privately held alc microwave  inc  or alc  a provider of logarithmic amplifier subsystems to defense markets  for approximately million in cash 
we also believe the demand for high frequency rf modules within various defense electronics and homeland security systems is increasing 
we are seeing increased demand in defense electronics systems as high frequency rf modules are being used in 
table of contents sophisticated radar systems  electronic warfare systems  intelligent battlefield systems and high capacity communication systems 
due to the need for greater resolution  more comprehensive real time information and better communication on the battlefield  the united states military s demand for high frequency rf modules in the defense electronics market is growing 
similarly  the global escalation of terrorist and insurgency threats is resulting in increased governmental and private concern over providing adequate security measures 
many new  more capable systems are utilizing high frequency rf signals for various detection and imaging systems applied to threats of violence 
growth through acquisitions 
we continue to seek growth through strategic acquisitions 
since our initial public offering in october  we have acquired and integrated six businesses or product lines 
as a result of these transactions  we have increased our revenues and market share  broadened our product portfolio  diversified our customer base  gained expertise outside our core telecommunication network market and added key members to our staff 
seasonality we believe that the telecommunications market we serve can have an underlying seasonal pattern characterized by lower activity levels in the first and third calendar quarters  normal activity in the second calendar quarter and a surge of activity in the fourth calendar quarter 
reduced activity in the first quarter is due to delays in purchasing resulting from wireless carriers budgeting processes while reduced activity in the third quarter occurs as many of the european telecom oems shut down their factories for a portion of the summer months 
activity can expand in the fourth quarter as the wireless carriers expend their remaining capital budgets for the year 
the underlying telecommunications market trends notwithstanding  we have not experienced these seasonal patterns in our or revenue 
similarly  while the us government budgeting process can result in seasonal variations in activity  we have not seen a corresponding pattern in our revenues from our defense electronics customers 
we cannot be certain what seasonal market factors  if any  will impact our revenues in the future or the extent of such potential fluctuations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  stock based compensation  income taxes  asset impairments and other commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  below 
revenue recognition our primary customers are telecom oems and defense and homeland security systems integrators that incorporate our products into their systems 
we recognize product revenues at the time title passes  which is generally upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location  coupled with persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues under development contracts are generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis  using project hours as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenues 
alternatively  where a development contract specifies defined progress gates or milestones tied to payments  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis matching the milestone s 
revenues attributable to development fees accounted for of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in the costs incurred under these development agreements are included in research and development expenses 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our reserves  which were  at december  and  at december   historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our selling  general and administrative expenses would increase 
warranty reserves we generally offer a twelve to thirty month warranty on all of our products 
we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product revenues the amount of such costs at the time revenues are recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
at december  and our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes review of materials usage  market conditions and product life cycles and an analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand and market conditions 
we establish a reserve for inventories that are considered excess or obsolete 
we adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of product revenues  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
all of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method provides a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
consistent with prior years  we use the with and without approach as described in emerging issues task force topic no 
d in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
sfas no 
r prohibits the recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not yet been realized 
as a result  
table of contents we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on items such as the alternative minimum tax  the research tax credit or the domestic manufacturing deduction through the consolidated statements of operations rather than through paid in capital 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares under our stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
and our prior period pro forma disclosures of net loss  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 

the fair value of each option grant and the shares under our stock purchase plan are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model and the graded vesting method with assumptions concerning expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the award 
deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we have recorded a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
long lived assets we periodically review our property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenues and expense growth rates  the estimated royalty rates used for the valuation of acquired tradenames  and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between the intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the valuation of our intangible assets is based on an income approach methodology that values the intangible assets based on the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life discounted to its present value utilizing an appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the carrying value of goodwill was million and the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets was million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
to the extent the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge to income is recorded 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of september  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
we have determined that no events have occurred from that date through december  that would require an updated analysis 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of potential impairment exist 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results
