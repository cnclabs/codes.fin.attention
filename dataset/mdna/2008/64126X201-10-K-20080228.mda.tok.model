critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected

significant contracts we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with north american portability management llc  an industry group that represents all telecommunications service providers in the united states 
we recognize revenue under our contracts with north american portability management llc primarily on a per transaction basis 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under these contracts are determined by the total number of transactions  and these fees are billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share is based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenue of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
on november   bellsouth corporation filed a petition seeking changes in the way our customers are billed for services provided by us under our contracts with north american portability management llc 
in response to the bellsouth petition  the fcc solicited comments from other interested parties 
as of february   the fcc had not indicated whether it will take any action based on this petition  and the bellsouth petition remains pending 
we do not believe that the proposed change to the manner in which we bill for services under these contracts would have a material impact on our customers demand for these services 
in addition  on june   telcordia technologies  inc filed a petition with the fcc requesting an order that would require north american portability management llc to conduct a new bidding process to appoint a provider of telephone number portability services in the united states 
as of february   the fcc had not initiated a formal rulemaking process  and the telcordia petition remains pending 
under our contracts  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
the per transaction pricing under these contracts provided for annual volume based credits that were earned on all transactions in excess of the pre determined annual volume threshold 
for and  the maximum aggregate volume based credit was million  which was applied via a reduction in per transaction pricing once the pre determined annual volume threshold was surpassed 
when the aggregate credit was fully satisfied  the per transaction pricing was restored to the prevailing contractual rate 
in both and  the pre determined annual transaction volume threshold under these contracts was exceeded  which resulted in the issuance of million of volume based credits for both years 
in september  we amended our contracts with north american portability management llc 
under these amended terms  there are no volume based credits that were applied in or will be applied in later fiscal periods 
service level standards pursuant to certain of our private commercial contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that required service levels that would trigger such a penalty have not been met  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
for more information regarding how we recognize revenue for each of our service categories  please see the discussion above under revenue recognition 
goodwill we have made numerous acquisitions  including the acquisitions of ultradns corporation and followap inc  resulting in our recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as other definite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of impairment 
for purposes of our annual impairment test  we have identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units  our clearinghouse segment and our ngm segment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets  including assigned goodwill  to the book value of its net assets  including assigned goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using both an income and market approach 
to assist in the process of determining if a goodwill impairment exists  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available  and we may obtain appraisals from external advisors 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value  the assigned goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the fair value is less than the reporting unit s net book value  we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
the second step would be to compare the book value of the reporting unit s assigned goodwill to the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  using a theoretical purchase price allocation based on this implied fair value to determine the magnitude of the impairment 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
the goodwill impairment test and the determination of the fair value of intangible assets involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions by management  and are inherently subjective 
in particular  for each of our reporting units  the significant assumptions used include market penetration  anticipated growth rates  and risk adjusted discount rates for the income approach  as well as the selection of comparable companies and comparable transactions for the market approach 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
specifically  for our ngm reporting unit  due to the early stage of its operations and the emerging nature of mobile instant messaging technology  key assumptions incorporated within the valuation have a higher degree of subjectivity and are more likely to change over time 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable 
however  any changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which there is identifiable assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with north american portability management llc  we bill a rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
the rrc fees are recorded as an accrued liability when collected 
for the period from january  through june   this fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to 
any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
income tax provision includes us federal  state and local income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
the provision or benefit for income taxes is based upon our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate 
in determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by us on january  fin provides a two step approach to recognize and measure tax benefits when the benefits realization is uncertain 
the first step is to determine whether the benefit is to be recognized  the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized 
income tax benefits should be recognized when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  the entity believes that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and were taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin upon adoption is to be reported as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  including the fair value recognition provisions  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal and forward includes a compensation cost for all stock based awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  prior periods are not restated 
for stock based awards subject to graded vesting  we have utilized the straight line method for allocating compensation cost by period 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock based compensation as an operating cash flow in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
beginning on january   we changed our cash flow presentation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits to be classified as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
both prior and subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimated the value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the value of each stock based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under sfas no 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our stock based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based awards in the future 
certain stock based awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
although the fair value of our stock based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
acquisitions we have expanded the scope of our services and increased our customer base through selective acquisitions 
our objective for each acquisition was to expand the scope of the services that we provide and to leverage our clearinghouse capabilities in order to maximize efficiency and provide added value to our customers 
ultradns corporation on april   we acquired ultradns corporation for million in cash and acquisition costs of million 
the acquisition further expanded our domain name services and our internet protocol technologies 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with sfas no 
of the total cash consideration  approximately million was distributed to an escrow account for indemnification claims as set forth in the acquisition agreement 
funds remaining in the account were distributed to the former stockholders of ultradns in accordance with the acquisition agreement following the first anniversary of the acquisition 
of the total purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible assets acquired and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
we utilized a third party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of the definite lived intangible asset base 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the identifiable intangible assets 
the million of definite lived intangible assets acquired consists of the value assigned to ultradns s direct customer relationships of million  web customer relationships of million  acquired technology of million  and trade names of million 
we are amortizing the value of the ultradns direct and web customer relationships in proportion to the respective discounted cash flows over an estimated useful life of and years  respectively 
both acquired technology and trade names are being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
followap inc on november   we acquired followap inc for million in cash and acquisition costs of million along with the assumption and payment of certain followap debt and other liabilities of million 
the acquisition further expanded our internet protocol technologies  which is a key strategic initiative for us 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with sfas no 
of the total cash consideration  approximately million was distributed to an escrow account for indemnification claims as set forth in the acquisition agreement 
the acquisition agreement provides that  following the first anniversary of the acquisition and the resolution of any pending claims  all funds remaining in the account will be distributed to the former stockholders and optionholders of followap in accordance with the acquisition agreement 
of the total estimated purchase price  a preliminary estimate of million has been allocated to net tangible liabilities assumed and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
we utilized a third party valuation in determining the fair value of the definite lived intangible asset base 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the identifiable intangible assets 
the million of definite lived intangible assets acquired consists of the value assigned to followap s customer relationships of million and acquired technology of million 
we are amortizing the value of the followap customer relationships using an accelerated basis over five years and the value of the acquired technology on a straight line basis over years 
current trends affecting our results of operations in  we made substantial investments in areas of our business that we believe will serve as the foundation for our future growth namely  our telephone number portability platform  ultra services and mobile instant messaging 
in particular  we focused our efforts and resources on enhancing and developing our systems and platforms  and to hiring and retaining necessary personnel  to position us to take advantage of the developing opportunities that we see in the market 
increased demand for our telephone number portability services  which has been driven by market trends such as the implementation of new technologies  expansion of new applications and end user services  has driven increased transaction volume in our clearinghouse 
as the communications industry continues to evolve and change  we believe that we will experience continued demand for our addressing  interoperability and infrastructure services 
to meet increased demand for our services  we will continue to work with our customers to identify the problems that they are facing  and develop solutions for those problems through our existing services as well as the development of new features and functionalities 
we continued to see increased demand for secure  reliable and scalable dns systems  which was driven predominantly by enterprises with increasing reliance on the internet as a key enabling technology for the operation of their businesses 
we believe that enterprises will continue to increase their reliance on the internet and their dns based systems to run their businesses 
as a result  we expect the demand for neustar ultra services to increase over time 
we expect continued growth in wireless communications and competition among mobile network operators  as well as continued development of new wireless applications  such as mobile instant messaging  or mobile im 
based on our experience in  and the early development of the mobile instant messaging market  we believe that mobile network operators will continue to launch and support mobile im  which will result in increased demand for our solutions 
we anticipate making further investments in our business to support our ability to take advantage of our long term growth opportunities  particularly for those businesses that we have acquired and in areas where we may acquire business in the future 
for example  we made  and anticipate making  substantial investments in additions to our sales force  increased facilities and personnel in international markets  and have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs related to the marketing of our expanded services and solutions 
this use of resources may affect our operating margins 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended december  and vs

total revenue increased million due primarily to increases in infrastructure transactions under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states  our expanded range of dns services  and growth in the use of us common short codes 
addressing 
addressing revenue increased million due to the expanded range of dns services we offer as a result of our acquisition of ultradns corporation in april  and the continued increase in the use of us common short codes 
specifically  revenue from dns services increased million  consisting of a million increase in revenue from increased use of our neustar ultra services  and a million increase in revenue from an increased number of domain names under management 
in addition  revenue from us common short codes increased million due to an increased number of subscribers for us common short codes 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in revenue under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states 
we believe that this reduction in addressing revenue was due to a return to normal network expansion activities by carriers from unusually high levels in  and the reduced pricing under these contracts that went into effect on january  interoperability 
interoperability revenue increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse revenue increased predominantly due to increased demand for telephone number portability services in advance of the introduction of wireless number portability in canada 
specifically  revenue from telephone number portability services in canada increased million  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states due to decreased competitive churn 
ngm revenue was million  which was driven by an expansion of the number of carrier customers utilizing inter carrier services and the initial stages of end user adoption of mobile instant messaging 
we acquired the ngm business at the end of november  thus there was no corresponding ngm revenue in infrastructure and other 
infrastructure and other revenue increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse revenue increased predominantly due to increased demand for our network management services  primarily due to customers making changes to their networks that required actions such as disconnects and modifications to network elements 
we believe these changes were driven largely by trends in the industry  including the implementation of new technologies by our customers  such as wireless technology upgrades and network optimization 
in addition  infrastructure revenue from our ngm business segment increased million  which was driven by an expansion of the number of carrier customers utilizing intra carrier services and the initial stages of end user adoption of mobile instant messaging 
expense cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse cost of revenue increased due to an increase of million in royalty expenses related to us common short code services 
this increase was offset by a reduction of million in personnel and personnel related expense  which was driven by increased operating efficiencies relating to support of our platforms  and a reduction of million in contractor costs and professional fees 
ngm cost of revenue totaled million for  representing a million increase over the one month of cost of revenue we incurred following our acquisition of followap in november sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse sales and marketing expense increased million in personnel and personnel related expense due primarily to additions to our sales and marketing team to focus on branding  product launches  expanded dns service offerings  and new business development opportunities  including international expansion 
in addition  external costs and other general marketing expense increased million 
ngm sales and marketing expense totaled million for  representing a million increase over the one month of sales and marketing expense we incurred following our acquisition of followap in november research and development 
research and development expense increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse research and development expense increased million in personnel and personnel related expense due primarily to additions to our research and development team to support our service offerings 
ngm research and development expense totaled million for  representing a million increase over the one month of research and development expense we incurred following our acquisition of followap in november general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million  of which million was attributable to our clearinghouse business segment and million was attributable to our ngm business segment 
clearinghouse general and administrative expense increased million in personnel and personnel related expense due to increased headcount to support business growth

for further discussion of the operating results of our clearinghouse business segment and our ngm business segment  including revenue  income loss from operations  total assets  goodwill  and intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund acquisitions  facility expansions  capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements 
we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and facility expansion 
total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   an increase from million at december  this increase was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
debt and credit facilities on february   we entered into a credit agreement  which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a eurodollar rate plus a spread ranging from to  or at a base rate plus a spread ranging from to  with such spread in each case depending on the ratio of our consolidated senior funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
this credit agreement expires on february  as of february   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility  but available borrowings were reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes and to finance acquisitions as permitted by the terms of this credit agreement 
our credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and events of default 
our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest charge ratio and a maximum consolidated senior funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the new credit agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with these covenants

the fund currently has a projected redemption schedule that will result in approximately percent of the fund being redeemed in as of december   we recorded an unrealized loss of  related to this fund 
as of february   we had redeemed million and have million remaining in this fund 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this million increase was principally the result of a million reduction to the cash outflow relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  and a million increase in net income offset by a million increase in other non cash adjustments primarily related to depreciation and amortization resulting predominantly from our acquisitions 
cash flows from investing net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to a decrease of million in cash paid for acquisitions  which was partially offset by a million increase in the purchase of short term investments and a million increase in purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of a decrease of million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
in addition  the overall decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from a decrease in proceeds of million from the exercise of common stock options and million of shares repurchased by us during the year ended december  pursuant to the exercise by stock incentive plan participants of their right to elect to use common stock to satisfy their tax withholding obligations 
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations long term debt total the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment 
we do not believe that inflation had any material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 to permit all entities to choose to elect  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date  and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of sfas no 
an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying sfas no 
 unless it chooses early adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is prohibited 
in the absence of any planned future business combinations  we do not currently expect sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained non controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the statement also establishes reporting requirements that require sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is prohibited 
in the absence of any noncontrolling minority interests  we do not currently expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas b  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which would delay the effective date of sfas no 
 or all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the effective date would be delayed by one year to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp fas b  together with sfas  on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which  effective january   expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in sab no 
sab  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the simplified method  the expected term is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option 
in particular  sab provides for a company s election to use the simplified method  regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates of expected term 
the use of the simplified method was scheduled to expire on december   as it was anticipated that more detailed external information about employee exercise behavior would become available 
sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we expect to continue our use of the simplified method for awards issued after december  until such time that historical exercise information provides a more reliable estimate of the expected term 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the approximately million of short term investments owned by us at december  such investments consist principally of high grade auction rate securities and us government or corporate debt securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates would have reduced our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately  in addition  we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services
