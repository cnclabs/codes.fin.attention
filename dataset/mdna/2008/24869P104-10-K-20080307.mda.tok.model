item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview denny s revenues are derived primarily from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company owned restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the denny s name 
sales are affected by many factors including competition  economic conditions affecting consumer spending  weather and changes in guest tastes and preferences 
two primary sales drivers are changes in same store sales and the number of restaurants 
same store sales are comprised of the changes in guest check average and guest counts 
the franchise growth initiative fgi is a strategic initiative to increase franchise restaurant development through the sale of certain geographic clusters of company restaurants to both current and new franchisees 
as a result of the fgi  company owned units decreased by units and franchise units increased by units during included in the unit changes were the opening of five company owned and franchise restaurants 
we expect that the majority of new denny s restaurants will be developed by our franchisees 
development of company owned restaurants will focus on flagship locations in denny s core markets 
our costs of company owned restaurant sales are exposed to volatility in two main areas product costs and payroll and benefit costs 
many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility 
this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable 
in general  we purchase food products based on market prices  or we lock in prices in purchase agreements with our vendors 
in addition  some of our purchasing agreements contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing price ceilings and or floors 
while we will address commodity cost increases which are significant and considered long term in nature by adjusting menu prices  competitive circumstances can limit such actions 
payroll and benefit costs volatility results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs 
a number of our employees are paid the minimum wage 
accordingly  substantial increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
additionally  declines in guest counts and investments in store level labor can cause payroll and benefit costs to increase as a percentage of sales 
many of our costs vary based on sales and unit count 
however  certain costs such as occupancy  other operating expenses and general and administrative expenses have fixed components that may not react as directly to changes in sales and unit count 
franchise and license revenues are the revenues received by denny s from its franchisees and include royalties based on a percentage of sales of franchisee operated restaurants  initial franchise fees and occupancy revenue related to restaurants leased or subleased to franchisees 
the sale of restaurants to franchisees can result in an increase in occupancy revenue  regardless of whether we own or lease the underlying real estate 
where feasible  when restaurant operations are sold to franchisees  we intend to sell the underlying owned real estate to either the franchisees or other interested parties 
the sale of owned real estate properties that are leased to franchisees results in a decline in occupancy revenue 
generally  we remain obligated for rent payments related to properties that are subleased to franchisees 
our costs of franchise and license revenue include occupancy costs related to restaurants leased or subleased to franchisees and direct costs consisting primarily of payroll and benefit costs of franchise operations personnel and bad debt expense 
franchise and licensing revenues are generally billed and collected from franchisees on a weekly basis which minimizes the impact of bad debts on our costs of franchise and license revenues 
interest expense has a significant impact on our net income loss as a result of our indebtedness 
however  during and  we continued to reduce interest expense through a series of debt repayments using the proceeds generated from the fgi transactions  sale of real estate and cash flow from operations 
these repayments resulted in an overall debt reduction of more than million in both and we are subject to the effects of interest rate volatility since approximately of our debt has variable interest rates 
to minimize the interest rate volatility  during  we entered into an interest rate swap on the first million of floating rate debt 
as of december   the swap effectively increases our ratio of fixed rate debt from approximately of total debt to approximately of total debt

we have provided valuation allowances related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to our net operating losses generated in previous periods 
in establishing our valuation allowance  we had previously taken into consideration certain tax planning strategies involving the sale of appreciated properties 
the increased deferred tax provision of million for the year ended december  related to our reevaluation of our tax planning strategies in light of the sale of appreciated properties during the year 
in addition  during  we utilized certain state net operating loss carryforwards whose valuation allowance was established in connection with fresh start reporting on january  as a result  we recorded approximately million of state deferred tax expense with a corresponding reduction to the goodwill that was recorded in connection with fresh start reporting on january  as a result of adopting sfas r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax of million in the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  due to the factors noted above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations  borrowing under our credit facilities as described below and cash proceeds from the sale of company restaurants to franchisees and the sale of real estate 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt repayments 
the following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for  combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility  will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures through the end of net cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended december  these cash flows primarily represent net proceeds of million on sales of restaurant operations to franchisees  real estate and other assets 
the proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   of which million was financed through capital leases 
our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the maintenance of our existing company owned restaurants and facilities  new construction  remodeling and our strategic initiatives  as follows fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands facilities   new construction   remodeling   strategic initiatives  other   capital expenditures   cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   which included million of term loan prepayments and million of scheduled term loan payments made through a combination of asset sale proceeds  as noted above  and cash generated from operations 
our credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility including up to million for a revolving letter of credit facility  a million term loan and an additional million letter of credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the previous million letter of credit facility was reduced to million 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million comprised of million under our letter of credit facility and million under our revolving facility 
there were no revolving loans outstanding at december  these balances result in availability of million under our letter of credit facility and million under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility matures on december  the term loan and the million letter of credit facility mature on march  the term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate equal to approximately per annum with all remaining amounts due on the maturity date 
the revolving facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances such as the sale of specified properties typical for this type of credit facility and may make certain optional prepayments under the credit facility 
the credit facility is guaranteed by denny s and its other subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of denny s and its subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by first priority mortgages on company owned real estate assets 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants ie  maximum total debt to ebitda as defined under the credit facility ratio requirements  maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio requirements  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and limitations on capital expenditures  negative covenants  conditions precedent  material adverse change provisions  events of default and other terms  conditions and provisions customarily found in credit agreements for facilities and transactions of this type 
we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility as of december  as of december   interest on loans under the revolving facility is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points and will adjust over time based on our leverage ratio 
interest on the term loan and letter of credit facility is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points 
the weighted average interest rate under the term loan was as of december  our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consist of the following payments due by period total less than year years years years and thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations interest obligations a pension and other defined contribution plan obligations b purchase obligations c total a interest obligations represent payments related to our long term debt outstanding at december  for long term debt with variable rates  we have used the rate applicable at december  to project interest over the periods presented in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for balances and terms of the credit facility and the notes due the notes at december  the capital lease obligation amounts above are inclusive of interest 
b pension and other defined contribution plan obligations are estimates based on facts and circumstances at december  amounts cannot currently be estimated for more than one year 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
c purchase obligations include amounts payable under purchase contracts for food and non food products 
in most cases  these agreements do not obligate us to purchase any specific volumes and include provisions that would allow us to cancel such agreements with appropriate notice 
amounts included in the table above represent our estimate of purchase obligations during the periods presented if we were to cancel these contracts with appropriate notice 
we would likely take delivery of goods under such circumstances 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  effective december   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
at december   we had a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including potential interest and penalties totaling million 
due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
at december   our working capital deficit was million compared with million at december  we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
off balance sheet arrangements during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt 
we designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on the first million of floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based on the month libor rate for a term ending on march   effectively resulting in a fixed rate of on the million notional amount 
interest rate differentials paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
prior to december   gains and losses on the swap were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of shareholders deficit and comprehensive income loss in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to the swap ie  interest payments on the first million of floating rate debt were no longer probable of occurring over the term of the interest rate swap as a result of the probability of paying the debt down below million through scheduled repayments and prepayments with cash from the sale of company restaurant operations to franchisees 
as a result  we discontinued hedge accounting treatment and recorded approximately million of losses as a component of other nonoperating expense income  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining million in derivative losses in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to other nonoperating expense over the remaining term of the interest rate swap 
through february   the fair value of the swap decreased by an additional million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to self insurance liabilities  impairment of long lived assets  and restructuring and exit costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities 
we record liabilities for insurance claims during periods in which we have been insured under large deductible programs or have been self insured for our medical and dental claims and workers compensation  general product and automobile insurance liabilities 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from million to million per individual claim for workers compensation and for general product and automobile liability 
the liabilities for prior and current estimated incurred losses are discounted to their present value based on expected loss payment patterns determined by independent actuaries using our actual historical payments 
these estimates include assumptions regarding claims frequency and severity as well as changes in our business environment  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact our overall self insurance costs 
total discounted insurance liabilities at december  and december  were million reflecting a discount rate and million reflecting a discount rate  respectively 
the related undiscounted amounts at such dates were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the restaurant level on a quarterly basis or whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of restaurant level assets based on the operating cash flows of the restaurant and our plans for restaurant closings 
generally  all units with negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months at each quarter end are included in our assessment 
in performing our assessment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from similar asset sales  and other factors to determine both the recoverability and the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant are not recoverable based upon estimated future  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  for underperforming restaurants  including restaurants closed 
these charges are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had a total of three restaurants with an aggregate net book value of approximately million  after taking into consideration impairment charges recorded  which had negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months 
restructuring and exit costs 
as a result of changes in our organizational structure and in our portfolio of restaurants  we have recorded charges for restructuring and exit costs 
these costs consist primarily of the costs of future obligations related to closed units and severance and other restructuring charges for terminated employees 
these costs are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
discounted liabilities for future lease costs and the fair value of related subleases of closed units are recorded when the units are closed 
all other costs related to closed units are expensed as incurred 
in assessing the discounted liabilities for future costs of obligations related to closed units  we make assumptions regarding amounts of future subleases 
if these assumptions or their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
exit costs recorded for each of the periods presented include the effect of such changes in estimates 
the most significant estimate included in our accrued exit costs liabilities relates to the timing and amount of estimated subleases 
at december   our total discounted liability for closed units was approximately million  net of million related to existing sublease agreements and million related to properties for which we expect to enter into sublease agreements in the future 
if any of the estimates noted above or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets do not include future tax benefits that we deem likely not to be realized 
share based compensation 
as required by sfas r  stock based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective december   the first day of fiscal  we adopted fin this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements 
fin does not require or permit retrospective application  thus the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  if any  is recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first fiscal period beginning on or after december  sfas r will also require that any additional reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in connection with fresh start reporting on january  be recorded as a component of income tax expense rather than as currently reflected as a reduction to the goodwill established in connection with the fresh start reporting 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r on our consolidated financial statements

in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in our consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  this statement requires that the consolidated net income attributable the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement 
sfas is effective for the first fiscal period beginning on or after december  we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value options for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after november  we may choose to apply sfas to eligible items  existing as of the effective date  in the first quarter of fiscal while we continue to review the provisions of sfas  we have not yet identified any assets or liabilities for which we currently believe we will elect the fair value reporting option 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas for financial assets and liabilities  as well as any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements  are effective for the first fiscal period beginning after november  the provisions for nonfinancial assets and liabilities are effective for the first fiscal period beginning after november  we are required to adopt sfas for financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption

specifically  borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread of basis points per annum for the term loan and letter of credit facility and basis points per annum for the revolving credit facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on the first million of floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based on the month libor rate for a term ending on march   effectively resulting in a fixed rate of on the million notional amount 
as of december   the swap effectively increases our ratio of fixed rate debt from approximately of total debt to approximately of total debt 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by basis points our annual cash flow and income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the variable rate portion of the credit facility at december  however  the nature and amount of our borrowings under the credit facility may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our other outstanding long term debt bears fixed rates of interest 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate long term debt excluding capital lease obligations and revolving credit facility advances was approximately million compared with a book value of million at december  this computation is based on market quotations for the same or similar debt issues or the estimated borrowing rates available to us 
specifically  the difference between the estimated fair value of long term debt compared with its historical cost reported in our consolidated balance sheets at december  relates primarily to market quotations for our notes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our pension plan  other defined benefit plans and self insurance liabilities 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan and other defined benefit plans by million and million  respectively  and impact our net periodic benefit cost related to our pension plan by million 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate on periodic benefit costs related to our other defined benefit plans would be less than million 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate related to our self insurance liabilities would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products such as beef  poultry  pork  eggs and coffee  and utilities such as gas and electricity  which are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable 
changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors generally and often simultaneously 
in general  we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors 
although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  the majority of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing fixed pricing and or price ceilings and floors 
we use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
we have determined that our purchasing agreements do not qualify as derivative financial instruments or contain embedded derivative instruments 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  competitive circumstances could limit such actions and  in those circumstances  increases in commodity prices could lower our margins 
because of the often short term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases  we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant 
we have established a policy to identify  control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes
