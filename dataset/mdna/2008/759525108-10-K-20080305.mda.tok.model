item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary during  our business slowed compared with the prior year 
sales  gross margins and operating income in were lower than last year 
for sales decreased approximately million  compared to last year 
this included a million decline in sales of p digital products 
sales of analog products decreased compared to the prior year 
during many of our customers struggled with limited  or the absence of lmr funding 
although we penetrated several federal agencies with which we had not previously done business  funding and economic factors precluded them from significantly impacting total sales 
these limitations also resulted in reduced sales of p digital products compared to last year 
although federal funding remains unpredictable  the approval in january of a federal budget improves the prospects for funding to our customers  which in turn could stimulate lmr procurements in gross margins as a percent of sales for the year ended december  were compared to in the prior year  reflecting the reduction of p products in our sales mix and reduced total sales 
overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a result of lower sales commissions  and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
we have  however  expanded our sales and marketing staff in furtherance of our efforts to drive sales growth and penetrate new markets and customers 
our p product development program is continuing and expected to yield in early the introduction of our first product in a line of next generation p digital radios 
this product line  we believe  will broaden our addressable market and facilitate our efforts for new sales growth 
income before income tax for the year ended december  decreased million to approximately million compared to pretax income of approximately million last year 
income tax expense for both and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the expense is almost entirely non cash  the result of utilizing our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
net income for totaled approximately million per basic share and per fully diluted share  compared to approximately million per basic share and per fully diluted share last year 
our balance sheet as of december  remained strong with approximately million in cash and million in working capital with no long term debt 
in october  we paid to stockholders a special cash dividend of per share million in the aggregate 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percent of sales percent of sales for year ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses net interest income expense other income expense income before income tax expense income taxes benefit expense net income fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net net sales for decreased by approximately million to approximately million from approximately million for  with sales declining in both of our markets 
the decline was attributed primarily to the government and public safety market  which comprised approximately of total sales for the year 
sales of p digital products decreased to million  or of total sales  compared with million  or of total sales  for the prior year 
our customers in this market were impacted by budget and funding constraints  as the federal government operated without an approved budget throughout the year 
these circumstances resulted in reduced procurement activity from our largest existing customer agencies 
we successfully penetrated new federal and state agencies during the year 
the funding environment  however  limited their impact on product sales 
in january  a federal budget was approved for the government s fiscal year ending september  this  we believe  improves our customers and potential customers prospects for access to funding in also  the first product in our line of next generation p digital radios was approved by the fcc in december we plan to broaden the line during by following with models in additional frequency ranges 
successful execution of these developments will provide us with access to new markets and customers that heretofore we have been unable to serve  including agencies of homeland security and the military 
we believe the migration of government and public safety two way radio users to p digital technology will continue and serve as a catalyst for future growth in digital sales and total sales 
sales of conventional analog products in decreased approximately from the previous year 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for increased to from last year 
the cost of products includes non cash share based employee compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales and  of sales for and  respectively 
changes in our cost of products are primarily related to product mix and manufacturing volume 
during  particularly during the first and fourth quarters  sales of p digital products and higher margin analog products were lower and comprised a smaller portion of reduced total sales compared to the previous year 
also  with reduced total sales  manufacturing volumes decreased  and therefore we did not fully utilize and absorb our base of manufacturing and support expenses 
these factors combined to increase product costs as a percentage of sales and decrease gross margins 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
as sales volumes increase  and the anticipated growth of p product sales resumes  we believe we will realize improved cost efficiencies and gross margin performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters  and non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
for the year ended december   sg a expenses totaled approximately million of sales compared to approximately million of sales for sg a expenses include non cash share based employee compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales and  of sales in and  respectively 
engineering and product development expenses in decreased by approximately  compared to last year 
this decrease was primarily non cash share based employee compensation expense recorded the prior year 
the cost necessary to execute our p new product development plans will continue 
our development program is intended to enhance our position by designing additional p digital products with competitive advantages 
we believe such products will be a primary source of sales growth in the future 
bringing them to market and achieving a significant share of the market will continue to require investment 
marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately  for compared to last year 
this decrease was primarily the result of sales commission expenses  which declined directly as a result of lower sales revenues 
this was partially offset by the addition of direct sales staff and related sales and marketing expenses  all of which are designed to raise and enhance our profile  penetrate new customers and drive sales growth  particularly from government and public safety opportunities for p digital products 
general and administrative expenses for increased by approximately  compared to last year 
increases in costs associated primarily with the implementation of a new enterprise wide computer system  property insurance  public company and other headquarters related expenses were partially offset by decreases in non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
operating income operating income for decreased approximately million compared to last year 
during  total sales decreased and the mix of product sales was less favorable  with the decline in sales of higher margin p digital products  compared to last year 
these factors combined to adversely impact operating income 
interest income  net for  we earned approximately  in net interest income compared to  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and would incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the increase in net interest income is derived from our improved cash position throughout the year compared to last year

taxable income decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales and gross margins 
as of december   our deferred tax asset totaled approximately million 
this asset is primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
these nols are available for federal and state purposes  and expire through in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years prior to the expiration of our nols 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset 
the recognition of the net deferred tax asset and related tax benefit is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  our current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded at december  we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax asset may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record an additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset recorded as of december  fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales net sales for increased by approximately million to million from million for our growth in sales was driven primarily by p digital products sold to the government and public safety segment of the market  reflecting the industry wide increase in demand for such products  combined with our introduction of new products and penetration of new customers 
sales of our p digital products in increased approximately from during  we broadened our digital product offerings  introducing additional p digital products such as our dph cmd portable radio  our go box portable repeater and our digital mobile radio  as well as new digital capabilities such as encryption 
these developments helped to expand our addressable market 
government and public safety two way radio users  we believe  will continue migrating to products with p digital technology  which should serve as a catalyst for future growth in digital sales and total sales 
sales of conventional analog products in decreased approximately from the previous year 
although gains were realized in certain commercial and industrial market segments  demand for analog products in the government and public safety market declined during the year as more users migrated to newer product designs incorporating p digital technology 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for decreased to from for for  the cost of products included non cash share based employee compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales 
we did not recognize non cash share based employee compensation expense in contract manufacturing relationships have helped improve our production efficiencies and reduce material and labor costs 
they have also enabled us to effectively control internal manufacturing support expenses 
furthermore  we have been able to leverage increased sales volumes to improve our utilization of manufacturing related assets 
we believe further efficiencies and cost reductions can be realized from volume increases in the future 
the mix of products in our total sales also impacts the cost of products and gross margins 
for  sales of higher specification products that incorporate recent  more cost effective product designs  particularly p digital products  comprised a greater portion of our sales  yielding higher average selling prices and improved gross margins compared to the prior year 
we continuously evaluate manufacturing alternatives to improve quality and reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future

the additional investment in engineering and product development is intended to enhance our ability to complete and introduce new products  including additional p digital products 
marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately million for compared to last year 
this increase was the result of several factors 
commission expense increased directly as a result of increased sales revenues 
also  a greater portion of sales were derived from commissionable sources

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition

sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
united states generally accepted accounting principles has required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilit ate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of asset and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of our choice to use fair value on our earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on its financial condition and results of operations and does not believe that it will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the implementation of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this standard improves the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
under the new standard  noncontrolling interests are to be treated as a separate component of stockholders equity  not as a liability or other item outside of stockholders equity 
this standard also requires that increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership be accounted for as equity transactions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company does not expect that the implementation of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the ordinary course of business for borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at a variable rate 
the lender presently charges interest at the london interbank offering rate libor prime rate plus basis points 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding under this facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for disclosure our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables and the reserves for excess or obsolete inventory involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm s operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the united states government are recognized when the products are delivered 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and staff accounting bulletin no 
allowance for collection losses the allowance for collection losses was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
we maintain a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our allowance on trade receivables is approx imately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
we had no specific allowance as of december  inventory reserve the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year 
for raw material inventory with no usage in the past year  we reserve of its cost  which takes into account a scrap value  while for finished goods inventory with no usage in the past year we reserve of its cost 
for raw material inventory with usage in the past year  in order to get the most pertinent usage profile  we review the annual usage over the most recent three years  project that amount over a three year horizon  and reserve of the excess amount 
for finished goods and subassembly inventory with usage in the past year  we review the annual usage over the most recent three years  project that amount over a five year horizon  and reserve of the excess amount 
we believe that represents the value of excess inventory we would not be able to recover due to new product introductions and other technological advancements over the next five years 
we review actual recovery experience on the sale of excess or obsolete inventory in order to assure that the reserve and recovery percentages utilized in the analysis are reasonable 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect a more accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes  as modified by fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consoli dated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future
